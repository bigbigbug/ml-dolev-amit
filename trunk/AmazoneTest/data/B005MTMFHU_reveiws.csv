"20120610","5.0","The best camera I've ever owned and it's not even close","When reading this review, keep in mind that I'm not a technophile when it comes to cameras, don't know all that much about the jargon, etc.  I'm also not a person who has any interest in SLRs or fiddling with manual settings or who cares about RAW.  From what I've read of other reviews, if you fall into these categories, especially the need for RAW, this camera may not be you.  But for me personally, this is the single best camera I've ever owned, and my first Canon after years of Sony Cybershot point and shoots.I chose this camera for a two month stay in Japan after doing weeks and weeks of research on different cameras and weighing the pros and cons of each, so here are my own pros and cons after about two months of working with this camera (still in Japan by the way as of this review :)Pros:1. The 35x optical zoom is absolutely divine.  Superior ability to retain focus and so good, you can practically double the SX40 as binoculars.  It's that amazing.  For someone who had an excellent zoom as his #1A priority in getting a camera (#1 was image quality), I could not be happier with this feature.  Even my friends who are following my photoblog of Japan on Facebook have commented that the various different zoom pictures I've posted has made them want this camera.2. Terrific image quality, even in outdoor pictures.  I say that because traditionally from my own experience and those of friends/family members, Sony tends to have better outdoor picture cameras and Canon tends to be much better indoors/low-lighting.  This camera excels even the best Sony cameras I've had at outdoor pictures, which impresses the heck out of me.  Indoor/low-light image quality, is, of course, still miles ahead of anyone else.3.  As far as I can tell, the battery life is quite good on these.  I'd still have a spare battery with you just in case, but they seem to hold up really well.4.  The image stabilization is fantastic, just fantastic.  Even when my hands are shaky as all get out, the SX40 does a superb job of correcting for that deficiency, more so than any other camera I've ever used.Cons:1.  The only drawback that bothers me is every once in a great while (like say, maybe once every 700 or so pictures), there will be what look to be dust specks on a picture.  I think someone else reported something similar on another review, only for them it happened a lot more frequently than with mine.  Hopefully that low occurrence rate holds up.2.  If you're looking for something you can just put in your pocket and go.. well no, that's not going to work.  You're going to need to carry this in a camera bag that it'll fit in.  Fortunately I have a bag it fits in that isn't much trouble at all to haul around, but I still got a cheap backup compact point and shoot (the Sony DSC-W690, which I've written a review for as well).Overall Verdict:I love this camera, and while I like to change/upgrade cameras every few years, this is so far and away the best, most easy to use, most enjoyable camera I've ever had, that it will be a very long time before I look to replace it.  Its stellar zoom, image quality, and ease of use all make it the perfect camera for my own personal needs and desires, and at a price that won't break the bank or require advanced understanding of manual features like an SLR.""
"20120219","5.0","Everything I had hoped for.","I am not a photographer and so I did quite a bit of research before investing in a new camera. I read lots of reviews and several photography websites and blogs. I was upgrading from a Canon point-and-shoot that I loved but did not do well in low light. I nearly bought an entry-level DSLR but went with my gut and bought the SX40. I love that the lens is attached and I have no more parts to buy unless I want to (such as an external flash). I wanted a new camera primarily so that I could take pictures in low light at school programs, dance recitals, etc. I experimented at a school play--only stage lighting, no flash and from a distance, and the pictures were EXCELLENT. I had to hold the camera REALLY still of course, but even without a tri-pod got some really nice shots. I would recommend a tri-pod if you want to guarantee success in these situations. This camera has many functions to help you out. I recently used the snow setting to take some great frost shots on our farm. I have gotten so many complements on them. In the past few years I have bought and returned two cameras I did not like. But not this one!""
"20120218","5.0","Early review in prep for safari","Just took delivery of my SX 40 HS after reading dozens of reiews, comparing specifications and articles, watching You Tubes, etc. I wanted a new camera for an upcoming African mission trip with a possible short safari at its end. I have some Canon lenses that would have fit a new dslr body, but I was concerned about the bulk and weight of carrying lenses and was afraid of dust on the mirrors when changing lenses. Also, my current telephoto is a 75-300mm and would be underpowered absent a 2x magnifier. In any event,I expected a megazoom lense,but was quite concerned about image quality of a non-slr... just a hazy point and shoot. I have just shot several dozen photos of my dogs, granddaughter,etc just sitting in my familyroom on a low light non-flash basis and I am very impressed. Clarity is great. Without knowing really any of the features, I can create incredibly soft low light nearly portrait type photos. We live in the woods, so I went out to shoot some snow in the forest shots and they were very good,even though the filters I ordered are not here yet. Very early in my analysis... but do not be concerned about image quality.""
"20120217","5.0","Love it!","I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera.  The product is exactly as described.  The zoom is terrific.  I am still figuring out some of the settings, but so far, so good!""
"20120211","5.0","I Adore this camera.  And I've bought and returned a bunch...","This camera is brilliant.  The zoom and stabilization are what they advertise - the images are sharp, the focus is fast.  This is the fourth camera I've gone through trying to find a decent zoom and indoor shooting without flash in low light and this is The Answer.  Some other cameras (the Olympus Pen P1 comes to mind) take FOREVER to focus in low light, if they ever do (the Olympus wouldn't with the larger lens and the Panasonic Lumix I have does NOT take clear pics indoors without a flash).Also, I'm not one for gimmicky camera effects but, I must admit, I enjoy the Toy Camera and the Miniature settings.  I'm also, for the first time, taking bird pics at full zoom without a tripod IN FOCUS.  I am So Pleased.""
"20120211","5.0","Big BANG for the money!!!!!","Awesome camera. Works above and beyond my expectations. Ease of use, photo quality, end product, everything about this product is worth the investment.""
"20120210","4.0","Low light, not that good, but ZOOOOMMM!!!","This is my second Canon camera - the other one being a PowerShot SX110IS. I think Canon camera give a less grainy photo that the other point-n-shoot cameras, so I decided to get this. I have the skills to use a DSLR, but not the funds - so, I figured I'd use what little money I had to buy an intermediate one. After seeing the ZOOM shots with this camera, I was BLOWN away. Photos from this camera border on Spy stuff. BUT - you gotta hold it very steady at the far away distances (think tripod). On a full moon night, you CAN'T zoom all the way out (digital) - you would only get a PORTION of the moon! :-) The digital zoom shots are still pretty good (but of course not as good as non-digital).This camera has WAY more settings than my other one. I am still learning about the different modes. I mainly shoot in Aperture because most of my stuff is still life. I also shoot as pure as possible, and prefer to edit to my tastes in Photoshop. Therefore, I don't use a lot of the tricks the SX40 can do. I'm not sure about additions you can add (filters, etc), and I only shot a few videos just for the fun. I DID shot one video zooming and un-zooming in on the moon during the day. Because it was quiet where I was, the motor could CLEARLY be heard (LOUD) in the video.- Pros: 12MP, big zoom, movable view screen, 8fps burst- Cons: zoom motor records in video, can be slow in low light, doesn't seem to hold exposure with half press.""
"20120210","5.0","So far So good!","I am really enjoying my camera. I like to take pics of my kids. It is Not near as heavy and bulky as a dslr camera. And you Dont have to tote around a bunch of extra weight using extra lenses.  It has some neat settings as Well. The only thing i am having a hard time with is action shots. ..They come out blurry sometimes. But its the same with the dslr camera bc i had one and returned it.""
"20120210","5.0","GREAT DEAL","Hi everyone, actually this is the 1st time write a review. from my experience I got a great deal for this product.""
"20120210","5.0","Great camera","So far I was using Canon Powershot S2 IS since 2005. It is a great camera but I have to admit that its grand grand son SX40 hs is a superb machine. I still didn't have enough time to use its functions completely but my first impression is great. Well done Canon!!!""
"20120208","5.0","Great Canon","Great zoom ... but slow shutter. When take continuous shots it Mack bulerHave great focus with zoom .. I think to bay 100$ extra to buy Panasonic lumix gf3 . I think It is a great cam""
"20120207","5.0","Takes excellent pictures","I wanted something with more power than the SX130 had, and the SX40 HS does the job very well.  The image stabilization feature allows me to take 140X zoom shots while just leaning against something.  It is nice not to have to have a tripod for such powerful zoom shots.""
"20120205","5.0","Canon SX40 HS, Very satisfied","This product came a day earlier than expected. I've had it a couple of weeks now and have taken a number of pictures, mostly bird pictures. I was very satisfied with the pictures taken even at full telephoto. Very clear with correct color and in focus even though I was not using a tripod or monopod. I sent some of my pictures to friends who gave rave comments. I am completely satisfied.""
"20120205","5.0","SX40HS Is A 5-Star Winner","This part has nothing to do with the camera - just a short personal note.  For the past few years I have bought a new Canon high-end point & shoot (Like the SX30 or SX40) every year. Amazon normally has a decent discount around Thanksgiving. I keep all the original packaging & accessories from my old camera, take some really nice pics & can usually sell it on eBay around Christmas for about 15% less than I paid for it.  That way I can stay with the latest model and amortize the replacement cost of a new camera over about 5 - 6 years which I figure is about the life of the camera anyway.Now onto the camera ...........If you have an SX30 or earlier model, TRADE UP!  Three main reasons I'm sold on this model are:1) CMOS sensor - Although Canon downgraded this new model to 12 mp from 14mp on the SX30, the reduced noise on the SX40 is very evident if you do any extreme crops.2) Burst mode - In the last couple years we did an Alaska cruise and went to Sea World in San Diego.  I got a few nice shots of whales & porposes jumping - by dumb luck.  I had to try and judge when to shoot.  Tons of missed shots.  Wish I had the burst mode for these shooting conditions.3) Tracking face detection works great!I have not taken any night photos in years so the low light limitations a few people mentioned are not an issue with me.I have thought many times about upgrading to a DSLR to get some additional features.  I've always decided not to as I've found over the years (I'm retirement age) that I hated lugging multiple lenses, etc.  The addition of the CMOS sensor and burst mode has brought this camera very close, in my humble opinion, to a DSLR.  Plus the 35X optical zoom.  It would be hard to part with these features in this compact package & go to a DSLR.  I have to admit that I may look at the Sony Alpha Nex-7 when it hits the market - a compact DSLR with interchangeable lenses & 24mp.  Yum!  $1200 for the body & $800 for an 18-200mm zoom?  Well, on second thought ...............On March 28, 2012 I'll be adding a photo of a raptor (Cooper's hawk?) that I took from what I would guess would be around 200-300 feet & hand held.  I think the detail in the image is incredible for a camera under $400.""
"20120205","3.0","AF motor noise (hissing sound) when zooming in or out","The Canan SX40 (that I owned) has major AF motor noise (hissing sound) when zooming in or out - a deal breaker.After ~10 years using more than >10 various point-and-shoot cameras only from Canon, this time I am switching to Panasonic FZ150 which has much better auto-focus (speed and accuracy), and better picture quality (dark noise, maintain edges, depth, and dark level)...""
"20120204","5.0","settled on this one after many attempts to find "the one"","i've been searching for a bridge camera that would rival an slr/dslr for a long time.  i went through more than ten attempts. i really liked the panasonic fz150, but it's low light image quality was not good.  the sony hx100v had super video, but it was slow and had soft picture quality. i tried all the different settings i could to fix these issues. early in my search i did try the sx40, but had some issues with the lens motor.  but after all the cameras, i came back to it and am very happy.  it does not have video quality that matches the sony or panasonic (they both had the avchd video which is higher quality).  but as far as still images go, you can't beat it.  it will be the closest in any high priced bridge camera you can come to a dslr.  i took an image on auto of my cat inside (good lighting) and it came out fabulous.  it did seem to set a rather high iso-1600-but i had it printed to an 8x10 and it shows little if any noise-something the high end panasonic and sony won't do. i do wish it had a remote shutter release option. and i do wish it was as fast as the panasonic, but for most pictures it is so much better.  i bought a 58mm lens adapter here on amazon so i could put a filter on it (don't buy cheapie uv filters as it will degrade your photo quality and can mess up your focus).  and i also purchased a rubber collapsable screw in lens hood (about $5).  then i can use both filters and the hood together. or hood alone, or filter alone. after market batteries are really cheap and long lasting too (i bought two). even though i'm not a big fan of the video it produces (it's ok, but could be a little better-spoiled by the sony and panasonic, so if i had never seen them, i wouldn't know), it was the best of the three high end cameras for image quality. another advantage is that this camera is slightly lower in price. i do believe i'm pretty qualified to write this review as i've tried out over 10 cameras before sticking with this one!!!!  i think you'll like it!!!!!""

"20120131","4.0","Great vacation and everyday camera.","I own professional camera gear (Nikon D700), but honestly, I hate getting it out for daily pics or lugging it along on vacations. A pocket camera or cell phone camera can work for a lot of pics, but when you want a camera that is more robust than pocket size but not as cumbersome as a full size DSLR the Canon Powershot SX40 is perfect.I originally owned the SX30 and loved it. I just bought the SX40 to take along on a recent trip to Costa Rica (check my images on the main product page). This camera was PERFECT; large enough to be steady in my hands, the adjustable screen allowed for overhead or self pics, the video feature was great... but what I really bought it for was the ZOOM. Nothing comes close to what this camera can do in terms of zoom at this price point - again see my zoom comparison pics on the product main page.The main reason I upgraded was of the improved burst mode over the SX30 and a few more minor tweaks and better low light and focusing performance.The only thing I don't like is the lack of RAW images. But, for most people that is not an issue. I'd also like a more automatic way of composing HDR photos.Amateurs will love the full auto function and people with a bit more knowledge can find success with the manual controls.Buy with confidence!PS: Get good quality SD cards to use with this camera, especially if you're going to record video. I bought some good 32GB Class 10 cards on Amazon for about $40. Well worth it.""

I looked around the settings and found that it a slow motion setting (don't know the exact fps, but it's pretty high).The bad thing is... just kidding! so far I have had no problems at all with the camera.Thanks, Canon!""
"20120128","5.0","Great feature-packed camera","I did a lot of online study before deciding to order the SX40 HS. I wanted an ultra zoom camera to better capture shots of wildlife while backpacking. My ancient (by digital camera standards) Nikon Coolpix 100 was just not cutting it.The camera is very easy to use for quick point and shoot shots. I've mostly used it so far around the house to capture candid shots of our cats. Getting the most out of this camera's almost overwhelming array of features will take some study of its 220-page pdf manual (the paper Getting Started guide is only 35 pages long). One feature not mentioned in the reviews is Stitch Assist, which allows you to take panoramic shots. Stitch Assist holds the last image in the view screen while you compose the next shot. The exposure is set by the first shot, ensuring the shots will match better when merged into a panorama with the included software.So far I am very pleased with the quality of pictures I've been able to take. We even got a great full-screen shot of a bobcat curled up 30 feet from our house!""

It has enough settings for me to play around and have fun with, yet if I want, it can be just a  point and click camera I still have the option.  I love the turn around viewfinder and most of the settings.  Wish it would come with a better user guide though, to walk you through some areas of use.

I am also impressed with the battery.  I get well over 500 shot before I need to recharge.  If you want point and shoot that functions like a DSLR camera, then this is the one.  Best camera I have ever owned!""
"20120124","5.0","Wonderful all around camera-","Bought this camera for use in wildlife photography. Using my Canon SLR was being more of a chore due to the excess weight I'd have to carry around for hours.Also the 35X zoom was a major point for my buying this camera. I'd be in preserves with my SLR and long zooms and after a few hours would be exhausted. When you're tired you become careless about your shots, and I'd sometimes be unhappy with my images. Being a Canon user for years piqued my interest. Well I couldn't be more satisfied. Its light in weight, easy to carry around and with the new processor takes pictures comparable to my SLR's.You can take superb pictures, handheld,  with the 35X zoom. Still having the SX30 and comparing them, the SX40 appears to be faster, better in low light, and has clearer images.  Moon shots come out clear with craters sharply shown. Videos are very clear. This is not a technical review. Its a review for the semi-professional telling about the simplicity of use. It doesn't come with a printed manual, however a local print shop can run that off for you with the disk supplied. The manual is very complete and large, and a user should thoroughly learn all aspects of this camera to adequately be able to take good pictures. Yes its easier to use the auto features, however using the special features makes the great shots. I've taken quite a few thousand pics since my purchase, and really found 10% that should be discarded, usually through a failing on my part. Its a great camera for amateur or professional alike. Just be ready to learn how to use it to its full capabilities. All in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, and it seems I take out my SLR, less.After using the camera for another month or two, the review still stands. I've  finally started using the high speed action scene mode and it functions as indicated. Have taken up to 10 pics a sec. and almost all are fine. At long zoom you have to be careful to be steady for a sec. even with the IS on. The camera focuses with the 1st pic.and then holds that focus. Most of my high speed shots have been panning shots. Have not tried objects coming to or going away from the photographer.Will do that soon.  Its very easy to go through your SD card quickly, so if you'll be out in the field for a while make sure you have extra SD cards or take a large one. 10 shots a second fills up a card fast, especially at fine setting with a 12 MP camera.""

Not quite a super pro camera, but for the non-pro, it does everything you'll ever need including very acceptable 1080HD video (not quite as good as my dedicated JVC camcorder), but a perfect alternative when a camcorder isn't available.

As an older person, I do not like the online version. I also wish that there should be no need for an adapter to add filters, which could be screwed into the camera directly. Anyway, I am hoping that this will turn out to be a good camera for me.""
"20120112","5.0","Shopping for it was sour, but this Canon is sweet","I am not a professional photographer. I am not even an amateur photographer. I just want really great family photos. Ones that I can crop and edit and still have a focused picture for my scrapbook when all is said and done. I think a DSLR is too much camera for me, but something that fits in my pocket isn't enough. What to do? Here's the chronological account of my hunt:1. Own Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR3.  Love it because:  - It does a decent job at capturing the moment - especially in sports mode (more equiv. to burst than sports).  - Takes decent video, although if you capture a still-shot from the video it is a little grainy.  - Portability. It is great to have a decent (i.e. not smartphone) camera in your purse at all times.  Wish it could:  - Take even higher res photos (because I always thought higher megapixels = higher quality photo, which I now know to only be partly true.)  - Zoom farther so I don't have to crop as much2. Panasonic has manufacturer defect that created dark spots on my photos. They send me a new one. New one is great, but eventually has same problem, now out of warranty. Disenchanted with Panasonic quality, I decide to look at other options.3. I see a Nikon flyer and drool at the V1 & P500. Ashton Kutcher sucks me in, and I'm poised for a Nikon b/c it seems sexy and hip. (Score one for marketing, negative point for stupid girl sucked in by such things. I don't even like Ashton Kutcher, I just like the marketing. Isn't that so sad. But, I digress...) Check snapsort.com, read reviews, and visit local photo shop. V1 is out of my price range, and I am liking the specs on the P500 - check out taht zoom! We compare to Canon T3 DSLR. I had trouble deciding between the super-zoom digicam and DSLR, but settle in the end on the P500. I walk out with the Nikon, a little uneasy about the choice, but excited that I have a Nikon, feeling all, 'I've got a cool camera!' happy. I do not open it or play with it as I am under strict orders that it must wait until Christmas. And, I love my husband, so I wait. Man, I hope I made the right choice!4. It is now Christmas morning - the moment I've been waiting for! I unwrap the package and take out my new sexy, hip Nikon to begin taking shots of our family gathering and my especially adorable niece. Love her! Anyway, I snap away on the standard settings with no flash (I think one day I read a blog that said try without, and I liked it and stuck with it.) As I look at what I've shot so far, many are very blurry! I fiddle with the settings, ensure the image stabilization is on, etc. Yep. All is well, and this should be shooting decent photos. I decide to shoot a few with flash open. Well, there is marked improvement for sure, but it took forever to focus. All morning I'd fiddle and snap, fiddle and snap. And, the more I used it the more I didn't like it. My photos were blurry, but what was perfectly clear is that I was duped by marketing. I do NOT love this camera. Tear. I shoot the rest of the day in video mode.5. I resolved to head back to the photo shop. I knew one of two things: there was something wrong with the camera or there was something wrong with me. Either way, I needed a solution. I expected to hear something like, 'You just don't know what you're doing...' but I didn't. They were even able to reproduce the same effect in the store. I showed them my pictures, and they looked at the settings, unable to see why it was shooting that way. In the end, they just said they thought it was working an awful lot to make all the adjustments. I decided I wouldn't be happy with it and had better try something else. I assumed my only other choice was to upgrade and move into the DSLR, and so we started looking at the T3. I just didn't want to spend that much, that's all. I know, it has all these great things about it and it can grow with me, blah blah blah. But I do not want to be a photographer. I just want good family photos, and is it worth spending $650 (a package with two lenses) for some decent scrapbook photos? I'm thinking maybe we should just go back to the little Panasonic. It was a good little camera, after all. But, I figure I can anti up, so 'I'll take it.' comes out of my mouth. As fate would have it, they were out of stock. So they order one and I prepare to leave.6. At home, I give it a last ditch effort. My husband asks, 'So, tell me again - what's the advantage of the DSLR??' and I say, 'Well, we gan grow with it and get add'l lenses, etc. To which he replies, 'Are we going to get new lenses?' And I realize: I don't want the DSLR. It's more camera than I need, but especially more camera than I want. I don't want a big bulky thing. I want big zoom in a little package. I go to Sam's Club for groceries, now completely unsure of myself in this camera escapade. I walk in a spy the Canon & Nikons on display right near the front. Nothing like salt on the wound! But, then I spot it: the Canon SX40 HS. Hey - that's just like the Nikon P500, but Canon. Why didn't they show me that at the photo shop? (Side note: I decided at this point that my suspicions were correct: my local shop offered me nothing more than I could get online. In fact, I got BETTER info online than in the store.) I called the shop from right there at Sam's. 'Oh, I didn't think of that!' he says. (Seriously, I have a Nikon P500 I like the idea of, but it isn't performing, and you don't think to show me the Canon counterpart? What a joke.)7. Back to the photo store to check out the SX40. (B/c of the return policy I have to shop there. Otherwise, I wouldn't.) As I play with it, I feel the 'Canon-ness' of it. You know. Canon just has a feel about it. It even sounds like a Canon. I think this may just be it. I decide I am not going to be an amateur photographer, I just want family photos, dang it! I am not going to buy a big DSLR, I am getting the SX 40. We make the Nikon-Canon swap and I head home with the Canon SX40 HS.8. I LOVE THIS CAMERA! The zoom is UNBELIEVABLE! The photos are crisp, and clear - no blur! The high-speed burst just spits 'em out! Hoorah! It just feels right! I took photos in low light last night, and in snow cover today. I just know that this will be a great camera for upgraded general-use. I don't care about the ISO limitation others complain about. I am not taking time lapse photos as night, and generally don't take photos at night, anyway. I don't care about 'full' manual control b/c I don't know enough about ISO or shutter speed to change it, anyway. And, I don't have the time to learn right now. The built-in setting on this camera will be perfectly fine for what I want, and I am SO glad we chose this. It's hard not to feel like to you have an inferior product, since it isn't a DSLR, but this product is more than what we need. It is superior to average point & shoot. It is a SUPER zoom.So, if you are just looking for a really great camera, with good solid specs that will take good overall photos, then look no further - and don't visit your local photo shop. Just do your research online, read the reviews, use snapsort.com to review the specs (ignore the Nikon P500) and click 'Add to Cart' on the Canon SX 40 HS. A great general-purpose camera for those thinking that a DSLR might be a bit too much camera, but want something better than what fits in a pocket.""
"20120108","3.0","Like this camera, however a few issues. Maybe someone can help","I bought this camera in November. I am happy with the zoom for sure. Not happy with indoor people shots. They are either yellow or pale. People's face color is either yellow or pale also. Distortion with sizes of surrounding things is not good either. When I want to crop, the cropped image is not crisp (all types of pics). I really thought this camera was going to be the bomb. I owned a SX210IS which took better pics than this for cropping and with indoor lighting. I have changed the settings to tungsten while shooting with fluorescent lighting. It got rid of the yellow, but looks flat and just not right. Can't put my finger on it. I do not know terribly much about settings. I do know that the SX210IS worked perfectly on auto, this one does not at all.""
"20120107","5.0","Za-za-za-Zoom Lens","I have had an SX-10 since it was introduced. I was very pleased with it. The zoom has helped me catch so many photos of wildlife that otherwise would be missed; it works well under so many settings. Up to now, I have not felt that the improvements on the SX-20 or SX-30 were sufficient to make me upgrade.  Why did I finally decide to upgrade?  The photos are stunning.  The color and clarity of the shots are very nice indeed!Of course, really  impressive is the mega-zoom lens, especially nice when I can't get as close as I want for one reason or another ... it really brings the subject to me. It's especially useful for wildlife and nature shots.  Battery life is good, and it is quite a bit faster than the SX-10 to start up and between shots.  The articulated screen is a real plus!  It enables you to take photos from all sorts of awkward, odd angles - even over your head - and still see your viewscreen clearly to compose your shot. Additionally, there is a pretty decent viewfinder for those times only a viewfinder will do. The camera's flash is adequate for typical uses (not at zoom...) and a standard external flash connection is built in, which is a real plus. Like the SX-10 it is a bit heavier and bulkier than other point and shoot cameras but it is surprisingly easy to hold, with a 'natural' handle built into the design. Menu and controls are similar enough to the SX-10 without being confusing or intimidating: actually I think if you've used any Canon PowerShot, they will look familiar.I have yet to play with the many features;  I do know after a short period of time with the SX-40 that it's a great specialty camera, an exceptional value for what it can do, it can't be beat - I love this camera.  I am looking forward to continuing to grow in knowledge of photography through use of this camera.""

"20120103","4.0","Might be last camera I buy.","I purchased this camera after trying a Kodak 10MP 12X zoom which I didnt review very well. It had a lot of issues mostly distortion, color quality & resetting things after changing battery.  Mostly color quality.I still needed the optical zoom of the SX40 HS. I am very pleased with almost eeverything I have tried to do with this camera. A little disappointed with it's being a little too smart about choosing what object I want to focus on.  I guess its the face recognition looking for a face when there is no face with a body on it.  I did zoom in on a neighbors pump about 500 feet away and it focused on the electrical junction box mounted on it's top considering it to be a person's head.I haven't had it long enough to check out all of it's capabilities but color quality, zoom, very little optical distortion and low light capabilities are all very good.I go after birds, beautiful sunsets and flowers mostly. Haven't had the right conditions for sunsets/sunrises this winter which is the best time and spring is just around the corner for the flowers.I didn't mention that I also own an older Canon 4X zoom which had excellent picture quality and color but didn't measure up for what I needed for optical zoom. I did read some reviews on the SX40 and my experience with the older Canon made me choose this one.  Not to forget that Amazon matched any price I could get elsewhere with no shipping and no sales tax.  I could better afford it. Thanks Amazon! 2Ecurious.""
"20111231","4.0","Beautiful camera!","Just purchased this new Canon and it is everything that I expected and more, except for one problem which I am wondering if might be just a defect in this one camera. Will get to that in a minute. I am a long-time user of the Canon mega zooms and this sx40 is replacing my sx10is which I have been completely satisfied with, and still am. The longer zoom range on the new sx40 pushed me to the upgrade, otherwise I would not be replacing my older model Canon. There are some differences between these models, some good and some not so much. I think the viewfinder was bigger and brighter on the sx10, and that does matter to me as I use the VF exclusively when shooting. The new model is also noticeably lighter, probably because of the battery difference, a good thing for one who spends many hours out in the field. The other reviewers have covered the differences, pros and cons, very thoroughly so I won't go into any more of that here.The problem that I'm having with this camera is a sort of grinding or chugging sound of an internal motor when aiming the camera or moving between subjects/lighting. I think it might be the auto exposure adjustment. I do not have the camera set for continuous autofocus or continuous image stabilization, so I don't think that's the issue. The sound is not real loud, but it is very noticeable and quite annoying. My sx10 makes a slight (similar, but quieter) noise when the auto focus is working its magic, but that is brief and it only occurs when I engage AF when ready to shoot. The sx40 seems to do this almost constantly while the lens cap is off, and not just while shooting. Is this normal for this camera? I am just about to start the return process because the constant sound is that annoying to me. I've read all through the manual, that eye-frying CD pdf thing on the computer screen, and so far have not found if there is a way to make this stop. If this is typical of all of the sx40s, then it is something to be aware of. For me, I'd have shopped for a quieter model or even a different brand if necessary. I realize that all of the digital cameras including DSLRs make some mechanical sounds, but this seems like too much and too constant. There was never any issue with the sx10 at all.Might increase the rating as this problem resolves, because this camera otherwise deserves more than three stars.Update: Jan. 1, 2012:Thanks so much to the Amazon community for the comments and feedback on their own sx40s! I now know that others do not have this issue, so this particular camera is probably defective. I have revised my rating to four stars. I would easily give this camera five stars without any hesitation....except for that small viewfinder! It is a step down from the bigger, brighter viewfinder on the previous models, so minus one star.""
"20111231","5.0","love the zoom","i take pictures using a tripod and need a very long zoom.  i do not want to cary around many different lenses and pay such high prices for them as well.  this camera is great for having a point and shoot with all the great features of dslr.""
"20111231","5.0","Great step up from a little pocket camera.","Great step up from a pocket camera without going to SLR. I still have much to learn, but very nice photos so far, and its a great looking camera. Very happy with my decision, and I did a fair amount of research on comparable models.""
"20111231","5.0","Canon SX40 HS","Have to admit, I am not a pro photographer but have used all brands, canon, nikon, yashica, olympus spanning over 25 years...Before I bought this camera, I had bought a Nikon P500, about 2 weeks ago.While using the P500, i noticed the following:1. At full 36x zoom, it's almost impossible to use the camera without a tripod. The stabilization is so poor that I just gave up taking shots without a tripod. Even then sometimes, the picture would be not very sharp.2. When using the HD movie recording mode, you cannot zoom in and out without losing clarity.3. While using the movie mode, you can hear the zoom motor in the recording. It's not bad when there is other noise in the recording but if silent then you can clearly hear the zoom motor at work.4. In low light conditions, the Nikon did not perform well. Especially if you try to take a shot without using the flash. Sometimes with the flash, the pictures were too bright.Frustrated, I started looking for 'superzoom' cameras which offer the same optical zoom. After intensive research, i settled on 2, the Canon SX40 HS and the Panasonic Lumix FZ150. Although the Panasonic has got higher marks by the pro's, I selected the Canon due to the lower price and my overall experience with the Canon name.Glad, I selected the Canon. This is a awesome camera. The image stabilization is so good, i don't need the tripod when using the max 35x zoom. I can take superb pictures without having to carry around a tripod. Indoor pictures, especially in low light is staggering. The difference between the P500 and the Canon is like heaven and earth.I also love the continuous mode, where i can take pictures of my kids and family without having them to stand still...In short, I love this Canon and highly recommend it to anyone looking a superzoom""
"20111229","3.0","Great camera.. but the battery?? AHHH!","per the instructions the battery has to be taken out after every use. the manual says to not let the camera sit with the battery in it, as it will 'leak'. WHAT?? I am really disppointed in that feature, because this camera just got 'un-quick' to use. that is VERY disappointing and I kind-of wish i would have gotten a camera that uses AA batteries. this one does not. DARN!""
"20111229","4.0","So far, so good.....","First, let me tell you I am a housewife, not a 'pro'.  I love to take fotos and will use the camera for family shots, vacations, and memorie making. I shopped for a 'bridge' camera for 6 months!  The main items I was looking for were  a long zoom, a viewfinder, and ability to attach a filter.  I researched and debated between this camera and the Sony DSC-HX100.  My last 2 cameras were Sonys and I had been happy, but decided to be open minded and do the research.  I wanted a step up from the pocket models but did not want to go back to dealing with carrying and changing lens'. In the end, the reason I chose this camera over the Sony was #1 cost, I could not see paying an extra $75 for the Sony , and the accessories were also more costly and #2, years ago I had a Canon AE1-and was happy with it, and well, Canon makes cameras-so I deceded to give it a try and go back to Canon.  I was happy I did.I took the camera with us on a cruise, and well, so far so very happy!!  Downloading the 200+ pages of the owners manual was a headache, wish they had included one, but you will need it!!  I have not even begun to 'touch' on what this camera is capable of doing and did not do any movies.  But, here are the points I have been happy with / and or not so happy with;-It is a little heavy, from what I am used to, and I am not yet comfortable with the 'grip' .  My hand keeps 'bumping' the knobs and 'things' happen-the night setting (in the SCN) works fantastic...with no flash, the low lighting works great-good image stabilization, not too many blurry fotos-the macro has been hard for me to 'figure out', but like I said, the manual is huge...so I have not yet been comfortable and happy with the macro fotos I have taken of flowers-the SPORTS setting for movement, appears to go slower than my Sony used to.  When you hold the button down, there seems to be a bit fo a lag-the flash is not strong.  I do like that you must manually raise or lowere, because I loke to be in control.  I may look at adding an external flash in the future...which you can do on this camera-I played with the color settings, as in b/w, sepia, vivid, etc.  these setting worked really well-I bought the filter adapter--do this!  Especially, if you plan on  beaqch scens, being able to attach a ppolarizing filter is a 'must'.  the adpater attached easily, once you took a minute to learn to do it correctly.  The negative is that the lens cap does not fit on with the adapter-'Trimming' works well in blowing up just a face in a foto...I have not played with any of the computer accesories yet, but within the camera, I am happyOverall, in the end, I am happy with the camera.  I am saying 'wow' more than I am saying 'I regret'....Value for price paid-very good.  Amazon and the other sellers I bought from, performedf and delivered as they said.  I did purchase the Amazon company warranty, but hopefully will not have the need to review it!!  Have fun shopping and hope my insights have helped...everyone leses that I read di help me make the final decision.""
"20111228","5.0","Very Good  Camera","I am a casual photographer who never sets aperture/shutter settings. For me most of the picture were taken in auto mode or scene select mode.I got  Excellent Results.Very good low light snaps in scene mode and also A++ snaps in Beach mode/landscape mode. My partner was able to stand on beach and take my picture snorkeling like 100 yards inside the sea from there and it looks like snaps were taken from 6 feet away. Zoom is very useful ; get this point and shoot if you can spend 175 dollars more than entry level point and shoot; it is worth it. Battery life is also good ; but do get yourself a spare one for vacation/travel. I think I got better pictures than my fellow traveler canon Rebel DSLR; he spent lots of time in setting up for pictures too.""
"20111227","4.0","Canon SX40 HS from Amazon.","I have waited for a good while for this camera. My last PowerShot was the SX10IS. I took a lot of pictures with the 10 and was quite happy with it. I didnt see much improvement in the model 20 or 30 so I waited. What I was looking for was better video and the 40 has HD video.The 40 uses 67mm filters and if you use filters you will have to buy a lens hood that screws to the filters. Unlike the earlier models, the 40 does not come with a lens hood and I assume it's because of that.As with the previous versions of this camera, Canon had not yet decided to give this model PowerShot RAW capability. Maybe someday. But I will use the 40 till they decide to add RAW. Then I'll probably upgrade again.""
"20111226","5.0","I love this camera","This camera is simply outstanding for a fixed lens digital. Best I've owned and it's my 5th Canon. It takes sharp, well balanced pictures in all kinds of lighting. The lens is 2.7f and 35X, equivalent to 24mm-840mm, and seems to have sharp focus over that range. I've always been intimidated by changing lenses on a DSLR, and this camera's lens range covers a multitude of DSLR lenses, at much lower cost.  It accepts a hotshoe flash and an adapter for filters and lens hood.  Start up to first photo is fast (~0.5sec), even with flash. It has settings for both auto exposure and auto focus bracketing, and panorama stitch assist.  The battery seems to take a lot of pictures per charge. I've taken 123 so far, about 1/2 w/flash and the battery indicator hasn't decreased. HD movies are excellent. This is the same size as a compact DSLR, so it's not a pocket camera. (That's why I still use my SX110.) Get yourself a roomy carry case. Only minor drawback for this intermediate amateur is no camera raw file format.""
"20111226","4.0","Significantly better than SX30IS; still room for improvements","Update: January 2, 2012The more and more I play with this camera the less I use the 50D.  Sure, there is no substitute for RAW and greater flexibility/creativity that the 50D offers; however, I love carrying one camera that meets 95% of my needs with decent photo quality.  The holidays offered me many chances to play with the camera and I continue to be impressed.I was surprised that Auto Exposure Bracket (AEB) works fairly well.  The delay between shots are about a second each.  Of course, this isn't ideal for moving subjects; however, it is great for fixed objects.  I also like the fact that a timer can be used to eliminate camera shaking and photo alignment for HDRI processing.  Also, the first shot is exposed in the middle of the AEB range making this mode somewhat usable for moving subject with fixed tripod shooting.The DIGIC 5 processor really seems to have significantly better Auto shooting mode.  I now find myself using Auto over P mode for most of my shooting.  This is especially ideal for handing the camera over to others to shoot the photographer...with pretty nice results.The built in flash along with better light sensitivity from the CMOS sensor (along with other improvements in the HS system) yields really nice indoor photos.The video mode is also quite useful; however, it won't replace my Panasonic HD camcorder.  The motor noise is especially noticeable in quiet environments and the lack of audio input eliminates any possibility of overcoming this problem.  Also, it is not natural to shoot videos while grasping the camera like, well, a camera.  The slow motion video; however, is fantastic.  I'm really thrilled to have 240 fps (320x240 pixels) capability to shoot the kids skateboarding...there is a lot going on during an Ollie.  I also like the ability to reduce fps to get better video (120 fps with 640x480).Canon put a lot of capabilities in a small package.  I'm sure this camera will be getting quite a work out...that's a great thing!==================================Original review: December 26, 2011You can read my 2 star rating for the SX30IS that I purchased a year ago to get a rundown on 6 issues I had with that camera.  SX40HS solves 2 issues fully and partially addresses one of them (shoots 1080p; CMOS for better low light; response time is better but not stellar).  These improvements on what appears to be virtually identical camera make this camera superior to all other super-zoom cameras.  Further, I've started to note some improvements in 'Auto' mode's ability to properly identify the scenery and make proper adjustments.  With the SX30IS I couldn't trust 'Auto' to do the job properly.  Having said this, I'll probably continue shooting primarily in 'P' mode; but, it is good to note that 'Auto' seems to work as promised.The CMOS sensor (and a step down in resolution) seems to produce far better indoor shots with much less noise.  As others have stated already, I'd love to see RAW capability in this camera; however, I fully understand the niche that this camera is to fill.  RAW would make this camera a perfect companion for my Canon 50D.The 35x zoom seems to have received some additional stability controls.  I've posted couple of photos to demonstrate how sharp the images are at maximum zoom range (see photos of 'Iron Mountain' with a horseback rider).  I shot these photos at more that quarter mile away and, to my amazement, I was able to read the writing on the saddle!  Other shots I've taken from a great distance revealed details that floored me.  The SX30IS had more blur and noise at 35x zoom; thus, Canon added improvements that make the 35x zoom very usable.  Of course, issues like barrel distortion and such will force you to spend some time fixing the images.After my bad experience with the SX30IS, I took a chance on this camera and found that it meets my expectations and makes up for most of the issues I've had with the SX30IS.  You'll note from my review of that camera that the SX30IS is only one of 2 Canon cameras that disappointed me; SX40HS is a winner!""

Good photos that are heads above the camera phone or little digital, great zoom, ease of use - soooo happy!!!!!""
"20111223","1.0","Major Design Flaw","This camera has a major design flaw.  The front of the lens is threaded for what appears to be 52mm threaded accessories.  However the thread is not a standard pitch and 52mm accessories such as filters and lens shades will not attach.  Canon does make a filter adapter that bayonets on the outside of the lens but it requires you to use a 67mm filter.  This makes the lens cap useless and destroys the relatively compact lines of the camera.  In addition when the filter adapter is mounted you cannot use the lens shade.  When I called Canon about this they told me this was a simple point and shoot camera so they didn't think it was important to be able to mount a filter and lens shade together.  Oddly Canon describes this as a 'High End Advanced Digital Camera' on their website.  This IS an advanced 'bridge' camera designed for advanced amateurs and pros.  When I posted this review on Canon's sight they sent me an e-mail stating they were deleting my review.  I guess they can't handle the truth.  When I asked Canon what the front threads were for they stated they were auxiliary lenses even though Canon doesn't make any for this camera.  Third-party lenses are all designed for standard 52mm thread pitch and with a focal length range of 24mm to  840mm, what else would you need?""
"20111222","4.0","Good Improvement-but-","Worth the price of upgrade from the SX30.  Except for the new software and the new sensor basically same camera as the SX 30.  Better pictures than before-still no RAW but that's available with a CHDK hack.  Now for the but.  No reason that this camera is slower that almost all of the other ultra zooms.  I can't believe that Canon isn't able to at least tie the others in this area.  No reason for not upgrading the viewfinder and LCD monitor, everyone else has. Still a great lens.""

As with any new camera, employing a little time and patience to learn which settings produce the best results given the available amount of light will allow this camera to consistently deliver pleasing results. I've posted some photos here that are straight out of the box, hand-held, with no internal sharpening or custom colors, and no external filters or post processing of any kind.

I upgraded from the Canon PowerShot SX10 IS to this one and I've been thrilled with some of the new features and less than thrilled with others.The quick verdict:This is a great camera for anyone who wants lots of features and versatility but doesn't want to use manual settings and doesn't travel a lot.Pros: great zoom range, nice picture and video quality, improved low light performanceCons: ISO locked to 100 with >1 second exposures, proprietary Li-ion batteryHandling:The camera is a bit bulky, as you would expect from a camera with a 35x zoom lens, but I quickly got the hang of handling it. I tend to accidentally hit the zoom framing assist button when shooting. It seems to be right where my thumb wants to be when holding the camera, especially when switching between landscape and portrait orientation. I had similar issues with the SX10. I'm not sure I like the memory card being slotted in with the battery on the bottom of the camera. Access to the battery/card slot is blocked when attaching the camera to a tripod quick release plate.Zoom capabilities:The zoom range is a nice feature. The size of the full moon is about 1/5th along the long side of the image at full optical zoom and close to 850 pixels across. On a clear night, you can get some nice detail. Clipping the Raynox DCR-250 macro conversion lens on at full zoom and using a light box for trans-illumination, I was also able to take pictures of microscope slides at 125x total magnification on a 150 dpi test print. They look better than the images I took with a scope and CCD camera at the lab. Very nice!Image quality and low light performance:The image quality under low light and high ISO conditions has improved compared to the SX10. I took some images of kittens at the shelter in rooms that were poorly lit. With the SX10, I would end up with a lot of motion blur and noise on high ISO (800) images. Comparable images look better with the SX40, but some processing artifacts are visible when looking at the full size of the high ISO (1600) images. The camera ultimately was not able to stop the motion of kittens at play without the use of flash though, but I was expecting that under the poor light conditions.External flash:Speaking of flash, the camera works well with the SpeedLite 270EX flash. The hot shoe can be covered with a plastic cap for protection when not in use. It took me a few tries to figure out the best way to take the cap off, but with a closer look at the design once you get it off it becomes obvious. Having long enough fingernails to get under and lift the front of the cap makes it easier.Filters and lens accessories:The lens can be fitted with the same 58 mm Lensmate filter adapter as the SX10. Thin filters will work fine at all zoom settings, but thicker filters like a circular polarizer or stacking several filters will cause vignetting at wide angle. A little bit of zoom or a 67 mm filter adapter may help avoid the vignetting issue. The lens cap that comes with the camera will no longer fit once you put the filter adapter on. And speaking of the lens cap - Canon put a tether on it, so it can be attached to the camera thus reducing the risk of losing it compared to the non-tethered cap of the SX10. While that is a plus, the SX40 does not come with a lens hood like the SX10 did. That would need to be purchased separately.Settings:One thing I miss on the SX40 is the 'sunset' preset under the SCN options that the SX10 offered. Out of all the SCN options on the SX10, that one probably saw the most use when I wasn't in M or Av mode, so I'll have to figure out an equivalent setting on the SX40. The snow, beach, and foliage settings are all still there, so why did the sunset disappear? The new settings such as miniature seem intriguing, but I haven't really gotten into exploring that yet.Overall, the camera has a lot of good features. So why would I give it only three stars? There are at least two things that I would consider design flaws.Battery:Let's start with the battery. This is a so-so issue, some good news and some bad news. The good news is the battery weighs less than the SX10's AA batteries, lasts longer (for about 1000 pictures), and fully recharges in under 2 hours while I often have to let the AAs recharge over night. The bad news is it is much more expensive to get a spare and inconvenient for travel. With the SX10, I could fly overseas and use my mom's batteries and charger in Germany in case I forgot to bring mine. If needed, I could rely on AA batteries being available at a souvenir shop or gas station. With the proprietary battery pack, if I forget to take the charger and 220V adapter with me or don't have anywhere to plug it in, the camera is dead once its battery pack runs out of power. You can't just buy a spare one at a gas station. If you have a spare battery pack in your possession, you have to package it according to TSA safety restrictions on Lithium batteries if you take it on an airplane. So there's a lot more to consider when traveling with this camera. If Canon offered the same camera with the option of using AA batteries, I would probably opt for that instead of the battery pack just for the sake of convenience when traveling.'Manual' mode limitations:The bigger issue though is that the camera does not have a fully manual mode. Sure, there is the M mode setting, but it has limitations. I noticed it when I took some night shots and the camera changed my ISO setting from 400 to 100 as I increased exposure time in M mode. When I tried to reset the ISO, it told me 'ISO speed is limited due to slow shutter speed.' The camera manual explains under Tv mode that when shutter speeds of 1.3 seconds or slower are used, the ISO speed is fixed to ISO 100. However, there is no warning about it on the page detailing M mode and I did not expect to find any limits in manual setting as it wouldn't really be manual then.I emailed Canon support about it and they clearly did not get what I was asking about, so I called phone support. The guy I talked to was clearly not expecting this limitation either and at first told me I probably had a faulty camera and should send it in. However, he was then able to reproduce the effect on his camera much to his own surprise. He had to check with someone and finally came back with the information that the limitation is built into the firmware by design to 'prevent overexposure and hot pixels on the sensor.' No plans to upgrade the firmware to change that. He recommended cranking up the ISO to 3200 at 1 second exposure. That's not really what I wanted to do though. It's a bit of a joke really, or even insulting, to any photographer who knows what they're doing in M mode.It is possible to get around this limitation using a CHDK hack. However, at this time there is only a buggy alpha version of CHDK available for the SX40. I gave it a try and while the ISO override worked, it wasn't the ISO I had set it for. E.g. setting the override at ISO 400 gave me pictures with ISO 640, and setting it for ISO 800 gave me ISO 1250. Regardless of the option of using CHDK, this limitation is like putting a child lock on M mode and it's a farce to call the resulting feature 'manual mode.' So that is my main disappointment with this camera so far.Instructions:Last but not least, I was also disappointed that Canon does not provide a printed manual with the camera. All you get is a PDF on the accompanying CD. It is set to print in postcard size, which results in a lot of white space and waste of paper when printing it. The resulting binder weighs more than a pound in paper weight. Neither the PDF nor the print out are useful as a reference in the field, at least not for me. The tech support person I talked to quickly promised to get a printed manual sent to me at no charge when I mentioned it though, so a phone call might be all it takes to get one. I haven't received it yet, but when I do I shall report what it looks like.The verdict:Overall, the SX40 is a nice camera with some great features, but unfortunately it is prevented from performing to its full potential by restrictions that Canon designed into the firmware. Canon's 'design' of locking ISO settings in manual mode is almost an insult to more advanced hobby photographers, and it is clearly misleading to still call it 'manual' if the camera is allowed to override the photographer's choices in settings. I don't think any other camera model in this quality and price class does that. However, those who do not use M mode routinely will probably hardly notice this limitation.""
"20111217","1.0","Uses Proprietary Battery Instead of AAs","The main reason I will not upgrade from my SX10 IS to this one is the same reason I didn't upgrade to the SX30 IS: Canon's poor decision to use a proprietary battery instead of AAs like the SX10 IS does. If I were to get this camera, I would have to spend more for extra batteries, have to lug around more spare batteries, and deal with having to keep up with and lug around another battery charger or two. I make it a point to avoid electronic equipment that uses anything other that AAs and AAAs to minimize the number of spare batteries and battery chargers I need to have. Until Canon goes back to using AAs, they have lost me. Also, Canon has limited some of the manual settings that weren't limited before. If I want something automatic, I'll use the Auto settings. Otherwise, please let me make my own decisions on what manual settings to use.""

I bought this just before the thanksgving weekend and in two days time I went for a chicago trip. The camera helped me to capture Chicago very well and definitely put the 35X to full use. The range of shots that can be taken increases dramatically with 35X and I end up spending lot of time to capture most of them, It was indeed very fun! The video recording for this cam is very good and it works very well even in low light conditions.I have recommened this cam to couple of my friends and so far they are also very happy with it. You will never go wrong with Canon SX 40 HS.""
"20111213","4.0","Great for the price","I am an average picture taker and for the price this is a good solution.  The pictures are very clear and beautiful.I'd like to see a little more color enhancement though for more vibrant colors.  There may be a setting for this but I haven'tfound it yet.""
"20111212","5.0","Great camera!!!!!!!!!!","I purchased this camera for my girlfriend to replace an older kodak. We are purely amateurs but this camera makes us look like pros. I was skeptical when i was looking at the sample pictures this camera took of the moon. They looked photo shopped or something. I walked out on a clear night and snapped a shot with no tripod and sure enough, it came out beautifully. I was blown away at the details that you can see at full zoom. The slow motion camera is a huge plus as it allows for everyday events that normally seem boring, to be slowed down into an epic show every single time. For video, you must have very good lighting and it will come out crystal clear. This was basically the first camera i ever picked up and i learned how to use all the features in a couple days. Its extremely user friendly and they have very good user guides online to answer any questions you may have. Overall, from an amateurs standpoint, this camera is amazing. When I show my pictures to friends and family, they all are genuinely shocked and impressed. I could go on and on about how great this thing is. From battery life to quality of picture, this camera is the total package. Don't hesitate if youre comparing this to other cameras. They can't beat the price and the features. The Canon SX40HS is the most bang for your buck.""
"20111211","3.0","My first look  and impression of the Canon SX 40","My first look at handeling this Canon SX 40 was a disappointment.  The grip on the right front was shallow for my finger grasp and I don't have large hands. The top of the grip should have had a more pronounced finger stop. It had only a shallow one. The grip surface didn't have a sure grip rubber feel like Nikon and other cameras of similer value.  I felt it could easily dropped at any time. The electronic viewer was indeed, too small and I just didn't think the overall look of the camera, was as snazzy as the Nikon sitting next to it.  It of course takes great photo's and while that is a must,  I really have to fall in love with the look and feel of a camera. I will keep my eye on this for future upgrades.""
"20111211","4.0","This Camera Rocks!","Took a trip specifically to take photos.  I planned on using both my Canon SX40HS and my Canon EOS60D professional DSLR.  I wanted to compare like photos between the two.  I compared quality of the picture as well as the convenience and ease of using them.  I found that the Canon SX40HS was not only easier and quicker to use, but captured the subject as perfectly as the 60D and the zoom on this camera was phenomenal.  The versatility of the SX40HS is awesome.  It gives the user more options with far less equipment to haul around, not to mention cost savings.  I was surprised and pleased with the quality of the photos when I was finally able to view and process the photos.  I would strongly recommend this camera to anyone planning on purchasing a new DSLR.""

"20111207","5.0","Canon SX40HS","Package arrived on time as promised.  First imprressions of the Canon are very positive as compared to my Lumix FZ28.  Better wide angle, very important, and much longer telephoto.  The most important however is the sensor being able to shoot in low light as I hate flash pictures.  I would rater use a tripod and shoot time lapse than use flash.  Controls are better placed than my Lumix.  Prior to the Lumix I had a Conon ultra zoom(earlier model) and a EOS Rebel (too much 'stuff' to carry with 4 lenses. I did order through Amazon a non Canon lens hood and filters from Bower with adapter.  Everything fit EXCEPT you can not use the lens hood with a filter.  Oh well.........By the way when you purchase an extra battery go to BHPHOTO.COM and buy #PONB10L which is 1200MAh(Canon is 850MAh) for $14.77 and free shiping.""

I like the Canon wide angle/35X zoom with the same lens. Just what I was looking for.  More advanced then my old Powershot 2.""
"20111203","4.0","Preliminary G9 Comparison","A big vacation is coming up, so it seemed like time for a new camera.  I wanted the longer zoom, 1080p movie capability, and better low light sensitivity that Canon advertises for the SX40.  I picked the camera up at Wal-mart last night since they had them for $379 and I just purchased my accessories through Amazon.  I'm trying to decide whether to gift my G9 to my daughter and did a quick comparison between the G9 and SX40.  I took pics in the back yard this morning at the zoom extents of the G9 and tried to match their field of view with the SX40 zoom position; I then took extra pics with the SX40 at it's full zoom extents.Okay, this thing takes good pictures, but the first thing I noticed was the size of the JPG was roughly half of the G9.  I knew the RAW support was absent on the SX40, but I wasn't expecting the JPG quality would also be limited; in Canon terms it has a 'fine' but no 'superfine' JPG setting.  There are some obvious changes in the image processing on the DIGIC chip (G9=III, SX40=5), generally for the good, but in one case it removed some fine detail, that while pleasing in the image, differed from what was actually there.  It's possible a different mode or turning off image stabalization wouldn't have done this.  Overall I am pleased because I knew mostly what not to expect in advance, and it's quite impressive seeing ants and plant fuzz when zoomed on grass that is 20 feet away... something that required close-up mode previously.  Since the vacation will offer sweeping landscapes and the opportunity of animals at a distance, it will do what I want it to do.First impression of the mechanism was that it looks good, but feels somehow partly-filled when compared to the metal G9 with everything in a smaller and denser body... this is obviously true as the lens portion is mostly empty space; from a shooting perspective weight is sufficient for stability and it fits good in the hand.  The variable-speed zoom actuator is noisy and not too smooth, which for stills in okay, but a big negative for video.  There is no external microphone jack to get away from the sound when shooting video, but as suggested by Canon themselves, set your zoom before shooting video.Some comments about the Canon camera's and my thoughts on their technology rollout.  The G9 is a 12.1 MPixel as is the SX40; so both shoot a maximum image size of 3000x4000 pixels.  The G series in the past was considered closer to the pro SLR models than the S/SX series, as many in the series offer raw mode and extensive manual capabilities.  I feel Canon has fallen down on the G however; the newer G series (at G12 now) have dropped their resolution to 10 MPix, which seems a big step backwards to me.  I looked at the the current SLR line, and the 5D Mark III is sweet, but I'm not ready to pay over $3200 to get camera body and lenses to approach the zoom range of the SX40.  The Rebel's and other sub 5D models are problematic since their CCD size adds a 1.6x multiplier to the lens attached to them.  Canon's tech is there to put a truly fantastic intrrument in any of their camera bodies, but they are always holding a few things back to guide pro-sumers toward the more expensive units.  For instance, this SX40 should have all the features of the G9 I purchased over 4 years ago; the capability is in the chip, just not brought out in the firmware.  When combined with the longer zoom range, Canon may have felt this would have encroached too much on their SLR line, but what they failed to understand is I would have paid more to get RAW, a non-'ISO'-limited long exposure time (mentioned extensively in another post), a smoother zoom operation, and an external mic jack.  If, as it seems they intend to limit their 'point and shoots' to 12MPix at the moment, then they should have 2 tiers of SLR at 18MPix and 24MPix and all with a 1x CCD size lens modifier.  Though, as much as I loved my old Canon A-1 film camera, lugging around various lenses is not something I miss, so there is that downside to moving 'up' to an SLR again; I would greatly appreciate the mentioned features in a point and shoot, but when it comes time for the next upgrade in another couple years, I'll want those plus 16 MPix or better.""
"20111130","3.0","Not as great as made out to be, disappointed, returned for FZ-150","Was very disappointed with the camera. Zoom was excellent, no doubt, but the 2.7' LCD was just crap, compared with other zooms makes the canon so inferior. The build was cheap plastic. I didn't care for the LCD initially, but trust me when you compare it with others..its a NO NO!!. Exchanged for the fz-150 (awaiting in mail). The only thing i didn't like about the panasonic was the ZOOM  (24X vs 35X), even though i am not sure i needed the extra zoom for now. Sony HX100v was another good option but decided on panasonic based on the glowing review. Lets see.Before buying, please head to the local BB and compare the cameras, I should have done that initially before purchasing the canon. I am sure the CANON is amazing in taking pics and quality, but the first impression always matters and compared to others, it just was not what i expected""
"20111130","5.0","Canon SX40 HS.. Great Camera","I Love this camera. I have been waiting a couple years for Canon to get it to this point. Now it is ready. Everything works Great. Great low light pictures, the Auto Focus works Great. The Movies come out Awesome. Great sound too. Fast recycle time. I have No Complaints. I Really Like this camera.""
"20111128","5.0","YES. I can see again...!!!!","I was so sick of having a 'good' camera capable of taking excellent quality pictures, but with an LCD screen that was often hardly visible due to sunlight or low light. Another negative was that this camera would not zoom while shooting video. So I traded it in for the Canon SX40 HS, which not only has a viewfinder, but also a diopter adjustment. I can now see clearly what I am shooting without wearing glasses. The Canon also zooms and refocuses nicely in video mode. Love at first sight, literally. I don't mind that the Canon won't fit in my pocket. It's still portable enough to take hiking, and the thrill of actually being able to compose pictures properly is compensation enough. Very good pictures, by the way.This camera has a lot of thoughtful little features that I wasn't expecting in a point-and-shoot. I'm not a sophisticated camera user so it was a pleasant surprise to find that the rotating LCD screen is useful when perching the camera on a window sill to shoot video, and the screen can also be rotated around to face inside to protect it when not in use. I'm inspired to get the most out of this camera so I am working my way through the full PDF version of the user guide. So far (after about 3 weeks) I'm delighted.""
"20111128","5.0","Great zoom, excellent results at high ISO settings.","This camera is the pinnacle of the Canon point and shoot ultrazooms.  Going from very wide angle (35mm equivalent of 24mm) to way long (840mm equivalent), it will take about any picture you have in mind including a simulated fish-eye mode.  The CMOS sensor is excellent at providing very low noise even at the highest ISO settings.  Colors are excellent and the auto white balance seems to work well.  One thing to note is that only the NB-10L battery will fit this camera.  Although mostly an upgrade from the SX30, changes include the use of a smaller battery than the SX30 uses.  The SX40 HS takes excellent HD video, but because I don't have a fast (class 6) memory card, I can only take HD video for about a minute before the camera has to stop and catch up with the data processing.  A faster SD card would cure this I'm sure.  The slow motion video is fun although the 240 fps setting is pretty low res.  The 120 fps uses 640 x 480 resolution which is better.One quibble is that there are too many buttons around where my right thumb goes and it's easy to push one inadvertently. Another point is that there is apparently no way to do time lapse movies.Aside from that, I really like this camera.""
"20111128","5.0","A great camera","I was originally planning to buy a Canon SX30IS but when I had the money to do so, the SX40HS had come out. I didn't think it twice and I bought the last one instead. I'm happy I did it. The picture quality is amazing and the zoom allows me to take pictures of the moon and its craters! The full HD video recording is also great, although it should be better used with a tripod by shaky hands.All in all, it's a great camera that could well start newbies in the world of photography. A really good choice.""
"20111127","4.0","WOW... Impressive!","I must thank Amazon for bringing the HX40 HS to the market before the time advertised for it's release. Delivery was within two days of it's schedule and customer service for this specific product was quite professional. This allowed me to take on my holiday (to England) a camera with specifications I've been longing for. I have owned other super- zooms but none have given me the image quality and handeling as the Canon SX40 HS. Where it lacks is in the poor resolution of it's lcd and viewfinder. The hand grip also need re-designing since it's too east for your finger to accidently toggle the zoom device. Regardless, I have no reservation in highly recommending this product.""

I searched around and did some product reviews and replaced my SX10 with the new SX40.  The pictures are even sharper than my original camera which I thought were great.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who doesn't feel like using an SLR.  I also own a Canon A1 and and AE1 that are not digital.  They just sit in the closet now.  I love my new camera and wished who ever stole my other one would just return my card.  My name was on it with my address.  I bought it direct from Amazon and the delivery was so fast and just as described.  Love Amazon""
"20111122","4.0","Actually, 5 stars if you need this zoom.","I don't. I want portability, not super zoom. So I bought an S95 and have used it the past year. Got this cam for the 10 percent of shots I thought I wasn't getting with the S95 and guess what? I'm still not getting them because the SX40 doesn't fit in my pocket.If I want to carry a bulky camera I'll haul out the T2i. A point and shoot should not be this big. Now, if you are only going to have one camera and you absolutely have to have the biggest zoom in a point and shoot...you've found it. This thing's a long-ranger. It gives you standard barrel distortion that Canon mostly removes via in-camera processing.Its controls are more frustrating than the S95. To get basic parameter changes I have to drill into menus. The S95 has enough tactile control to make adjustments faster for less fiddling when you want to be getting the shot. But it has a 'framing zoom only.' I like that. You may hate it. But if I see a distant subject I want to photograph, I GO OVER THERE. You will always get better detail than if you just point a long zoom at it. I realize there are shots I'm not going to get, particularly of wildlife or over water or from a distant lookout or whatever.But honestly that's not the kind of shot I pursue anyway. I like the funky stage-lit concert shot at House of Blues when I'm close enough to get a full-length lead singer portrait in mid-kick. The red barn against the blue sky. The inside of a candlelit rustic restaurant in the inn built in the 1700s. The S95, with its f/2.0 lens, flat out blows the SX40 into the weeds for the kind of color and light I love.I think I'll list my new SX40 on ebay and see how the new S100 is. I hear they put a built-in ND filter on this one. Same sensor as the SX40, faster lens. What's not to like?Yes, I'll still miss those superzoom shots. But since I don't take superzoom shots anyway, no loss for me. I gain it back tenfold in image quality, especially in low light. And best of all, the camera is always with me so when an interesting image presents itself, I have the tool to make the photograph right in my pocket.I have a G12 that's gathering dust as well. The S95 has the same sensor and processor and IMHO a better lens than the G12, and fits in a pocket.The SX40's party trick is that telescope they hung on it. If you must have that huge zoom, this is your camera. For me it introduces more shake than I can handle even with IS and I have to lock it on a tripod to get anything like a usable image at long range. The tradeoff is poor low light performance and less creative control of my shots, as well as all the bulk involved in lugging the Hubble around with me. I see why this camera is popular with shooters who dig that zoom, and for that it's awesome. If you are one of those then you know who you are. Bid on mine--you might get it for quite a bit less than Amazon is selling them for.""
"20111119","5.0","Upgrade Canon SX30 to SX40 hs","I am writing this review for others who currently own the Canon SX30 and are considering upgrading to the SX40hs.I believe this is a very worthwhile upgrade and addresses the three main flaws of the SX30.  The low light image quality has been markedly improved, as well as the color rendering.  The shot-to-shot time is now acceptably fast.Because of the improved low light performance, I now can leave the camera in auto-iso when shooting in P mode.  On the SX30 I never went beyond ISO 400.  I find that not having to adjust the ISO as frequently makes it less likely to miss shots.The only regret I have is that Canon changed the battery for the camera - so I can no longer use the extra battery I bought for the SX30  (Canon batteries are outrageously expensive in my opinion).I also own a Canon 60D with 55-250 zoom.  I had been using this camera for low light photos and when image quality was of paramount importance.  I believe the SX40hs now produces high enough quality photos for me to consider selling the 60D with lenses.All-in-all Canon has finally produced a superzoom that is close enough to an SLR to be completely satisfactory.  The versatility of this camera is unmatched.""
"20111117","5.0","The Camera I've Been Waiting For....","I've held off buying a digital camera, getting by with a simple point and shoot and a cell phone. The last time I took a serious look at digital cameras, there were two main kinds--point and shoots and DSLR. The point and shoot was 'okay' for snapshots. The DSLR was the one you'd get for image quality and control over all the elements of photography (thinking back to film camera days.../old).The point and shoots were functional, pocketable and simple. The DSLRs were sophisticated, complicated and heavy (lenses...you would want to have lenses....)  Oh, and DSLRs were really pricey, especially getting the lenses (the kits? Not such a good idea). I bought a point and shoot and always felt ...'eh...' about it. Not very exciting if you want to pursue photography as a hobby (as I used to do with my old 35mm Canon A-1, which I loved).So, imagine my surprise looking around here a month ago and finding there has been a sea change in the digital camera world. Not only have the prices gone down for everything--what an array of choices there are now in all categories!--but the technology, the capabilities of even so-called point and shoot cameras is now pretty amazing. And you get so much 'still camera' PLUS video, too.So...I narrowed down my choices and tried to decide: 'Canon T3i...or Canon s100?' Two different concepts, both very versatile, but one easy to slip in a pocket or purse, the other...feeling more like what I still think of as a 'real' camera--interchangeable lenses, hot shoe for the flash, RAW, and...with video..a nice capability to have an external mike.While I was thinking, I went over to [...] (Canon Talk) forum where they were discussing the same thing: What to get?And I saw images from the SX40 (which I'd never heard of --and just came out 2 months ago, so no reviews yet). Fantastic! And the zoom! 24mm so nice and wide. 840mm at the telephoto...amazing!  All compact and lightweight for what you got. A new genre called a 'superzoom' or 'bridge' camera coming between the point and shoot and the DSLRs. And actually costing LESS than the s100!!!After deliberating for a month between the s100 (which I'd ordered, but wasn't in yet) and the T3i, I had found 'my' camera. In less than 24 hours of finding it, I ordered.  And, really, it was love at first sight.There is so much that's great about this camera and Canon lays it all out well on this page. You get the idea--as much (or as little) creative control as you want. If you don't like to fiddle with controls, just put it on 'P' and you'll get great pix without doing anything except 'point and shoot' (well, and focus and stay still). But if you like to 'grow' with a camera, it has a menu button that is easy to scroll through, settings that are easy to use, a mode dial right on the back that makes everything easy to find, a 'record' button for video that is colored red so you can't miss it...couldn't be easier...or more fun!The only other things you might want to know are: it has a hot shoe, but doesn't shoot RAW (which I don't care about, but people who are heavily into post-processing are). There's no way to attach an external mike of your own, but the internal mike has two different settings and a wind filter--so, better that most, sound-wise. I put a 67mm lens adapter on to prevent vignetting and added a clear filter to protect the lens, that and a good memory card and a case and....good to go! I can't recommend this enough--it is a really fun camera (oh, and has macro as well) and using a long zoom like that is just really exciting if you like photography at all. (Check out the pics of the moon at dpreview. Amazing).  Highly recommended.""
"20111117","5.0","A Great Camera","This is a great camera. It might not be as good as a DSLR but it is pretty close and a lot less expensive and you don't have to carry around extra lenses. The photos I took in the Auto setting were clear and sharp. The 35X optical zoom is excellent but you have to have a steady hand or a tripod when you are all the way out. The HD video is very clear and sharp; I was very happy with this. The camera has a lot of features and functions and covers every aspect that you can think of. I am completely satisfied!""

This camera is perfect for someone who wants to upgrade from the pocket powershot type of digital camera, but isn't interested in a more advanced camera. I really didn't want a camera with all the different lenses, so this seems to fit my needs. Still learning all of the features, but so far I am pleased!""
"20111116","1.0","Happy until I found about ISO limitation","I recently bought this camera and I was really happy with it. The overall quality is good. You can take some nice pictures and videos. Now, Yesterday I was playing with it with the intention of taking some starry night shots. I was extremely disappointed to notice that with long shots (more that 1 second exposure time) you can't use a higher ISO than 100. I have no idea why is that, but I've read other reviews about this issue and it is real. You can google 'ISO speed is limited due to slow shutter speed'. This limitation is difficult to understand since older cameras didn't have it. This is clearly a deal breaker for me, since doesn't allow you take night pictures with the camera's full potential. It is incredible to believe that anyone can think it is a good idea to include such limitation in a camera that has a full manual mode.Canon, seriously???""

I brought the camera because it has many options, 35x optical zoom, HD movies, scenes, filters, etc.  The details in photos are amazing.  It's not an SLR but if you're looking for a great all around camera, that does nice video and produces great pictures, you can't go wrong with the Canon Powershot SX40 HS.  The improvements over it's predecessors are well worth buying this one.""
"20111114","5.0","Can't Be Happier Than This","I was thinking of buying a 70-300 IS lens for my Canon 60D but now that is off my list. The zoom quality and range is fantastic. Even my hand held shots at full zoom are great. some people are complaining about attaching filters on the lens. I could attach a 52mm UV filter on the lens. It was a bit tricky but it worked for me. Now I can attach all the filters over this UV filter.Wish if there would have been RAW format also in this camera.Only thing I did not like in body design is the cover over flash hot shoe. It is easy to loose it if you remove it to use external flash. Hey Canon, make a simple design so that there is no need of any cover. There are hundreds of models out there without cover. Hope I will enjoy it till there is a better one out there to lure me to buy that.""

It feels like something is loose and knocking around in this relatively large camera body.  Also, whether zoomed out or not, the IS seems uncertain as to whether I am panning or not, which I am not doing.  I guess I could turn it all off, but then I think, why am I paying for this if I just have to turn it off?""

"20111109","5.0","Love this camera!","My single reason for purchasing this camera was that my daughter received the SX30 for Christmas last year.  When I realized that model had been replaced by the SX40 I was a little concerned that it might be too difficult for me to operate.  After handling one in a store I decided this was the one for me! (I purchased my camera from Amazon and received it on the day they said, no shipping or tax added.)  The online guide is a little aggravating in that you can't carry it with you, but it is very easy to understand for a novice like me. (I did print out a few key pages which were very helpful to me.)  This camera is super easy to use, pictures and video are beautiful and I feel it is worth the price paid.  Before purchasing, I compared this camera with the Nikon Coolpix L120.  To me, this camera wins hands down!""
"20111109","5.0","Finally. This Is The Camera I Was Waiting For!","I've been wanting a megazoom camera for a couple of years. Each time I thought I had found 'the one' something in a review of the camera dissuaded me from buying it.I decided to take the plunge and bought the SX40 and I am sure glad that I did.The picture quality, even using the straight Auto setting, is amazing. The zoom capability is beyond anything I could have hoped for.One nice surprise was the inclusion of a hotshoe for a flash unit.I've been playing around with some of the special features (sport mode, burst shooting photo stitching) and have found them easy to work with.If there's one minor criticism I have it's the lack of a printed manual.""
"20111109","5.0","SX40","Had the SX30 and was disappointed with it sharpness and low light performance.  The SX40 has addressed both issues and I am very pleased with this camera.""
"20120601","5.0","Excellent compared to SX30IS","What an absolute jump in picture quality.  I found with the SX30IS (owned for a year) that I had to clean up virtually every picture with both the purple CA and the picture's noise level.  Not the case with the SX40HS.  The pictures look great when displayed on my monitor as background (wasn't always the case for the SX30IS).In my view, both the clarity of the pictures (overall) and coloring are much improved.I am not a profesional photographer, but I am very fussy about the end result.No doubt that a more expensive cameras that might take better pictures, but having the ability to zoom to these levels with a single camera, that is easy to carry around, makes this choice just excellent.  Out of the first 200 pictures I took, I only had about 10 that didn't focus properly.  This was a user error in not paying close attention to how clear the picture appears in the view finder before clicking.I also found that the 'Auto' function on the dial is much better on the SX40HS than on the SX30IS.  I had to use the 'P' setting exclusively on the SX30IS to assure getting most shots, whereas the 'Auto' setting on the SX40HS does a great job at setting the internal aperature, speed and ISO settings.The 'hand-held night shot' is Ok, but I seem to have better success with the 'Low light' setting.I'll be honest with you, I spent some time deciding if I really wanted to upgrade to the latest Canon SX40HS and trade-in my SX30IS, but, after having it for a week, it was an excellent decision.I really don't see any advantage, at least for my enjoyment of photography, to even think about another camera beyond the Canon SX40HS.As I gain more information on this camera, I'll add to my review.""

"20120530","5.0","perfect all-around camera!","I',ve purchased this camera through a friend who travelled to USA, Nex York, on march, this year. He passed on B&H store and got a SX40 Canon for me, with 32 SDHC high speed card and extra battery. Since it arrived in my hands, I took more than 1000 pictures, and can say that 90% are still stored on my computer. The 10 % were discharged due to blurr or some errors of myself, trying new capabilities of the camera. That is the learning and adapting process... I have another camera, a DSLR (Pentax k-r with kit lens)witch is very good. But my favourite camera now is the sx40. flexibility, powerful zoom, low-light capabilities, fast shooting.Iwould recommend it to anyone who likes photography, even DSLR owners... I use it a lot on my job as police officer in Brazil. Evidences, investigation... zoom, it is very useful!""
"20120530","5.0","Just Excellent","This camera exceeded my expectations and I am totally pleased with it. The Zoom has allowed me to take pictures that just weren't possible before. When at full zoom it is understandably difficult to stay on an object when not using a tripod due to movement. Couple that with an involuntary tremor in my left hand and it becomes quite difficult. With that in mind the 'anti-shake' feature built in does it's job in spades. I'll never need to buy another camera since this one does it all including hi-def movies.""
"20120529","5.0","I love it!!! Worth the money!","I love this camera! It's perfect for what I need it for. It's definitely good to know all the settings, because just using 'auto' isn't going to give you the best pictures. I have had this camera for about 6 months, and I'm still learning all the different options it has, and which settings to use in different lighting to give me the best pictures possible! One thing that I don't like about the video is that when you zoom in or out, you can hear it on the video when you download it onto your computer. Another thing that I wish were different about the camera is that it has a very small viewfinder and so it's hard to see your object very well. I just use the LCD screen instead of the viewfinder, and that works great!!It's bigger than the screen on the SX10, which I find to be an advantage. But these are very minor issues, and wouldn't stop me from buying the SX40. I really LOVE the camera!! It's just the one I need. I definitely recommend this to anyone that wants more than just a simple point-and-shoot, but doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a camera as good as an SLR. A great buy, reasonable price, and fast shipping!!""

I balked at that and started looking at the Canon SX40. I was impressed with the zoom in the store (35x) but nothing prepared me for the unbelievable pics we got when we took the camera home! The zoom is equal to 844mm's! We took a picture of the playground by the school which is 3 blocks away and it looked like we were across the street. We took a picture of a robin on the nest with her babies at about 30 feet away and you could count the hairs on the birds beak! Amazing camera. This camera was 379.00 to the Rebels' 800.00 with a separate 300mm lens. This is the camera to buy for a top of the line point and shoot! It even looks like an DSLR camera.""
"20120522","5.0","Sweet Camera","After a lot of research and some feedback from 'semi-pro' photographers at work, I decided on this camera. I wanted something that could work well in low light conditions and have a really good zoom lens. What a great choice. This thing is amazing! I took it out the first day and shot some pictures at my daughter's soccer game. The camera has a high speed setting on the wheel and it worked flawlessly. I took some great action photos with the girls game faces on and the ball sailing through the air.Just for fun I played with the zoom and was shocked at how powerful it was. I actually took a picture of a jet plane flying overhead and made out what it was. The plane was flying at a minimum 35,000 ft. I could actually see the red light under the plane in the photo. This is my first Canon and I love it. If you are looking for a super zoom, this is it.""
"20120522","5.0","Excellent Indeed","This camera does really rocks your world... it can do anything... however, I still see that If you can afford the Pana-FZ150 & don't really strive for the 35X zoom, go for the pana. BUT, this canon is just an amazing piece of tech... :)""
"20120519","5.0","Very Pleased","Love this camera.  So far, my only complaint is that I inadvertently hit the function buttons with my right hand when I am taking a photo.

"20111108","1.0","Big Disappointment!","Purchased  this camera for an upgrade to my Fujifilm FinePix S100FS that I have enjoyed immensely for the last 3-4 years.  It does all and everything I needed, but it was time to upgrade.  I anxiously awaited the arrival of the Canon SX40 and patiently waited for the battery to charge.  Once I was able to fire it up, I discovered that this camera only shoots pictures in JPEG!  No where in the flowing description of this camera does it state this!  Who in there right mind would pay 400$ for a jpeg camera - I could have saved hundreds by buying a point and shoot.  Also, the description talks about plugging the camera into an HDMI devise with the included HDMI cable - it does not come with an HDMI cable - only a USB cable!  It gives you a hot shoe cover storage bag (can you say useless??!!) - but no where does it tell you in the extremely poor getting started pages how to remove the hot shoe cover!  Would have made a lot more sense to give you an HDMI cable instead of a useless vinyl bag!It is already back in the box and will be sent back to Amazon tomorrow and I will not make another mistake buying a Canon anything!""
"20111108","5.0","One of the best point and shoots on the market.","Although I've just gotten this camera, I can tell you that it is the best point and shoot I have owned. I have two dSLRs, a Canon rebel, and a 5D. The SX40HS's image quality surpasses the Rebel (DIGC 2) and is just under the quality of my 5D. I previously used a Canon S2is and a Lumic DMC-LX3, and this camera beats the S2 tremendously in all aspects of photography, while just beating out the LX3 in short range zoomed photos. I only have two minor problem so far; one that is that sometimes at full zoom, the photos can look out of focus if you're not careful. Two, when shooting at high ISOs as most point and shoots, the photos can get a little noisy, and are useable up to ISO 1600. Other than that, there really is nothing wrong with the camera, it's a great voice for any serious amateur or pro looking for a point and shoot for daily use.""
"20111107","5.0","Great semi-pro camera!","This is an amazing camera for folks who want a lot of capability without having to get a DSLR engineering degree.  The video is as good as a lot of camcorders, and the audio fidelity is as amazing as the HD video.  I also do a lot of super-close shots of product parts, and this version automatically adjusts to that mode.""
"20111107","3.0","Electric viewfinder","While it is a very good camera for what it is intended to do, it has flaws.  The screen resolution of the monitor is very poor for this type camera.  My Canon S-95 is worlds ahead of the SX-40 monitor.  Next disappointment is the Electric Viewfinder.  It is incredibly DIM!!  Almost useless in bright sunlight.  Again, my Canon S-95 out shown this camera with its brighter monitor!  How could this be??!!  This is an ADVANCED camera!  The only reason I bought the SX-40 was for the wonderful zoom range.  I like to isolate my subjects and a 24-840 zoom range allows me to really get close.  However at extreme ranges, you MUST have a steady platform, a brace or a tripod, anything to steady the camera.  You will see what I mean if you buy the camera and try and hold it steady!  But that is expected.  Know its and your limitations.  The image quality is very good.  And remember:  Most people never have a print made bigger than a 4 X 6 anyway!!  IF they even bother to have prints made.  Most people just look at their photos on their PC.  So this is a good choice for many folks who don't NEED anything more than an all in one camera.""
"20111106","5.0","LOVE this camera!!","I've had my camera for about 6 weeks and am totally in love with it! I'm still learning a lot about what it can do, but for a point and shoot, with a long range zoom, I couldn't be more happy. I've used the sports mode at night and had great results. And the video is awesome as well. I'm sure as I learn more on what it can do, I'll be even more pleased. I'm no tech on cameras, so I won't give any advice on the different aspects of the camera. I have one trip under my belt and another one coming up, so this camera is getting a really good workout.""
"20111106","4.0","So Far So Good. Not Perfect, But What Is?. 4.5 Stars","May 23, 2012 - I have now taken over 30,000 photos with this camera, and probably would have taken 50,000 except that I didn't start using the burst mode until 6 weeks ago. Once in a while, I do have the 'universal' digital problem of the camera not 'wanting' to focus on the object, especially when the subject is a bird in front of a grassy field or worse, a bird IN a mustard field, but I've learned a secret to correct this.A bigger pain in the neck is that this camera is still not terrific in low light, and 'low light' can be defined as a cloudy day rather than just indoors. The difference between sunny and cloudy can be 1/2500 of a second to 1/50th of a second. Canon disagrees, but I notice that they and all manufacturers still have cameras without the extreme zoom that are advertised to be perfect in low light.The camera still gets 4.5 stars, and that's where it will stay. Would I buy it again? In a heartbeat, but now I really know this camera.****Nov. 3, 2011 and Jan. 13, 2012 - [Please see posted photos here and web site from my first days' and most recent shootings. A picture is worth a thousand words.] I will do a complete review as the weather clears and I can take some photos in various light conditions. So far, it has performed well enough, but there is a learning curve from the SX20 which allowed greater latitude in overriding what the camera 'wants to do.'It may take a month before I can review the camera adequately, so I have uploaded some photos that I took on the first day, and I must say that they're pretty good. However, there were only 8 out of 51 taken. ...And then it started to rain. Please note that I am not new to the Canon line or (nature) photography: I have had the A620, S3, S5, SX10, SX20, and now the SX40. (I returned the SX30 which was a terrible disappointment.) And I've been taking pictures for over 60 years. So, unless you really get to know the camera - and even then - you may or may not get the results that I do.On that note, I might add that I was sorely disappointed that Canon didn't pop for a printed manual which, with this camera, is a must. Unlike the SX20 for which I could use the SX10 manual, this camera is quite different and - so far - I think more complex or at least more different than the SX20. Because of the issues that I've run into just in 3 days, it's very difficult to cross-reference what it says under Av with Tv or C1. This is not the basic point-and-shoot Elph, and I rarely shoot in 'Auto.' As I said, I have to give it a couple of weeks before I'll pass judgment.I must say that the photos that WERE already posted when I bought the camera gave me some trepidation in that so many were a little washed out. What I am finding so far is that, 'Auto' might well be 'Average.' Average aperture, Average speed, Average contrast. But I purchased it anyway, and I've already found that Av or Tv or M are still the best settings although, unlike the SX20 where one could just set the speed and the camera would use the setting, I had to save the Tv settings to C1 or C2. This became routine by my third day (today).Nov. 8, 2011:Five days since I got the camera, and three days of shooting. I must say I've never seen so many comments regarding reviews, and many people have agreed with the more negative comments. What I've found is that the quality of photos I've taken have been excellent, needing very little post-production diddling. That said, and having used the burst mode, I'm deleting 4/5ths of the pix that I've taken, some because of duplication, some because of focus, and some because I just screwed up.In looking at the negative comments, I would admonish people to decide before buying this camera - or any other camera - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO USE THE CAMERA FOR??? I take pictures of nature, some scenery, but mostly birds, bugs, bunnies, bees, bears, and begonias. The SX40 HS has done very well in these areas, and I realize that there is a learning curve for such extreme focal lengths and the macro (which I rarely use).If you're going to take night time shots - which seems to have garnered so much comment about viewfinders and such - I can't address it. I took a picture of the (harvest) moon, hand-held, in Tv mode and it came out beautifully. But I don't take many nighttime pix, and I haven't had a chance to take fireworks in years. (If I want snapshots of people or parties, I use my wife's Elph.)I am still having some difficulty in overriding what the camera is set for re: aperture and speed. The SX20 could be overridden just by setting the speed to 1/2500th and one would get a much darker picture which could then be adjusted with software. Sometimes, it's the only way to get realistic clouds. With the SX40, I set it for 1/2500 and when I shoot, the camera comes down to 1/1600 or slower. IF I ever get the printed manual that Canon promised, I'll look for the menu where I can increase the value of the photo by -3 to +3. Yeah, I'm being a little lazy, but I hate the .pdf manual on disc that came with the camera.On the plus side, by coming down to 12 mp from 14 and by improving the processor, I can finally get SOME pix in low light or at least on a cloudy day. I've posted a few photos from the past few days: the two of the golden-crowned sparrows and the hummer were taken in low light and in thickets. They came out as sharp as anything I've ever taken with the SX10 or 20 (or S3 or S5 etc. etc.). Another plus, I am not having as much trouble with the SX40 focusing on a bird in the middle of a tree. The camera spots the center and at least HALF the time immediately seems to understand I want the bird not the branches.IF every photo I took came out perfectly, where's the fun in photography? Yes, sometimes the SX40 frustrates me, but Mother Nature sometimes frustrates me. Sometimes I think Mother Nature is picking on me. I ALWAYS though that Canon picked on everybody. After all, why do they come out with an improvement (?) every 10-12 months? Okay, the SX30 was terrible...I'll continue this in another week or so. For the time being, what I really like is the sharp photos I've been getting, and the 8 fps in the burst mode (the third is usually the best). I'm still not crazy about is the lack of an override for Tv and Av even using the C1, and I THINK the viewfinder is smaller than the SX20.Oh, btw, this camera is a few crucial (after a 5 hour hike) ounces less than the SX20. It's probably because it has a proprietary battery instead of the 4 AAs. I like the weight. What I don't like is that Canon wants $59 for a second battery, and has warned me about buying from 'the secondary market.' Comments? Suggestions? I'd appreciate knowing if there's a reliable battery that will work with this camera. (One of the other dealers offering a second battery as part of the SX40 HS package has been called out for offering a battery that doesn't fit the SX40!)I think it's silly to say that the LCD isn't as clear as a computer monitor. Never had one that was, and I'm often disappointed when something that looks in focus on the LCD is not nearly as sharp on my computer. After 12 years of digital photography, I've become accustomed to it. At least I didn't waste any film and have to wait two weeks to find out that my vacation pix are lousy.Still 4 stars for the features, 5 for the photos I've taken, and 3.5 for Canon engineers.Nov. 14, 2011.I posted more photos which speak for themselves. However, there is a caveat: I took 191 photos this morning mostly of deer, wild turkey, hawks, one praying mantis, and one tarantula. Of the 191, I posted (on my own site) 9. Here, I posted 5. And I kept 11. 180 were deleted, and that brings up two points. The burst mode of 8 fps works. That is, the SX40 really can shoot at 8 frames per second. However, not all will be in focus; many will be identical shots; and it is not the panacea for carefully composing and focusing and being at the right setting. (If you need the burst mode, you may be best off in Tv because speed is what you're after.)And please note: The battery is rated at being able to take 400 photos at the highest resolution and using the viewfinder (380 using the LCD). Well, if you shoot in the burst mode often or you take 'movies,' expect your battery to go in about 250 shots - and that's fast at 8 fps. I have just purchased two more batteries and, though they're not Canon 'approved' because they're 1/4th the price, I'm hoping that I now will never run out of batteries while shooting. Will report on that when I get them.Just one note re: the battery indicator. When the battery indicator is down from 3 (full) to 2 bars, it only takes 3-5 more photos to get it to show red and Charge the Battery. This isn't a lot more helpful than the old SX20 which allowed about 10 shots when it said to change the battery without any precursor. I was really looking forward to having a real battery indicator. This ain't it. Still 4.5 stars.Nov. 22, 2011I started this review on Nov. 3 by saying, 'So far so good,' but I had a few reservations. I no longer have reservations, and would definitely recommend the SX40 to anyone who is more than a novice photographer. This is not a 'simple' point and shoot, and you may get more than what you need or even want.It takes great photos, but you still have to know how to tweak its capabilities. If you're just going to keep this at 'Auto,' then you don't need this camera. However, if you really want such features as taking movies and using 'my colors' and a quasi-fisheye mode, this may very well be the camera for you. If you want to take pictures in RAW, this is not the camera for you (it doesn't have RAW). I care about none of these things, so for me the camera gets 4.5 stars. If you want those features, this camera may be only a 3 or 4.So basically, I'm content with my purchase. There's no second-guessing. No alternative would have made me happier. I REALLY like it, but I don't love it. BUT look at it this way: if I got perfect pictures every time, it would take all the fun out of digital photography. I still need room for creativity ... and improvement.""

"20111028","5.0","New camera for me, but an excellent tweener!","This is a replacement for my Kodak P850.  It offers so much more with the 35X zoom and is so much more than just a point and shoot camera.  I have purchased the close up lenses, and UV and Polaroid, which come with the necessary adapter to fit the lens.  For macro photos you will need the closeup lenses.  The pictures are of very good quality, but you do need to use a tripod for the telephoto long lens views, has IS but needs steadying.  I really like the multi angle monitor screen, and it is bright enough to see in good light, but still you have the through the lens eye piece to use too. I have only had this camera three weeks, so am learning it's qualities, and have not found anything to be disappointed about.  I also have a Canon EOS SLR with lenses, and a pocket Nikon point and shoot to round out my equipment.  I always want a camera at the ready, and this one is light enough to carry easily.  Watch out if you buy this with an extra battery bundle deal.  I did, and the battery is the wrong one for this camera...but Amazon has an easy return policy.  This one takes a new battery that is not yet available on Amazon.""
"20111028","5.0","Canon Powershot SX40 worthwhile","This camera is amazing. It has a fantastic zoom and an amazing image stabilizer. I took amazing pictures without blur even at long distances and with the object in movement. Its body is well done, as the same as the other Canon products. The HD recording is amazing and the zoom works during the recording - another amazing capability! Also an interesting function is the ability of take a picture during recording a movie - this can be useful in some situations, like events and sports. To get the best experience, put a class 10 SD card to store the pictures and movies. About specific photography functions, its very good too: you can set two different configurations modes what can be selected by the mode button. You can also change every variable, such as focus, ISO quality, time, etc., for almost professional experience taking pictures.""
"20111026","4.0","Excellent camera--Canon finally got it right!","I've had both of the predecessors to this camera--the SX20 IS and the SX 30IS.  The new processor in this camera really works where those were 'iffy'.  Stabilization is excellent even at 840mm (equivalent) and the pictures are crystal clear with minimal chromatic aberration and fringing (means they are sharp and relatively undistorted).  The burst mode is fantastic--you can shoot up to 8 frames at 10 frames per second with this camera and it really works the way it is supposed to.  It even uses the programmed settings and will do exposure bracketing in burst mode.  My only complaint is that the zoom framing assist button (which is the same as the one on the SX30 IS) is placed where your thumb would normally be so it is difficult to shoot without inadvertently pressing it, which is why I didn't give it a 5 star rating.  The zoom framing assist button itself is very helpful because it is difficult at full zoom to find a fast moving bird in the frame so it allows  you to back the zoom off temporarily until you can re-acquire the image and then zoom in to shoot it.  Picture quality is excellent with the new Digic 5 image processor, often rivaling the quality of pictures I've taken with my DSLR.  This is a great all-around camera that although it is not pocketable is small enough and light enough to take anywhere.""
"20111025","5.0","Love it! Probably the best SuperZoom on the market.","I've had it for about a month now and while I haven't quite conquered everything on it and I haven't quite got it all down in my head yet, I've taken some really nice shots with it so far.I'm a former Panasonic FZ user who started back in '05 with an FZ20 and as Panasonic made improvements on their FZ line, I continued to upgrade as well. From the FZ20, I moved up to the FZ28 and then the FZ35 and finally, I got the FZ100, which I use as a expensive paperweight.After the FZ100 debacle, I started looking for a new brand of SuperZoom and after 2 previous hiccups buying and returning highly hyped, but not delivering cameras, I came across the SX40 HS at my local club store and bought it just on it's specs and hoping the Canon name would deliver. What also helped in my decision was the knowledge that the club had a 90 day return policy, not a 30 day one like Amazon.I bought the camera on my way to work and when I got home I wanted to see if I could unpack it, toss in the battery and go out and get a good Moon shot without having any previous experience with Canon digital's. Would it be so intuitive that I could get a really good shot of the Moon without having ever held one in my hand, without even looking at the manual? I wanted to know.The answer was yes. I turned the dial to Manual and in no time I had the correct setting and got much better hand-held Moon shots than anything I've ever gotten from my Panasonic's on a tripod.I'm still a work on progress and I haven't had a chance to test it out in all the areas I use them in, like indoor shots of blues bands in small clubs. So far I've been super happy with it.The only downside's that I have with it is that a second battery is gonna cost me almost $70 and that Canon doesn't supply a paper manual for it. You get a disk and the manual is 200+ pages in PDF, which doesn't work for me. I took the disk to a local quick print place and they refused to make me a paper copy of the manual because the disk is copyrighted. The saving grace in all of this is that Canon has pretty good customer service and after talking to their rep on the phone I was able to get them to make me a nice full size copy, which they sent to me free of charge. Thank You Canon!""
"20111025","4.0","so far so good","I had an SX5 so this was a step up.  I haven't had it long enough to really write a good detailed review but so far it is great.  I did have to purchase the screen protector and polarized lens covers separately to protect it.  The zoom is awesome - it handles well.  My only beef so far is that they changed the on/off to a button and it is too easy to hit it while stowing in my camera bag which is irritating.  Never happened when you had to push a lever to turn it on.""
"20111023","2.0","It sucks. There is a new childproof governor on Manual setting.","The Manual setting on the new SX40 has a new childproof governor on it. The SX30 did not.  Try to set the ISO at 400 for a night shot, and then spin the dial towards a 15 second shutter speed. It stops it at 1 second and drops the ISO to 100. Then a message appears on the LCD which says, 'ISO speed is limited due to slow shutter speed.' I verified it with the Canon Tech Dept. They also verified that the previous Canon cameras DID allow full Manual control in setting both the ISO and shutter speed, but no more.This has halted a large portion of the sunset and night photography I have been doing of the Monterey Bay Harbor for the past 2 years. It is condescending and insulting to adults in general and to long-term Canon users in particular to presume to say to us, 'We think you don't know what you are doing, you must be an errant child, and we have put a childproof governor on the SX40 so that you cannot use those manual settings anymore.' Obviously if we use a Manual setting it is precisely because we do know what we are doing!  Canon needs to UPGRADE its firmware to make the SX40 at least as good as the SX30, not DOWNGRADE its features to make it worse.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&UPDATE:  Many of you have asked me for an example of nighttime time-exposure photos* of Monterey Bay Harbor for comparison. Here it is.* [When I first made the video I did not yet understand the subtle distinction between 'time-exposure' and 'time-lapse' photos. The more precise term is 'time-exposure,' but the video still shows the less accurate term 'time-lapse.']I agree that overall the Canon SX40 is an excellent camera. I still use mine during the daytime. I am not arguing about 'overall.' That is not my point.For me, personally, the SX40 has a fatal flaw, and a flaw that no one would normally expect in a camera of this caliber and price range.  It won't take simple time-exposure night shots. Why not?I had to buy an older SX30 just to 'upgrade' my full use of it.  If you think that having to pay twice for what should have come in one camera in the first place put me in a good mood, then you would be mistaken.You may watch this short video, if you like, and see the evidence for yourself.  If you disagree, then by all means please show me your evidence.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&SECOND UPDATE:  There is another limit on the SX40.  This one is in plain sight and it effects everyone who wants to use this camera on a tripod.  Please see Page 16 of the Comments for more details.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&THIRD UPDATE:  Another poster has stated the following, 'Certain things in a camera are a given. 1) a true manual mode. 2) have the battery & memory card in a convenient place.' This poster is absolutely right. Please see pages 17 and 18 of the Comments for more details.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&FOURTH AND FINAL UPDATE:  March 11, 2012;  Canon's conduct of imposing this ISO limit on the SX40 in secrecy has now been fully exposed for what it is by its own corporate rival, Fujifilm.  After five months of fighting  against this, I have now been fully vindicated by the openness and honesty of the Fujifilm corporation. I shall now be taking my leave of you on this post and I will be returning to my former routine of enjoying my own photography.  See Page 22 of the Comments section for details.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&AFTERMATH UPDATE:  March 31, 2012;  I have come to the conclusion that the Canon SX40 is like a thoroughbred race horse penned up in a stable made for a dimwitted donkey. It is a camera with a tremendous potential over a wide range of photographic interests that is being held trapped inside a childproof box.  After having tested the camera myself with CHDK - a form of public, hacker software for the camera, available for free download on the internet - I can see that the ISO limit is only a very small part overall of what is actually being limited. When you take those limits off of it by using CHDK, what the SX40 camera really can do is absolutely staggering.I don't like having to resort to a hacker program like CHDK to get the settings I want with the SX40.  Unfortunately, it seems that CHDK is simply 'the only game in town' if you want to have the freedom to use the Canon SX40 to its fullest potential.  Please see page 25 of the Comments for further details.Best Wishes to All, and to All a Goodnight,  John""

"20111018","5.0","Happy SX40 owner!","I am a complete novice at photography and bought the camera mainly to aid in identifying birds in the field (bird watcher)and for casual vacation trips.  After a few days, I am quite pleased with the quality of pictures (butterflies, birds, etc.) and ease of use.  Camera seems to do good in relatively low light and long distances.  Bird pictures I get from it are sometimes better than the view I get from my expensive binoculars.  A great camera, particularly if one does not want to carry around a heavy SLR.  This camera takes a Canon NB-10L battery and not not the Canon NB-7L used in the SX30.  I accidently ordered the NB-7L ($6)for my SX40 camera and it is too big.  I am having trouble at this point of finding an inexpensive NB-10L battery (about $64 at Amazon).

"20111017","5.0","Very nice sub-SLR","Well, Canon finally got it right.  I had gotten the SX10 IS, then sold and got the SX20 IS.  I liked the SX10, but the SX20 image quality was NOT as nice as the SX10.  Then, I thought that Canon made improvements on the SX30 and I tried that, but I returned it.  Not for me.  This SX40 finally has a CMOS sensor.  Virtually no lag in taking photos, burst mode is great, low light is awesome.  Zoom is terrific, as is the image stabilization.I still have my dSLR for my professional needs, but for an all-around point and shoot that's several cuts above the average P&S, this is a nice piece of equipment.For anyone getting image blur, you are not using a high enough shutter speed.  With the camera set to manual, you should be able to play around with the shutter speed.  Review your images.  The metadata will tell you what your shutter speed was on an exposure.  If you are trying to photograph a horse race @ 1/30 of a second, no image stabilization will save you.  IS helps compensate for camera shake by the operator or wind, it will NOT compensate for subject movement.  For example, no image stabilization system will make a hummingbird shot at 1/10 sec. look clear!""
"20111016","3.0","Nice specs but not the camera for me","Have been playing with this camera for about1 week. It takes good pictures overall but my issues are the shutter speed and the motion blur that I am experiencing even in the action mode.  I have a Panasonic fx18 right now that is 4 years old and it stops motion better than this camera.  Even with image stabilization on I am having sever issues with blur especially when you start to use more of the zoom.  I have issues with the shutter as there is too much time between when the button to take a picture is pressed and the actual shot.  I love the video and it has great features including easy to use manual settings but I can't see paying the money for something with such annoying flaws.""
"20111016","5.0","Excellent Point&Shoot with one minor complaint!","I did lot of research and web surfing before getting this camera. I was mostly looking at Sony NeX 5n, Sony Hx9v and I kind of looked at this camera since there were only 9 reviews. I think i got lucky that i purchased this camera. I got this camera one day before my son was born and i had no problems in learning to use this camera in one hour. Concerning the PICTURE QUALITY, its excellent, low light, day light, and zoom is amazing. The 1080p Video is amazing too with one minor issue that i have found, the camera makes a 'hissing' noise from the lens motor when you zoom in and out when recording video and this sound is picked up by the internally located microphone. So unless you are shooting in a club, concert or any loud place, you will not notice but your daily run of the mill movie clips its very easily picked up.Then i decided to get the Sony Hx9v and guess what?? that camera is worst than the 7 megapixel canon i have had before. Its colors in pictures are very saturated on the camera LCD and once you transfer it to the computer they look dull, blurry and NOT 16 megapixels that Sony advertises. The video quality is not 1080p crisp and clear as the Canon Sx40hs. The camera is difficult to learn how to use and i am guessing even if you do, you will not be happy with the quality of the pictures or video.so in conclusion, i will not recommend a family member or a friend to buy the Sony Hx 9v for shooting photos or videos. I would definitely recommend buying the Canon Powershot Sx40hs with the warning that the hissing noise you hear when you zoom in and out during video recording.""
"20111016","5.0","A camera for demanding photographers","I got my SX40HS on October 6 2011. Ifound it really great.Users from beginners up to experienced photographers will enjoy that camera.Beginners will get excellent pictures using the 'automatic' mode, while experienced users will have plenty of parameters to play with, to really obtain desired image effects.Beginers will get ample possibilities to start perfecting their photography taking skills. Experienced users will have a light versatile camera that can be taken at all times without having to carry the heavy load of a DSLR camera and its lenses in a cumbersome bag...That's exactly why I bought this Canon SX40HS: when going out on casual walks in town or by the sea side, I wanted to go out with a lighter equipment than my photographic bag containing my DSLR camera and at least three zoom lenses. Reserving the whole DSLR kit for dedicated photographic expeditions...So far , using the SX40HS to test in the most difficult conditions,I've had only good results... Obtaining unexpected high quality pictures in the worst light conditions. I have posted some of the pictures on various photographic forums in regular 'forum' picture size as well as 100% crop tests. Very advanced photo experts have been impressed by these images quality after a 100% picture crop...Some are available on a specific facebook album I created for the purpose of sharing this rather early image test in regular use conditions.[...]Video amateurs will be glad to learn that the digital zoom functions very well, enabling seemless zooming on a moving subject from 24mm focal length up to 840mm optical zoom and further to 4X numeric zoom. I tested that on photographic pictures and they are astonishigly good... In video they would be even better as, video runing at 24 images/second, lets the eyes compensate for minute imperfections...I was already very happy with the previous Canon Bridge SX10IS, but here this new Canon Bridge image quality and feature availability is really superb.Note that I will use it as very longtelephoto lens when going out with my DSLR camera for which I only have a 16_105 zoom lens and a 70-300mm zoom lens, not enough for some shootings...Paul""

"20111015","5.0","Worth every penny!!!","I bought this camera a few weeks ago, it is an early Christmas present from my husband!!  After I read up on the reviews by professionals (which I find sometimes biased) I tried to find some USER reviews which are the reviews I always base my decision buying on, but could only find 2 on amazon.  I decided to buy it because I knew I could always return it.  Well, let's just say I have not been able to put it down!  I currently own a Canon Rebel which is 6 years old and have never been totally happy with it, especially sport shots which are very tricky especially indoors and low light.  This camera far exceeds any camera I have ever owned and I have owned Sony, Olympus & Canon.  BUY IT!  You will not regret it.  I see the price has dropped since I purchased it 2 weeks ago as I paid $429.99 but even at that price it is worth every penny.  Sports shots have come out fantastic and I even took a picture of the moon with the 35x optical zoom withOUT a tripod, it came out magnificent!!!!  Super clear !  The video is nice too and I love being able to video and then take a picture while videoing!  Landscape shots are fantastic just play with all the modes to see which works best for you and oh let me tell you about the VIVID color!

After getting acquainted with my new camera a bit, I have to say it's truly a big step up from the sx30 (which I also own). The camera seems more responsive overall. The auto definitely works better. Pictures are crystal clear. And low light pictures are simply amazing. I even tested ISO 3200 with a nightlight and it produced a usable image with very little noise. Also, since the camera is more responsive to low light the zoom seems to work much better because low light zoom pics are very clear and have negligible noise.. This camera is simply a wonderful value for the money. Buy it.""
"20120518","5.0","Perfect for the guy who wants it all in one package","I started photography at twelve years old. I went through many fazes as developing and enlarging in my own darkrooms and multiple accessories including a bunch of lenses. Now I am seventy eight and want it simple, but I also want to do everything I did with the complicated outfits. The SX 40 does it! I just took it to a local popular lake. It was hazy. I used equivalent focal lengths from 24 to 1680 mm. I had no trouble getting sharp pictures under these conditions. I used it hand held. Hint, use the view finder and hold it steady not the LCD screen held out where it is not steady. That is okay for most shots but not long telephotos. I had an SX10 that I liked but with a double set of extra batteries it was heavy. The one lithium rechargeable needed for this is much lighter. I do carry a spare. This is not for the person who wants all the technical stuff as I once did but it is the one for me now.""
"20120517","5.0","I love this camera","Having used this camera for about 6 months, I am very happy with it. We previously used an S1is and a S5is, and both were good. But maybe this one is almost great. An amazing lens achievement.I wish Canon had incorporated an integral lens thread, rather than having to use a hokey adapter that sort of snaps on, then comes off when looked at crosswise.And I wish Canon's accompanying software was better. They have dropped some features that used to be present (e.g. RemoteCapture app), and they have made CameraWindow.app SO terribly kludgey.EDIT - We have started digitizing our ancient 35mm slides directly with this camera. No fancy adapter needed - happily, the close-focus and automation of this camera make the task a snap! We added a 58mm adapter and a +2 diopter lens (to avoid the barrel distortion at wider angles), and we modified a 58mm ring with notches to stabilize the position of the subject slide. Using either macro mode and autofocus, or manual focus at about 0.8 inch, works very nicely. With the camera set for 4000 x 3000, after uploading to the computer, a quick slap of a cropping routine on the computer deletes the excess scene, resulting in a 2700 by 1700 pixel scene.""
"20120516","5.0","VERY GOOD improvement from the PowerShot SX 30IS... Love this camera!!!","After almost two years of being fooling around with a Canon PowerShot SX 30IS, I found out that being this a great camera is not exactly what I had been looking for.At the very end, I noticed it has something to do with the CCD image processor included in the SX 30IS.As a new alternative, I also tried the Canon PowerShot G 12. And even when this one is at no doubt a great camera, it's not what I expected either.I was also considering other Superzoom choices (Nikon P510, Panasonic DMC-FZ 150K). These two cameras are awesome pieces of technology.BUT... Honestly speaking, I consider Nikon P510 operation is not very friendly for Amateur ('Rookie') photographers.Inn the other hand, I ever found all the reasons why Panasonic DMC-FZ 150K could be considered a 'much better' camera as many specialized Photo websites state.I say this, mainly because this camera is more expensive than the SX 40HS. But, when compared image quality with Canon SX 40HS, I didn't like its color definition at all.Finally, I decided to spend my money in the PowerShot SX 40HS... I know, it has some limitations on the lowest ISO (100) level, and also I was aware it's not able to work with RAW files.But... What a lovely quality it has for plain, simple shots!!!  Landscapes, family/friends meetings, pets, your children/family sports and so on. Including a CMOS processor in it, has been a wise decision.Either if you decide to keep your shotss saved in .JPEG format or if you print them, you'll get amazing quality pictures!!!Anyway, if you want more ellaborate (close to Pro editing) pictures, be noticed that you can fix any of your your shots with Photoshop, Picasa, or even with the very simple photo editor Canon includes in a CD that comes with the camera (including the PDF version of the 200-page Instruction Manual).In addition, with the PowerShot SX 40HS you'll have all similar multiple shooting choices as in the SX 30IS (Sports, Portrait, Landscape, Beach, Nature, Fish-eye, Miniature, Fireworks, Bright Colors, etcetera)... All this, plus the unbelievable high quality of the 35x Superzoom lens... And even the additional hotshoe for any of the Canon Speedlite additional Flash sets.So if you want to become a 'More-than-an-Amateur-but-Not-exactly-a-Pro' photographer, the Canon PowerShot SX 40HS is your right choice!! Bravo Canon once again!!""

"20120513","5.0","See my posted photo samples to judge for yourself","I was looking for a replacement for my trusty Sony DSC-HX1.  I liked my Sony but after 30,000 shots and dropping it a few times, it was starting to show it's wear by not recognizing some of my settings.The Canon SX40 made my wish list after playing around with it at Best Buy.  I especially liked the effects options and the impressive zoom.  I could not find any really good examples of these features in other reviews so here goes.Overall, this camera takes great photos.  I prefered using P mode vs automatic because of the additional features availble in this setting.  It's just like using Auto but with many more tools.The main reason for my review is to provide insights on other features for those that have already determined that the camera is pretty good based on other reviews.Zoom - it does what the mfr features say. At maximum zoom it is very hard to hold steady, even by using a solid base such as a rail or tripod.  There is a very useful button called the Zoom assist which you hold down so you can locate your subject again.  I ended up backing off on zoom and relying on cropping to get the final result I was looking for.  (I finally discovered in an obscure section of the manual that digital zoom can only be used in 4:3 or 16:9 mode)Color Accent - I liked this feature when it was first introduced on earlier models.  I took it to a Laker game and the only real issue is that it has trouble recognizing purple.  You'll see from my posted samples that Laker purple looks more like blue.  There's no way to change white balance in this mode.  But it's a neat gimmicky feature that is still fun to use.Fish Eye - I like the options.  You have 3 degrees to choose from.  I like the highest level to really get some cool images.Miniature Effect - This was tough to figure out. Mostly because I wasn't sure why anyone would use it.  But I did find that for wider shots, and when there are many subjects in a plane (such as on a basketball court), it can provide an interesting perspective.  See my posted example.Fast Shutter - My Sony HX1 has a way to adjust the speed of fast shutter.  You can choose low, medium, and high.  You only get up to 10 shots in a burst.  But you have to wait until it saves all of them before you can shoot again. This can take up to 17 seconds.  I found that the Canon has only one basic default speed (there is a high speed burst mode in the creative filters mode, but you don't get to keep some of the settings you have in M, P, T or A mode).  But I accidentally discovered that I didn't have to wait for all the shots to be saved if I pressed halfway down on the shutter.  And there's no limit to the number of shots.  Just hold down the shutter until your done.I want to point out that I used Picasa to create collages of various photos so that you can see 3 or 4 shots in one frame.  Even though this meant some cropping, I hope you'll find these helpful in determining if this camera's other lesser discussed features make it a good choice for you.I like this camera - a lot.  I do think that most users will also enjoy using this as you learn each of the features.""
"20120511","5.0","Concert Photos","I purchased this camera to use at concerts since they won't let you bring a DSLR.  I bought it the day before the concert so I didn't get much time to play with it but the pictures came out fantastic and I had no idea what I was doing!! Im sure if I had more time to play around with it I could've taken better pictures.  For reference the concert was at night.  The zoom was great! There was a lot of bass at the show so the audio wasn't the best but nothing I couldn't clean up in iMovie. I would've posted the video but it was a Drake concert so the language is bad. I did post some photos to give people an idea of the possibilities. I also had no problem getting in the concert with it so I will keep it for other shows.""
"20120510","4.0","Wonderful camera! Fun use w/ lots of manual control.","I was looking for something in between my little P&S camera and my DSLR. I wanted something with more power & zoom than the P&S but a lot lighter and more versatile than my heavy DSLR w/ lenses. This camera met almost all my needs. I've had it for about 2 weeks so I still have a lot of things to test but so far, it has been excellent. easy enough to carry every day, everywhere but also provides near DSLR quality & control. It's not a replacement for my DSLR as I can still see the difference but it's a nice alternative for me when I don't want to carry it around.The zoom is amazing. I used it as a baseball game sitting in left field 400 level seats and I could get shots into the dugout that were pretty clear. Action shots are a bit tough if you are zoomed in far but work well at closer range. If you have a tripod or can steady your shot, it will help when zoomed in. Video quality is good though I haven't done much with it. I really like the swivel LCD. I can get low, high & angled shots much easier now.A few things I didn't like. Maybe it's because I come from a DSLR, the camera felt so tiny in my hands. It's shaped like a mini DSLR with the hand grip but smaller so it was a bit awkward at first but you get used to it. Some of the menu option & controls aren't as intuitive as my other canon. Again, maybe because I've been so used to DSLRs. I couldn't figure out how to switch from view finder to LCD. But I also really like that you can switch between these two options. But using the view finder is a bit awkward since the camera is small.I'll come back and do a better review once I've had a chance to play with it more but so far, I am really loving it.""
"20120510","5.0","Canon sx40. Great camera","I've had the Canon sx40 for some weeks now and I really love this camera. I'm not a professional I just love taking photos. I love taking photos at night of the city. I was reluctant to buy this camera because of the bad low light reviews. But I found out that's not so, the sx40 takes great photos at night, so I don't know what people are talking about. Photos look beautiful when I look at them on the computer. I can't believe I'm taking such great shots. Day photos are amazing and look very sharp and beautiful. they look like magazine photos. Some say if you want a point and shoot camera then buy a compact camera. I usually point and shoot but I also wanted a camera with great zoom lens and great wide angle. With this camera you have the best of both without the high price tag. The videos also look great. This is such a great and fun camera to own. I'm learning lots of the things that this camera can do and I'm so very satisfied with this purchase.""
"20120509","5.0","Very Good Camera","I'll start off by saying that I am no camera techie, I am just someone who was looking for a step up from the point and shoot category, and this camera got good reviews from almost everyone. And I can't disagree, this is a fun camera that takes very nice pictures. If you are looking for a bridge camera, or if you're looking for a slight steup up this camera might be for you. If you are looking to use photography as a hobby, then maybe a low end DSLR camera might be a better option.The pros: the ease of use, for someone unfamiliar with DSLR this camera is great and affordable. The zoom is awesome and fun. There will be some pros out there that will tell you that the zoom is good but that it does not compare with zoom lenses from DSLR's. This is comparing apples to oranges, a DSLR camera is superior in every way, but the price is waaaayyyy superios as well.The cons: doesn't do great in low lighting, and the shutter speed is dissapointing. I read the Panasonic lumix has better shutter speed, so, if you're primary use for the camera is action or sports, than another camera might be better suited for you.Overall, I am very happy with the camera, outdoor pictures and pictures taken in good lighting look great. Again, the zoom in the camera is very fun to play with, and the stablization technology they have in the camera works very well. I recommend this camera for anyone who wants a step up from the point and shoot cameras while still maintaining the simplicity of use from that category.""
"20120501","4.0","Good all around Mom camera","I've had this camera for a couple of months now and have been trying it out in a lot of different situations.  Although I haven't mastered when to use what setting, I am very pleased with the purchase.  Auto works well in most situations.  I had canon cameras before, then moved to the Nikon 8100 trying to find a good point & shoot for photos of  my son playing sports.  The Nikon worked well outside in bright light but was abysmal for indoor functions.  I considered a DSLR but didn't want to carry all the equipment or pay so much for a family camera.  So far I've used the SX40 for backyard nature pix, family photos, trips to the zoo & the circus as well as other museum excursions.  It has worked quite well.  Although I took a couple of photography classes years ago, my memory of ISO & other photo terms is fuzzy to say the least, so I have been just trying different settings and looking through the instruction book on disk when I have time.Somehow I turned off the digital zoom when the camera first arrived, so I wasn't sure why everyone was so enthralled with the zoom.  It was good but not spectacular.  Once I got the digital back on I see what the fuss was all about.The camera is a bit large to tuck into a handbag, and I got a neoprene cover to protect it without a bulky bag, but it is a lot less to carry around than a DSLR.  Overall a great camera for daily family life & special occasions.""
"20120428","5.0","Very pleasant camera to shoot with once you learn where things are","I've spent the last 10 or more years be hide a large DSLR. For me, and this is a completely personal opinion is that lugging around that much stuff is NO fun 95 percent of the time. I finally decided to let go of the larger camera and move back to something that will get me out shooting again. After having this little guy for awhile I can tell you it has done just that. The manual that comes with it sucks. Only part is printed and the rest is on the cd rom. Just play around with the camera for 30 minutes and you will have it figured out on your own. Each setting lets you know what it does which is a great little tool when setting up your camera.Some of the Positives for this camera:Super zoom - when I had my dslr rig I would have needed to carry at least 3 other lenses to get this range. Not to mention there is no affordable method to get you out to 850mm on a dslr!Macro - on the completely opposite side you can get very very close up and personal with things. Add to that the filter attachment and a raynox 250 and you got a pretty sweet macro.Swivel screen - Unlike most of the others Canon has a screen that can swivel around and not just up and down like a few others.Ease of use - Once you learn how to access the features it is so fast and easy to get back in and adjust them on the fly.Movies - Excellent quality videos with the ability to do some high speed stuff makes video fun on this. Just note that if you do high speed video you quality will drop down. It was something I didn't see before purchasing the camera.Image Quality - Viewing these images at 50 percent I can not tell much difference from a dslr. Above that and I can start to see changes. It states a 16x20 can be printed but I would not believe that. Perhaps on ideal settings you might be able to get a 13x19 that looks good but I have not tried it yet. Pixel peeps and people with not much else to do but analyze might find more but I'm just not obsessed with that. If you are that person, you are looking at the wrong camera.Stabilization - It works, it works and it works wonderfully. At 800mm I can get a nice sharp image, that is pretty amazing to me.Cons or things I'd like to see changed -Screen resolution - Compared to others the screen on the back in pretty dated. Personally I like to see histograms and focus points more so I'm not too worried about it. But do know it isn't the best out there. Hopefully in the next version Canon will update it.Auto assist Green light - It is on by default in video and makes for some pretty silly lights on your subject. I think it should be off on video by default.lens cap - Gotta put on and take off a cap. Wouldn't be so bad if the cap wasn't so little bitty. Either beef up the cap or find a way to do away with it.no raw - I'm adding this to Cons since most people want it. Personally I could care less. I love the fact that my file sizes are smaller. I can still get in ACR in lightroom or photoshop if I want. And there is always the Canon mode that lets you install RAW if you really have to have it. I'd rather be shooting than editing though.Overall I'm happy with my new camera and don't regret the move one bit. Again it was a completely personal decision on my part and your results might vary... :)""
"20120427","4.0","Almost perfect-good for advanced hobbyists","I debated between this camera and another one that costs almost twice as much. I finally settled on this one and I'm glad I did. Focus is rapid and smooth and the pictures are tack sharp. The articulating screen is very useful. All the basic settings are easy to find and easy to use. The sensor handles difficult lighting easily.The size is good, it cradles in the hand nicely and balances well, even at extreme zoom settings. The readout on the screen is easy to see and intuitive to use.What would make this camera perfect is including a printed manual. I know it saves paper and costs to not print one, but perhaps Canon could offer to send you one if you register the product. Or somebody could publish one as a third market item. You only need it for advanced settings but honestly, the PDF instructions are a nuisance to navigate.""
"20120427","1.0","Terrible Ergonomic Design!","I've owned a number of Canon products & they have always been excellent. But Canon really blew it on this one. The back of the camera has an indentation where the end of your thumb goes, as do many cameras. The probem is that the rest of your thumb is right over key controls which are VERY sensitive. So when you hold the camera as intended, settings are always changing because your thumb cannot help but contact the buttons.I spent more time fighting with the camera than I did taking pix. Returned it after using it twice. Don't these designers make a mock-up to try out before going into production? DUH!!!""
"20120424","3.0","I am done with Canon.","I read in one of the reviews that this particular model of Canon does closeups nicely.  I have already returned SX150 a few weeks back to Best Buy.  This camera is much more expensive than SX150.  I really was not expecting much other than to be able to take closeup pictures in low light. My wife makes jewellery and she needed this camera to take closeup pictures of the jewellery. Let me explain the difference between Macro Photography and zooming.  Both relate to closeups.  In macro photography, the camera is very close to the physical object and the optical lenses do most of the work.  This camera is great for that, and so was SX150.  When I placed the camera, two to three feet apart from the object and try to zoom in, I could never get it to focus in Automatic as well as manual mode.  The best test you can do it to sit on a chair and spread your legs, and try to focus on your toe.  I am so disappointed that my five year old Canon had the same symptoms and we are still stuck at the same place even today.So, for me, it's Goodbye Canon!  I will definitely miss you.""
"20120422","5.0","Puts the FUN in Photography!","I have a digital SLR camera with a couple professional-grade lenses.  Yes, I can take technically better photographs with them - but only in limited circumstances! If I want a picture of a goldfinch at my feeder, this is the camera I grab!  The pictures this takes are so good, and the camera is SO versatile, it's just FUN!  I don't worry about changing lenses, changing settings, or getting tripods.  I can respond to almost any situation just by zooming and pressing the shutter button.  The DIGIC-V processor/HS sensor used in the camera really makes the most of the 35x zoom.  The images show remarkably little digital noise - almost to the quality of my first dSLR!  And the integral anti-shake image-stabilization makes that monster-zoom range entirely useful!  I took a photograph indoors at night with room lighting - no flash - at full-zoom.  That's the equivalent of an 840mm telephoto on an old 35mm film camera.  The SX40 HS used a shutter speed of 1/20 of a second with a film speed equivalent of 1250 - and it looked good.  No tripod.  No blur (at least, not on my computer screen).  I was ecstatic!  PLUS - the camera I got was still made in Japan (which I happen to find reassuring).  If you want RAW picture files (a common criticism of the Powershots, because they don't use them), you'll have to make up your own mind whether to splurge for one of the competition's models.  For me, if I need a RAW file, I need a dSLR to start with anyway.  However, if you're one of the vast majority of folks who hasn't a clue about the difference between a 'RAW' file and a jpg file, don't worry about it - I'm confident you'll have all the camera you need to have all the fun you can imagine in this unit.  I do highly advise to take time to read the user's guide completely - a few pages at a time (there are about 120 pages).  The guide is on a disk with the camera - or you can download it from Canon.  Print out the pages that seem the most interesting or appealing to you, try them out with the camera to get some experience with the features - and soon you'll be taking pictures you would never have believed possible!""

I was really  thinking about a DSLR,  but if I had bought  a Rebel, I would  still have to buy an additional  lens  to improve the versatility.  This is one camera , with one lens that has the best of both worlds (close ups and extreme zooms).  It is the best  bridge between  point and shoot and  Extreme (Not Beginner) DSLR.  I would definitely recommend this camera, before buying a beginner DSLR (although the manual settings are a bit limited).  The image quality is great, and you will be impressed with the versatility.""
"20120413","5.0","Great Camera for the Money","I got this camera a week ago to replace a Canon PowerShot G6 and couldn't be happier. If you are like me and want a great camera for family photos I highly recommend this one. The optical zoom is fantastic and I took some macro shots and they were beautiful. Over Easter we had a family gathering at a restaurant and I took a lot of photos, mostly with flash but some with low light settings and they were all great. I also purchased the Canon lens hood and it was easy to install and will help protect the lens. I took a picture of a plane flying over the house with full zoom, as the plane was a long way off, and you could read the planes tail numbers. I have showed my pictures to a number of people, including one friend who uses a Canon D7 DSLR and they all are amazed. My friend with the D7 couldn't believe the shots I could make from macro to amazing zoom shots. He was carrying his camera equipment in a backpack and even with all this equipment he couldn't handle all the shots I was making with the SX40. If you aren't a pro and just want to be able to produce some fantastic photos this camera will definitely do the job and at a great price.""

Great zoom.","Canon Powershot SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch Vari-Angle Wide LCDI bought this camera for $399.00. The very next day, the price had dropped. I was pretty upset, as Amazon was advertising a 'bundle' with a lot more items to do with the camera for the same price I had paid, $399.00I received the camera as promised within  two days.  I couldn't wait to try it out.I don't use a lot of the manual settings but I found the quality of picture very good.  The main thing I like about this camera  is the zoom. For wildlife photography, mainly birds, it's superb.  I am now free from carrying all the extra lenses etc that I had with my other camera. With my very arthritic hands it's a plus to just have a light camera with an exceptional zoom to take with me on bird shoots.There are things I don't like about it, however.I don't like a push button to turn it on and offI don't like the small viewfinder. The subject looks miles away until I bring it in with the zoom lever.I don't like where the various buttons are as it's too easy to press one of them by mistake.It feels cheap to hold after my bigger and more expensive cameras.I would have liked a written manual rather than an online one.BUT, for the price, I'd say it's very good value.""
"20120405","3.0","Canon messed-up a great line of cameras with this model.","I've had 3 Canon Powershots in a row, and loved the idea of moving up to a 35X zoom. But I didn't do my homework, and overestimated Canon's competence. I ended up having the return my SX40. One of the best things about this series of cameras has always been the use of 4 AA batteries. This gives tremendous freedom, using those wonderful Eneloop rechargables most of the time, but being able to throw in regular AAs in a pinch. Being reliant on a proprietary battery pack is just silly. I also made the mistake of assuming Canon had fixed its lack of an external mike input. In these days, when we're all posting videos to YouTube for business or for fun, not being able to plug in a shotgun mike seriously compromises the video value of this camera. Too bad: I'm a big fan of Canon products, but they've lost this customer.""

"20120404","3.0","Great picture quality, horrible AF","Bought this because I needed a compact super-zoom camera.  Well, the first surprise was the size.  It was a bit larger than I expected.  In fact, it's only slightly smaller than a regular Canon DSLR, so if you're buying this to lug around all day instead of a bulky heavy DSLR, you're going to practically carry around the same sized camera (minus a gigantic 800mm zoom lens, so you do shave off some significant lens bulk).  Despite the size, there was much to like about the SX40.  The image quality was great, even better than a G10 I owned a few years ago.  I never bought the G12, so I can't compare the quality to that, but several online forums say the quality is as good or even better than the G12 (these are forum opinions, not mine).  The CMOS sensor produced crisp sharp photos with nice color saturation.  The video quality was equally as impressive, rivaling my ACVHD camcorder.  Sound quality was also great with barely noticeable motor noise when zooming.  The biggest problem I encountered, which ultimately caused me to return it, was sporadic auto-focus.  In a nutshell, it just missed way too many shots.  The worst part is, these were static subjects, not moving targets.  Funny thing is, it actually perfectly froze a fast moving shot I took of an automobile but couldn't focus on several still subjects I was trying to photograph in moderate light.  The AF just kept hunting but could never find the proper focus.  As a result, one-third of my shots were blurry and out of focus despite adequate focal length.  Maybe I got a lemon, but a 66% success rate was unacceptable.  I tried numerous times to adjust but the camera was just too temperamental.  It's a shame because I really liked the camera other than that one flaw.  I've read about random AF issues with the latest Canon HS cameras.  I guess you just have to get lucky and get a good one.  As for me, my search for a compact super zoom replacement continues.""
"20120404","5.0","My favorite camera ever!","I have been using Canon digital cameras since 2005, after many years of using Pentax SLRs. My hands are small, I am left-handed, and as one reviewer said somewhere, there is a great 'Canony' feel and user-friendliness to them. I also NEED an optical viewfinder, which many other manufacturers did not include with their digital point and shoots, because most of my personal photography is outdoor. (Hopefully in the sun.) I still keep my little SD 1000 in my purse at all times, just in case!Anyway - at the end of 2010, Canon also had dropped its optical viewfinders on all but it's higher end cameras. So, with promises of an easy to read display, and a good bridge-type of zoom, I tried an SX 130. Good camera, but I really missed my optical viewfinder. Also had purchased a Panasonic high-def camcorder that did not have an optical viewfinder. After almost 2 years of giving these a fair chance, I got an email from Amazon about the SX40 HS, and started researching and dreaming about it.Finally bought from Amazon in February, 2012. I have used it on trips and on local birds and more. It is my favorite camera since my old A95, and of course I like the SX 40 HS even better due to the optical zoom capability. Amazing night and low light photography! Excellent high def video that is beautiful on a high def TV. I know that some people have complained that it only uses .jpeg files, and long-term I may miss this. However, I have found that I've used the .jpeg for about 95% of my digital photo needs over the past few years, and haven't needed anything else since I retired. Thank you Amazon and Canon for my perfect camera""
"20120402","5.0","far exceeded expectations","Bought the camera for a trip to Kenya; 12 days and 1600 pics later (and 30 minutes of HD video), three people have said they're going to buy THIS camera based on the quality of my pics.Amazing image stability feature, as I took some pics at full digital zoom without a tripod and the pics turned out perfectly.Other people on the safari noticed the ease of use of the camera, as I was getting lots of shots while they were still trying to figure out how to work theirs. And 99% of the time I just left it on AUTO.The only critical comment would be that the image write time is a bit longer than I expected, which affects the ability to take the next photo. I had it on the 'M2' setting, 1900x1200, where each pic is about 1 MB, and was using a Sandisk Ultra 32 GB mini card.

"20120331","5.0","Phenomenal! (from a non-expert)","I've purchased between 5 and 10 digital cameras over the years but have less and less time to use them as I get older so I have a much harder time comparing this camera with what is available today.This is also my most expensive camera yet so presumably I'd be happier with it than anything previous. None-the-less I've got say there are a few qualities of this camera at which I marvel. The zoom, of course, is one. Seeing the craters on the moon, or the pupils of the eyes of birds shot at great distance... those were impressive! The image stabilization was as well. For the moon pictures I was fully zoomed (all the way through the digital range) and had only propped my elbows on a support--I did not use a tripod--and the image was sharp! I found macro shots of flowers to be exceptional as well. At the same time I recognize that a pro may not have been nearly as impressed as me, so remember--these are the impressions of an amateur.I do admit that pictures taken when fully zoomed are just usable as shot. Further zooming on the pc does not yield more detail or a more appealing picture. And the sharpness of the detail does trail off when fully zoomed, but some camera-knowledgeable friends had warned me that this is typical when shooting at high zoom levels.I won't say that even most of my macros or zooms were sharp, either--a good number were a bit out of focus. But the fact that SOME of them were means that the camera is capable and the user needs more practice.The one feature that I was not crazy over is where the camera tries to guess what you want to focus on and puts a box around it on the screen. Too often it guessed incorrectly and I had to move the camera around until it would focus on my chosen subject.""

I was filming from the mezzanine, in low light, and the HD video came out great.  The only drawback is that the controls aren't very intuitive and it takes a little time to figure them out.  Once you get the hang of it, it is an easy camera to use.  This is a camera for someone who wants to upgrade from a point-and-shoot.  This is probably not a good fit for someone who prefers a DSLR.Pros:  Long zoom lens, good picture quality, good video quality, easy to use, not too heavy.Cons:  You need to play around with it initially to get used to the controls; not a camera for the sophisticated photographer.""

It had to have swivel screen. I was hoping for a video recording camera too This Canon fulfills it all. THe indoor pix are great including without flash. Of course not as sharp as the true SLRs since this is NOT an SLR despite its size. The zoom is excellent. the Video quality is excellent too as is its audio. The only down side is that if you take a picture while video'ing, the video will have a pause in it.  I am really impressed with this camera.

The Canon SX40 HS is the answer for many who want to get more serious, but maybe the bulk or price of a true dSLR doesn't fit your needs. In many (and most cases) this camera not only fills the gap, it will leave you not even wanting a true dSLR. This coming from a man that owns a Nikon D7000 with 3 detachable lenses and hundreds of dollars in accessories. I also own a Canon SX20is which is 2 years old as of this writing, but a camera that I still grab if I want to not worry to much about technical shooting and want to worry more about composition and maybe add some artistic flare with it's many cool functions.No, the Canon is not a detachable lens dSLR.  It is a full body 'bridge camera' that does more in many instances of what a dSLR camera can do for the average person but maybe a bit less than what a professional would want done to their pics.  Of course a professional would need thousands of dollars in lenses and a photoshop program to match some of the functions this camera can do.  This camera is top in it's class amongst bridge style camera's in picture quality and shooting side by side with the Nikon Cool PIx direct competition proved what I had thought all along. (Again this coming from a Nikon d7000 owner). Canon plain and simple owns the high end bridge camera market in my opinion.Zoom is a big seller and many are disappointed when they hit the dSLR market and see the price of even a modest Zoom lens. Considering a low end 200mm lens for a dSLR is about the price of this entire camera, I can see why some skip the dSLR market altogether and would want something like this.  The average person would never be able to afford the zoom this camera offers on a dSLR.Quality usually goes down when zoom is involved as well. Ask any camera buff to test this baby out.  They will be amazed. Im not saying it's the equivalent of a f2.8 200mm or 500mm lens professionals use, but it's not bad and this entire camera weighs less than most 300mm dSLR lenses do and a 10th of what a 500mm lens would.  The detractors of my comparison, I'm sure, will mutter some mumbo jumbo about how the f-stop is too high on these super zoom cameras and that there is no way they can get as much quality as their $5000-$10000 outfit.  It may be so when comparing many technical aspects, but what I like is flat out results, not what some technical guru is telling you. And I LOVE the results of the testing I've put this camera through.  For the money, for the weight of this unit and all else, I will stand behind my claim thatThis camera has a 35X optical zoom (WITH an incredible 140X digital zoom) that produces images better than I could ever have imagined (even compared to my 80x zoom on my sx20...so big improvements in technology there!). It has an optical stabilization of which I am totally impressed with considering you can freehand a zoomed in pic at 140 digital zoom (35x optical) and get impressive pics. The zoom doesn't seem to suffer from lack of resolution or light gathering capabilities either in daylight hours.. On one particular extremely overcast day my wife took a picture of the trans-allegheny lunatic asylum in Weston, WV clock tower from the fence at the street and it filling the frame completely (and then some) with no motion and beautiful resolution. Considering at full zoom the 35mm equivilant is 840mm (can you imagine the price of THAT lens for a dSLR) I found this impressive. You could see the paint peeling off the clock face she got so close! We were a good 300 yards from it.Size is manageable as well. Smaller than any dSLR. It's not slim like a pocket camera, but it isn't bulky like a dSLR either. Its a 'best of both worlds hybrid camera' that any camera enthusiast would be proud to have in their arsenal. In addition the video on this camera rivals any consumer HD camera available. I use my sx20 for my youtube videos and consistently get complimented on image quality. The sx40 has now further 'upped the ante' (from my sx20) and bumped up quality to a full 1080HD video WITH autofocus (which even the best dSLR cameras cannot rival to this date). Considering video cameras have typically low res photo taking quality, it would make sense to buy this as your video camera AND you get awesome 12MP picture quality in addition.OK, so thus far you may think I have elevated this to God status. I realize it's faults. I know it's shortcomings. Thus the reason I own my Nikon d7000.A true dSLR has advantages. Manually focusing pictures is so much easier(I wouldn't even bother with manual focus with this camera), lower f-stops (with the correct lens, which btw are very expensive), wide angle shots (again, expensive lense) and the ability to crank out 3200ISO pictures with decent quality are the 3 that come to mind immediatly. The art of pulling together a beautiful picture that you can truly call your own, with a combination of technical expertise and composing can be more fully realized with a dSLR detachable lens type camera. But for the average person looking at your pictures and seeing the end result, most all but the most arogant camera snobs would say 'who cares' [lol]. Again, this coming from a man that owns an amazing Nikon dSLR.For the amateur enthusiast who wants to 'up their game' (without the expense of a magnum camera), dabble with manual settings and experiment with various picture options like fish eye lens, color swapping/enhancing, super-vivid color saturation option in addition to having the capability to get high quality video all within one carry around camera (without the bag) and so much more...I will HIGHLY recommend this camera to anybody that is looking for a camera but not quite wanting to reach into the expensive dSLR market.Highly recommended accessory ($10 in a few stores here on Amazon) would be the conversion ring that allows the use of 58mm filters so that you can dabble with polarizing and ND filters to further enhance your photography.  This camera does not allow the use of standard dSLR camera filters, you need this conversion ring to allow filters to be screwed on properly.""
"20120317","5.0","great camera","This is a great camera.......I purchased a Nikon L110 during a black friday sale and was only about 50% happy with it......sold it and wanted to go back to a Canon but did not want to spent all the money on a Rebel.........this camera is the big bang for the buck.  Takes excellent pics everywhere....from outdoors to low light inside. The zoom is nothing short of amazing!! I will love this camera for many years to come.""
"20120313","5.0","awesome camera","This camera is incredible! It's like nothing is out of range. With the 35x optical zoom, you can even take cool pictures of the moon. The shutter speed is really fast. It has a very fast shutter speed which is great for action shots. Nature shots are clear and the colors are accurate. I can't say enough how good this camera is. I got it when Amazon was having a sale which saved me quite a bit of money. If interested, check daily. The prices always fluctuate, and maybe you can get a good deal like I did.""
"20120313","5.0","Great Camera through Amazon","This camera is very easy to use right out of the box.  It came with a nice set of gagets and extra battery. The zoom is pretty amazing. Although the camera is capable of higher functions, it is also simple enough for anyone to begin taking great pictures.""
"20120307","5.0","Absolutely the best camera I've ever had.....","This is the most amazing camera.  I've had them all, over the past 50 years i.e., Nikon, Leica and other Canons... This camera not only does it all, but does it all very, very well.  Image quality is truly amazing, even at full zoom. There's only one fly in the ointment i.e., the 'Control Dial'... it is very light and easily moved... it is continuous, having no detents.  I'm forever moving it, accidently. It should be harder to move and have detents so you will know when you're moving it. Otherwise, it's a great 'do it all' camera, especially for such a very reasonable price... a lot of camera for the money.  It's a real shame that Canon does not provide a printed User's Manual i.e., you just get that on a CD. You can get a very nice bound, printed version from Old Timer Camera (www.otcworld.co.uk). It costs $22.10 plus $2.65 postage. This is in U.S. Dollars...  I did that and think it's very nice...not to mention handy to have with you, when away from your computer. This camera has so many features that it takes a while to get familiar with all that it does.. I've had mine for a couple of weeks and still learning something new almost every day. I almost never give (5) stars to anything, but have no reservations about doing so with this item...""
"20120307","5.0","Nice camera!","I have not had the opportunity to use this camera very much, but so far it seems like a nice little unit.....simple to use and takes crisp photos. I'll do a follow-up review after I'm able to use it in a variety of situations.""
"20120306","4.0","Wonderfully versatile camera with a few limitations","I have owned and used the SX40 HS extensively for a full month now, and I am continuously delighted with the variety of shots I can capture without having to lug around multiple lenses and other gear. Let's start though with what you should and shouldn't expect out of this camera. Expect that the immense 35x zoom will allow you to take sharp photos your old camera couldn't even dream of capturing: close-ups of birds in flight, pleasing portraits, spectacular photos of the moon, and crystal clear flower and wildlife photos in colors that are very true to life. What you shouldn't expect though no matter how much you want it to be so: dslr quality images; especially if you are filming fast-action sports. The CMOS sensor on the SX40 is 6.17mm x 4.55mm whereas sensor sizes on typical APS-C sensors are around, let's say ~23.6mm x 15.7mm. I have never owned a dslr in my life, but I have seen the differences that the much larger (much much larger) sensors on those cameras can make. This isn't a dig on the SX40! Truly artistic and beautiful photos can come out of this camera, but just know that you will not get that sense of serious professional refinement and (dare I say) feeling that cameras with larger sensors will provide. The only truly aggravating image quality quirk is the propensity for highlights to be blown out. In areas of bright sun all you see sometimes is shiny white blur with no detail whatsoever. Lowering the exposure balance a notch or two usually corrects this but can lead to darker photos than you might want.This camera fit my specifications as well as I could hope while trying to stay within a (relatively) modest budget. For me this was a huge step up from my Olympus Tough rugged point-and-shoot (so I am no Canon fanboy), but at the same time was not an overwhelming step in terms of learning to use the camera. While all the buttons and wheels may seem daunting at first, the layout is rather intuitive and anything you can't set with the push of a dedicated button can be accessed by browsing through the simple menu system. One of my favorite things off the bat was to make custom settings for the styles I use most often. You can save these settings to either C1 or C2 on the mode dial for quick access. The 35x zoom is NOT excessive. In fact, I find myself going out to the telephoto end every single day and loving it. Perhaps the best feature of the camera is just how stable the telephoto shots are. The in-body stabilization is truly extraordinary. It has to be said though that in video mode the stabilization at extreme zooms will cause strange wobbling (think rubber pencil trick) if you move the camera too quickly to keep up with the action. The fully articulating lcd screen is a huge plus as well. Even if you're not used to it you will want to start bending it around as it allows you to stay much more comfortable when composing awkward shots. Battery life is also very adequate for me. On my several-hour-long hikes I will take upwards of two or three hundred photos and a few short videos with no fear whatsoever of low battery. If you take long videos or plenty of high-speed bursts though for things like sports photography you will see the battery drain more quickly.One sneaky thing about this camera is how it has coaxed me into growing as a photographer. On my older cameras I always stuck to P (program) mode and let the camera decide what was best for each shot. The more and more I use the SX40, the more I have been using manual (M) mode to add control and complexity to my photos. I've learned through trial and error that f/2.7 makes for a blurrier background than f/8.0. I have learned how to post-process my photos to draw out the most from each exposure. The versatility of the camera continually makes me want to push my limits and step out of my comfort zone in order to capture truly spectacular shots. What more could you ask for in a camera?Let's talk about a few of the complaints about this camera, namely that shutter speeds only go as slow as 15 seconds and that there is no RAW capability. Firstly I want to say that the DIGIC 5 processor does a fantastic job on the very fine JPEG setting. You will be hard pressed to capture more quality with less noise in RAW format.  Also, you really need to check out CHDK (Canon Hack Development Kit) which I have been using with great success for 3 weeks now. CHDK is a program that sits on your SD card and doesn't directly modify anything in your camera. It shouldn't even void your warranty (though I'm no lawyer). The program allows you to squeeze every last drop of performance out of your hardware. Shutter speed can be overridden to as long as 2,048 seconds! That's over half an hour! I haven't tried anything over 64 seconds though so use at your own risk. RAW images can also be saved with CHDK installed. The only truly unfixable issues are the physical/hardware limitations.Physical/hardware limitations, and yes there are a few. I mentioned earlier that highlights really get blown out sometimes. This can for the most part be fixed by shooting in RAW with CHDK and fixing them in a program like Gimp or Lightroom, but it's annoying that I have to spend the time to post-process to retrieve those highlights. Secondly, the autofocus kinda... sucks to be frank. Especially in low light situations, in manual mode, and at the telephoto end it has to search a bit more to find what you want it to find. Sometimes I just switch over to manual focusing which works better but is still rough due to the average quality of the electronic view finder and the only 230,000 dot liveview lcd screen. Some of the shots just don't want to come out in focus. The camera is also relatively slow in between photos, CHDK or not.To conclude, I believe that this camera is a fantastic fit for most casual to semi-serious nature, portrait, and still-life photographers who want excellent color replication, image quality, and zoom without breaking the bank. The advantage of traveling with this camera in a small bag slung over your shoulder versus pounds and pounds of dslr equipment cannot be overstated either. Perhaps the best advice I can give is that you shouldn't fret for hours over camera review websites comparing noise levels of 100% cropped images at 1600 ISO or you will never spend less than $1,000 on a camera. Go to a camera store and get the camera in your hands and play around with it. If you have reasonable expectations about how the camera will perform, then I think you will be thrilled to choose the SX40 HS.Without question I am in love with this camera, but that doesn't mean I refuse to acknowledge its limitations. I would love in two years or so to see an upgrade to this line as I will almost surely jump right on it.""
"20120304","5.0","Love this camera!","The Canon SX40HS is a fantastic camera. The 35x zoom is great for wildlife photos. I was going to purchase a DSLR and then saw this one. I would have spent so much more buying camera and lenses. Also this fits in my purse so I have it with me at all times. I love all  the cool effects it has like the low light, fish-eye, color swap, etc. The quality of the photos are great. It's easy to hold and the vari-angle LCD works well for different photo situations. I am so pleased with this camera.""
"20120301","5.0","Absolutely awesome","This camera has so many bells and whistles, I am not sure which ones to use.  However, it far exceeded my expectations.  I would totally recommend this camera and Amazon as the supplier.  It is well worth the price.  Received it as expected and in perfect condition.""
"20120301","3.0","Undecided","After reading lots of reviews, I purchased this camera.  Pictures are good.  In sports mode all pictures came out blurry.  Video is excellant but the software that came with camera will only let you made CD not DVD. When trying to view video using other software, the sound is ahead of the video. Over all I like the camera except for the video incapabilities.""
"20120227","5.0","Great camera for the price","My GF and I went back and forth on buying a camera for a long time.  We wanted to get into photography but did not want to spend a ton of money on an SLR plus lens.  We were looking into top of the line P&S but I just wanted something more.  Then I found the Canon SX40HS.  I read / watched reviews online and said, 'f it, were getting it.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The camera takes amazing pictures and plenty of settings for all types of shooting.  I am still learning to shoot in raw so I cannot comment on manual settings, but shooting in Auto takes very nice pictures.  They are not the quality of a 60D, or T3i, but then again, this camera costs hundreds less and the zoom is amazing.  The only thing I dislike about the camera is the quality of the screen in back.  Bit fuzzy when you take the picture, but it comes out amazing when I download them to my mac.  I would recommend this camera for someone who wants to learn photography and does not want to spend 800-1000 on an SLR.""
"20120226","5.0","SX 40 HS Canon","I am very happy about that images come out clear and share.Recording button is easy to push.  Handling zoom dial takes a little to get used to, but once learning it, it effectively works.Nice to have an option of review and erase if needed. Could give more intuitive, descriptive icons on arrows and dial signs like Apple products.""
"20120222","5.0","That was amazing","WOooow, I've just received mine couple of days back and guess what I couldn't be happier, I bought the SX 40 as an upgrade to my sx 30 of which i got 5 months back, the SX 30 was amazing by the way, my only comment on it was the speed of 1.3 FPS, well this might be ok but not for me i'm  a father of a on year old angel and she's moving pretty fast at least faster than 1.3 fps, so after I read almost all of your reviews (thanks a million by the way) i made up my mind to get the sx 40 and I can say me decision was completely right, the cam is just wonderful not to mention the amazing speed of it's burst mood, the continuous shooting mood is doing a great job as well, i can see a lot of improvement in terms of depth of colors, night shooting is woow, for me and after trying the Fuji HS20 and the nikon P510 and the SX30 I can say the Canon SX40 HS is exactly what i was looking for. ease of use, fast start up and fast shooting.bottom line 'for a point and Shoot Camera I think that SX40 HS has really raised the bar way too high for the competitors'""
"20120220","5.0","One word... AMAZING!","Ok... I spent 3 months trying to decide what route I needed to go in with my next camera purchase. I wanted to make sure that I would be more than satisfied. I looked at the Canon t2i, t3i, and the Nikon D3000. I finally decided to look online for the latest reviews on new cameras. The first review was for the Canon sx40 HS. At that moment I was hooked. I now have a camera that was under $400, capable of most everything that a DSLR can do, and it's a Canon. I really had the mind set that I was going to get a DSLR, but I didn't like the idea of having hundreds of dollars tied up in lenses alone, but sx40 HS having the 35x zoom, you have a camera that can literally reach the stars. On another note, I have a Sony Handycam digital camcorder, but I won't be using it anymore. The Canon sx40 HS shoots video in 1080p. Since my initial purchase of the camera, I have added a UV lens, a circular polarized filter, and a set of Macro lenses.Pros... everythingCons... I have to sleep sometimeI would highly reccomend this camera to anyone who wants to go beyond the simple point and shoot concept.""
"20120220","3.0","Great and Not So Great","I've been using Canon cameras for over 30 years and have loved every one of them, from video to professional SLR to compact digital.  The SX super zoom cameras have proven to be a convenient alternate choice to carrying an SLR with an array of lenses.  The SX40 is outstanding in picture quality and has probably the longest zoom lens in its field.  I would normally have given this camera a 5 star rating if not for a few disappointments in this version.  Most annoying is the hissing sound that occurs when zooming while shooting a movie.  It ruins every movie where ambient noise is minimal.  Don't know what happened with Canon because this was not a problem in earlier models.  The other disappointment is no wireless remote capability.  Canon chose to add this feature to a few of its previous cameras, but it is not on the SX40.  Wireless remote has come in handy many times for me.  If you can live with these deficiencies, you've got an awesome camera.  Otherwise, I would suggest the Canon SX1 IS, if you can still find it.  The zoom is only 20x,  but still outstanding . . . and quiet!  And it does have wireless remote capability.""
"20120219","5.0","Canon SX40 HS Digital Camera","I am most impressed with the picture quality and the enormous zoom of this camera. No problems whatsoever with this camera so far. I was predominantly looking for a camera to take wildlife pictures in various lighting conditions and distances. This camera does all I was expecting and a lot more in superb quality. It is a good compromise for all customers looking for feature variety, a great zoom, but do not want to go all the way and purchase a digital SLR camera. The Canon SX40 HS is still easy enough to operate for the typical point-and-shoot user, but offers a lot more possibilities, when the manual adjustment possibilities of this camera will be used. For its price, I believe, it's one of the best choices out there on the market right now.""
