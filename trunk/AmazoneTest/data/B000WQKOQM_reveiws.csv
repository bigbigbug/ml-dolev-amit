So after doing some investigating and looking for the best price/space ratio, I decided upon this card.I have always bought SanDisk products since they always work.  The DSi accepts all SD and SDHC cards, so you won't have to worry about that compatibility issue.  Since I am only looking to use the card to store pictures and downloaded games form the DSi Shop, I didn't need extra space for music.No matter the size of your SD card, the DSi can only store 3,000 pictures on a card, so don't buy an extra large card for that purpose.That said, this 4GB card equals 9,999 'Blocks' on the DSi.  Current downloadable apps range from ~60 to 140 blocks, so use that as a scale in deciding what size will be futureproof for you.  The internal system memory of the DSi is just over 1,000 blocks.  For under $10,and shipped by Amazon, this card is a no brainer for the new DSi owner.""

Unfortunately, based on the description on the Amazon website, I bought it for my Canon PowerShot camera thinking it would provide  greater storage for more video clips. Only when I installed it and got the message that there was an error reading the card, did I realize this card wasn't meant for this camera. Then I plowed through the owner's manual and discovered the camera was only capable of using cards up to 1 GB. So this was not a fault of the card but the product description which stated it could be used in digital cameras. Perhaps a sentence could be included; 'works with some digital cameras; check with manufacturer.' Now don't beat me up because I was too dumb to do the checking first. I'm still not sure why my camera couldn't use the additional memory (After all, it fit in the slot) but fortunately J&R took it back.""

I fully recommend this product to anyone who uses alot of space on their memory cards quickly: it will be well worth the money. Be forewarned, however: this memory card only works in HC-compatible devices, so older digital cameras may not pick it up.

I can't imagine what happened here, but keep your guard up and save yourself some money. By the way, I did manage to save over $25.00 by calling customer service for a refund of a price being lowered within a thirty-day period of purchase, especially during this holiday season.  Conversely, they will raise the price on a hot seller, too.  Keep checking back on previously bought merchandise to see if Amazon has lowered the price within your thirty day period; you'll find it's worth your time, and I have to applaud Amazon for being very gracious and prompt in doing so.""

The SD cards have really come down in price and you can get a big card for very cheap, which is great and I would recommend getting the bigger memory card to anyone. However, now the cards are of a higher technology than our plasma TV, which is about 5 years old. We have a SD card reader in the TV and this card can not be read by our TV, as well as the card reader on our friend's printer, so I guess I am stuck using my older, smaller memory memory card until we get a new TV.

"20110601","4.0","Works great for most uses, if super speed is not an issue","I've purchased two of these so far--one for a digital picture frame, and one for my digital camera, and both work very well for me. To date I've had no problems with the memory, and it continues to work like new. You are able to save pictures, video, and possibly other things as well on these devises. They can be written to just like hard discs and come in very handy. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because it seems to load a little slowly when transitioning between images or when you are accessing it on a computer or camera. A friend recently informed me that all of these memory chips have numbers written inside a circle that looks like a letter 'C' on the front. Apparently the higher the number, the faster the chip can process, or at least that's what I was told. So, if you don't mind waiting a couple extra seconds for images to load or transitioning to take place, this is a great product and works very well for a plethora of uses. If a few seconds' wait time is going to bother you, it might be wise to purchase a more expensive memory device at a little higher price that has a higher number on the front of the chip.""

The first thing I did was hurry up and open them so I can put them in my phone. I must have been looking at one for over an hour trying to see where the micro sd card was. I thought BINGO, Look at the packaging. I did, there it was it was a flash for laptop or camera. I felt so dumb for a few minutes. I then thought it was an honest mistake.
