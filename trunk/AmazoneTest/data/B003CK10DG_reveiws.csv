"20120603","2.0","Be cautious...","Floated well in the ocean, and the bright yellow color helped me find my Nikon AW100 after dropping it into the water.  However, the strap conncting the float to the camera is extremely fragile.  Mine broke shortly after returning to the boat - I'm sure it could have just as easily failed in the water, but I was lucky.I would not recommend using unless the float can be more securely attached to the camera.  One way might be to loop the camera manufacturer's strap through the actual float, rather than using the strap provided by Chums.""

Unfortunately, the camera was not as waterproof as claimed, it leaked and died, so we have not used the strap very much.However, it did a good job of floating the camera to the surface if you released it underwater,  and it floated with enough of the bright yellow strap out of the water so its easy to find the camera.  Additionally, the strap was small enough to be comfortable to use, and not so buoyant as to be hard to handle when underwater.I liked the quick release between the main strap and the loop that attaches to the camera.  It was easy to use, and feels secure when latched.Unfortunately, we did not get to use the strap very much due to the camera failure, so we cannot say how well it will hold up in the long run.""

When I took it out of the package, I wasn't sure if it would work well for me because I have fairly thin wrists. However, while it is quite loose on my wrist, I never once had any fear of losing it. It would always catch on my hand because of this sort of rubbery yellow material that covers the float.I took it into a wave pool, down water slides, tubing on the lake and it worked like a dream even in the rough water. It was accidentally knocked into the deep end of a swimming pool, and it was so much easier to retrieve a bobbing on the top of the water camera, than one that had sunk to the bottom.I would highly recommend this to anybody who needs a comfortable wrist float to keep their camera safely with them around water.""

We went to a snorkel and Sea Trek tour, and I always tied this item along with my camera. It fits to an adult wrist perfectly. Even carrying under water around 30 feet, it floats but it doesn't bother my wrist movement. I never really released the camera from my wrist; so, I cannot tell you if it is going to float above water if an accident happens, and I kind of not want to try either :). If you are going to swimming pool, this might be unnecessary, but if you are going to under water or lake something, I would recommend this item and always ties with your camera.""

"20110606","4.0","Camera Float","Very good product ... got to test it during my sea dive last May 31st both at the surface and about 11 meters down.  Let the camera go and it starts to float upwards.  Great yellow color (suggest adding some neon colors to product line) for visibility underwater and for surface retrieval.  Every small underwater camera (or any small gadget you do not want to sink) should have one.  One improvement I would recommend to the manufacturer - improve the lanyard connector locking mechanism & material both in the twist-off 'locking design' and material 'hefty-ness', because it could give way if snagged against dive gear.  Thanks.""
"20110603","4.0","Great reassurance for waterproof cameras","I have had some sort of waterproof camera for 5 years now, and have only been using the provided straps that have come with the cameras. While they are very good for keeping the camera strapped to you, they provide no protection if you happen drop the camera while passing it off to someone or you end up getting the strap and camera caught in your gear while putting on a lifejacket, etc.With this chums float, you can take a few pictures then just let the camera go in the water while you are messing with your gear, and it will still be around when you are finished and ready to go again.It is nice that they have a quick disconnect, but I am not fully convinced that the chums strap's connection is strong enough to withstand a lot of pressure, so I have been doubling up and using the tougher strap that came with my camera as well.Another useful thing I have found with this strap is that you can tuck your camera between it and your arm if you are needing to use your arms a lot (this came in handy while climbing up waterfalls in the Dominican Republic). That way it is softly cushioned up against your body and out of the way of smacking rocks like it would be if it were just dangling from your wrist.""
"20110523","5.0","It floats a GoPro","The Chums waterproof camera float works great for a GoPro HD. It was a little larger than expected but the size works out great to slip over your wrist in or out of the water. Several times I found myself stuffing the camera inside my pocket to swim 'camera free' and not having to fiddle with velcro or clips is a big plus. It was easy to swim with the wrist strap on and camera in hand down to 20' or so and the float easily brought the GoPro back to the surface when 'freed'. Also it was a bonus always being able to find the camera with the bright yellow strap attached. Whether stuffed in a pocket or free floating it is quick to locate.""
"20110522","5.0","Works great with the Pentax Optio WG-1 GPS","This is a simple product that works.  The yellow color is visible in the water.  Without the strap, the camera sinks to the bottom, with the strap, the camera stays close to the top.  I was worried the weight of the camera would be too much for the strap, but the strap stays 1/2 above the water.  There's a quick twist release that allows you to remove the yellow handle when you are not using it in the water.  I have both the camera strap that came with the camera and this one together.  The yellow strap fits comfortably around my wrist.  I guess the only enhancement to this strap would be an adjustable collar that would allow the user to tighten or loosen the wrist strap depending on the size of their wrist.""

"20120419","1.0","Broke within seconds out of the package","I just made this purchase for an underwater camera I bought for the cruise I am taking in 3 days.  Within seconds out of the package, my girlfriend gave a very light tug on the black connector that's sewed to the strap as it doesn't look very secure and the entire thing pulled right out.  Now, I have to admit I read the reviews prior to my purchase and was very skeptical with all of the bad reviews stating this similar issue and I can assure you that they are all entirely true.  I bought it with the idea that in the worst case I would just loop my existing camera strap around the floating wrist strap and this will suffice for my needs.  It was a struggle to find any floating camera strap with a good review.  I can't understand how a manufacturer can continue to produce a product with such a poor quality.  The device is supposed to be designed to hold a camera floating in the water and the manufacturing of the product comes nowhere close to accomplishing this in the least.  If you purchase this product, be aware you will have to modify the stitching to support the camera and be mindful of the black, quick connect piece as it feels like it could break easily.  Be sure to wrap your existing camera strap around the float itself as caution or you will lose your camera under water.  Amazon should pull this product from its listing immediately until the manufacturers produce at least something that could pass as a quality product.  clearly there was absolutely zero testing done on this product before mass production.""

So I was left with a yellow floating wristband...and no camera.  I went back toward shore where I suspected it became disconnected at and snorkeled along the shore line where I had put my flippers on at.  Fortunately, when  a gentleman saw me doing this, he asked, 'Are you just snorkeling here or are you looking for something?'  I showed him my camera-less floating wristband and told him I was searching for my camera.  He then proceded to pull my camera out of his pocket and returned it to me.  I am very thankful that honest people still exist and do acts of kindness for strangers.  To remedy the problem, I took off the connector portion of the wristband, attached the Chums armband to my camera with the wrist strap that came with my camera.

Just make sure to test it in shallow water to make sure that it will float your camera in the water you plan on swimming in. This works great for snorkeling.""
"20111005","5.0","GREAT STRAP","This strap is awesome!  I almost purchased one of the other listed on Amazon, but after reading some of the other reviews how they don't fit your wrist properly backed out.  Selected this one and am glad I did.  Fits like a glove and the quick disconnect is handy!""
"20111004","1.0","Came with no attachment string","I had read in reviews that the string on this item often breaks after I had already ordered.  When I opened it today there wasnt even an attachment string included in packaging.  I just threw it away.""
"20110930","5.0","Awesome","This float is a good way to hold onto your camera and also like that it is detachable.  Haven't floated it in water yet.""
"20110929","5.0","camera float","Tried it out at the weekend for the first time and it worked. Its a good color to spot in the water aswel.""
"20110927","5.0","Worked great on vacation","Worked very well, yellow easy to see, I have big hands and was still able to slip it on. Allowed me to snorkle without having to worry about where the camera was. One nice feature is that the float disconnects at plastic coupler, allowing you to leave base piece attached to camera and quickly put on or take of the float.""
"20110924","5.0","Works great!","Items works just as intended.  My son bought a waterproof Kodak camera and bought this strap to go with it.  We tested it out by tossing the camera and strap into our pool, and it keeps the camera right at the top of the water.  Yes, the strap is large and pretty cumbersome and you will need to take it off to put your camera in your pocket, but it does the job well, and is bright and easy to see.  Water does get into the strap a bit and you might want to ring it out before putting it somewhere you don't want to get wet, just as an FYI.""
"20110924","5.0","Works!","We bought this for our Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS10 waterproof camera. To make a long story short, the camera did in fact fall from a canoe and, lo and behold, the strap kept it afloat. Must have for any waterproof camera, I would say. Comfortable too.""
"20110921","5.0","Floats a Canon D10","Bought this for a trip to mexico with a under water camera Canon D10 and it worked great, has a clip that detaches it when not needed. Very useful.""
"20110920","1.0","Strap broke... lost camera in lake","Bought a Panasonic underwater camera for our cruise to Mexico and bought this strap to go along with it.  Took a bunch of pictures and when we got back, we went to a lake party but I did not get a chance to download the pictures off the camera before we went to the party.  At the lake, I was floating around with the camera strapped to my wrist and next thing you know, the strap broke and the camera went to the bottom (around 25-30ft deep).  Tried getting a diver out to look for it but was not able to.  Lost all our cruise pictures along with the camera!  Will not buy this strap again!""
"20110917","5.0","must have","We purchased this for a small Kodak waterproof digital camera. Of course it is a simple product but it is built well and was a great help in the water. I highly recommend this as a must have.""
"20110916","4.0","Item worked and did the job","Easily attached to the camera and fit on your upper arm without worry of losing the camera in the water.""
"20110911","5.0","Enough float for a DSC-TX10","It is a simple to use float w/ a nice quick release feature.  That's a nice plus because it can be tough to thread a wrist strap through the loop on the Sony DSC-TX10.  I've tested this out in a pool, and it floats w/ the loop popping out of the water.  When I dropped the camera into the water w/ the loop, it stopped it after going about 1.5' deep & quickly popped back up to the surface.""
"20110907","5.0","Does its job and then some...","After I lost a waterproof camera in the middle of a lake in July, we purchased this to go with our new waterproof camera. It is big and bright (which was a downside for my husband as we have a small case and the strap hangs out) which made it easy to find the camera in any location. (Plus side for me as I am always misplacing things. This is very bright and big and sticks out like a sore thumb! Great in my book! LOL) I have not tried this in the ocean yet, but we have tried it in pools and it floats our little Sony DX10 just great! We took it to Niagara Falls and the wrist strap was fantastic for Cave of the Winds and all the other water activities we tried!""
"20110902","5.0","I love my chum","This little device saved my camera and all my pictures from a 3 day ocean kayak trip when our kayak flipped during a hairy landing on the beach our last day. We flipped and I when I got to shore saw the yellow strap floating in the water and dove after it. The best $10 I've ever spent. It is also really nice that the floating strap detaches if needed to put it in a purse without the bulk of the strap.""
"20110829","5.0","Great product - works well","Color was perfect for viewing in the water, felt comfortable on wrist. Was able to swim comfortably with our underwater camera while snorkeling and not worry about dropping camera!""
"20110828","5.0","Best float for underwater cameras!","This little thing works great. It kept our camera afloat the whole time we were in the Cayman Islands. It's not big and bulky like alot of the other floats (especially the inflatable ones). I would Definetly recommend this one!""
"20110817","5.0","it really does float","I was a little hesitant that this would float with my waterproof camera attached, but it does.  It's bright color also makes it very easy to see while in the water.  A definite recommendation""
"20110812","1.0","Work as expected but broken after 14 days of use","I bought this with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 waterproof camera.  This product is fantastic.  I took the camera in a 21-day trip to the Olympic National Park and the Canadian Rockies.  The big yellow band is comfortable to wear and easy to recognize, both in and out of water.  The band does float the camera, even in the several hot springs we visited.  However, the thin thread that ties the big yellow floater to the camera broke after 14days.  The same one that comes as part of the camera has a much thicker thread.  I would think that a product that charges $10 should not cut corners on the material compared to the one that comes free with the camera.  Without this drawback I'd give 5 stars.""
"20110811","1.0","Cheap product, waste of $ 9.00","I was super excited with this product .. Used first time with my Panasonic Lumix and the yellow strap disconnected from the black part while I was pulling it out of my wrist. Do not waste your money ... totally useless!! garbage!!""
"20110804","3.0","Chums Floaty","The strap connected to the float broke off after one day of use. It was not sewn very well. I sewed it back on and it seems to be holding up. This is over priced for the quality of craftsmanship involved.""
"20110801","5.0","worked great","Used this float on my waterprooof camera on a canoe trip to Canada.  A little tricky fitting the loop around the camera but once attached it was excellent.""
"20110730","5.0","Chums Camera Float","I purchased this item for a cruise I am going on soon. It looks like it will be of good quality, the foam inside is thick and the nylon/neoprene cover should hold up nicely. I usually attach a mickey float key chain to my camera to make it stay above water, so I like that this one I can put on my wrist while in the water or boat and know that it will float. So far my only complaints are that the end of it that attaches to my camera is the same if not more flimsy of material that my last camera wrist strap that came with my camera and broke. So I'm wondering how long this one will last My second complaint is, being a female with skinny wrists I had to use a ziptie an inch from the bottom of the strap to make it fit my wrist. Otherwise I could put it up to my elbow. So for those of you with big wrists (like my 40yr old dad)are good!!""
"20110728","4.0","Don''t know yet","I have had the float for about a month.  It looks like it should work, but have not put it to the test yet.  I don't really want to put the camera in the water until I have to as dirctions say test it in the sink.  I'm assuming it will do what it has to do. Tested it on item of similar weight and it was fine.""
"20110725","5.0","Great item!","My Olympus Tough 6020 floated perfectly with the Chums Waterproof Camera Float.  Great item - gave me peace of mind while snorkeling in the Caribbean.""
"20110719","5.0","Great Camera Float","I've been using this float for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3.  I've spent probably five or six full weekends in oceans, lakes, and pools with my Chums attached and it works perfectly.  Great float, stays securely around my wrist at all times, I've never had any issue with it.  You can't go wrong with it, well worth the money.""
"20110713","5.0","Does the Job.  really Enjoy it","I use it for a Olympus Tough 3000.Works good. It is just enough to float.  The camera is in the water but you can see clearly the yellow strap.What I'm afraid of is that one day the thin cord that connects it to the camera will rip or the connect will break. And there goes the camera.  But I've used it 3 times already and it's worked good.""
"20110710","5.0","Floats like a charm!","This camera float works perfectly. I have taken it out to sea, snorkeling, in the pool. Its bright yellow with a reflective logo. Very useful if you are swimming around looking for it!""
"20110709","3.0","Coulda, Shoulda, been more heavy duty","Nice foam wrist band, good bright yellow color, would have rated higher if the nylon attachment cord was of a heavier guage/more durable stronger rating.""
"20110708","1.0","BROKE QUICKLY","I have had this for a little over a month and only have used it a couple times.  I picked the camera up today by the yellow strap and it broke at the point where the strap was sewn on to the black connector portion.  I would not recommend this product.""
"20110708","4.0","Works good","We bought to use with our Kodak Sport waterproof camera.  The strap was a little difficult to attach because the strap was barely long enough to loop back through itself to attach it to the side of the camera but with some manipulating, we got it through.  Otherwise, the strap works as expected.""
"20110707","4.0","It Floats!","It floats the Storm whistle. Yellow is easy to see in most water. I'm sure it'll float a disposable camera but have not tried it.""
"20110703","4.0","Very vissable well built.","Does the job. Having lost tools over the side on a sailboat it takes all the fear when running the river or on the sailboat.""
"20110630","4.0","Good product","Item arrived on time, looks good, but the connecting loop looks like it should be a little more sturdy however.....""
"20110630","2.0","Chums Waterproof Camera Float","I orginally purchased 2 of these.  One of them was fine the other had a broken string on it. I ordered another because I needed it quicker than trying to exchange it.  The 3rd one came and it did not have the attachment string for the camera.  We got around it by using strap of the camera to loop around the yellow handle instead and that worked great.  I was afraid to attached the one that did work since I have trouble with the other string.  The float works great but don't count on the string that fastens your camea to it to hold up.""
