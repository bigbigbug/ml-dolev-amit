A 16 GB from Sprint sells for $79 - owch. Prices weren't much better elsewhere especially when I started to look at the big guns - the 32GB cards.When I found them here on Amazon for a mere $22 I thought it can't be - the very best price I found was on a site that looked a bit shaky for $99.99 and that was on sale. Click - add to cart - buy.The cards which are incredibly tiny and arrive in sealed retail packaging, very carefully wrapped and shipped in a sturdy box.They're effortless to install and when I hooked the phone up to the computer to access the Sandisk site each card was authenticated immediately.The free software for organizing stored media was downloaded, the phone formatted the card in a nano second and that was that.The card comes with an adapter - which you use if your computer has a card reader. If not you should probably pick one up. The readers upload data much faster than if you use your phone.Be careful opening the package - there's a tiny strip of paper with your Sandisk password on it - you'll need that to register.The 32GB holds a massive amount of media, songs, photographs, movies - even books and magazines - they also lessen the work load on the CPU within the phone.Most Smart Phones will automatically switch over to the additional storage when they need to - so there is absolutely nothing to do, it's all done for you.Having a card is also a great way to back up anything you don't want to loose.We ended up with two 32 GB cards at half the price of a single 16GB card.Only on Amazon - I think I'm past asking how they do it.""

It has no bearing on the chips general performance or its ability to read and write information in a more random scattered manner like a phone or tablet would need.Sandisk products tend to excel in this area, and as a result can offer substantially improved performance in cameras, tablets and other devices that use a memory chip more like a disk drive and less like a recording medium.As a result, you can buy a class 4 or 6 sandisk product and except for applications like HD video recording, it'll outperform many class 10+ cards.Do a search for microsd cards and random read/write performance.  You'll see a variety of sandisk products in the upper part of the benchmark ratings.""
"20120410","5.0","Genuine SanDisk Media","Just received my class 4 32gb SanDisk microsd in two days with Prime.  Arrived in Amazon's hassle free packaging, small plastic bags with the card case inside.  No sd adapter is included with these so be aware of this if you do not already have one.  Upon opening my package I promptly did a 2.5gb file transfer, solid transfer speeds that never dropped below the 4 MBps that class 4's are supposed to get.  So I must say I am happy with my buy.  I strongly recommend to use only SanDisk for SD and MicroSD media.  I was in a pinch and needed one so I bought a 4gb maxell microsd from Kmart and the thing did not work right from day one, was getting like 1 MBps transfers, they would start out full speed and then die out, so be wary of the bargin brands, spend a few extra bucks for premium media if you want your data safe.""

"20120607","4.0","No Probs with my HTC Aria","I bought this for my HTC Aria 'Smart' (actually, just 'above avg') phone, and so far, it works.It hasn't brought down any government networks, hasn't called down an alien strike from outer space, and actually, it hasn't caused my little phone any issues (like slowing it any farther than it already crawls, or causing 'any more' lock-ups than it already had).This MicroSD looks to be the 'genuine article', and I'm at 'SUCH' an incredibly-consumer-level in buying this type of thing, that I'd look elsewhere for advice on it's speed, camera compatibility, etc.  All I know is that I replaced an 8GB MicroSD with this one, and now I can house my entire MP3 collection directly on my phone without having to 'stream' it.If you're an Aria owner (or perhaps some other phone owners experience this too), you can easily download the Android app called 'Gemini' and move all your downloaded apps over to your MicroSD to free up tons of space on your phone, to maximize it's 'potential', space-wise.  IMHO, that feature should have been automatic with Android 2.2, and esp. newer firwmare updates, but hey...it's not an iPhone, right?Anyway, tons of space, comparatively, to anything smaller, and room to download lots more apps (when using a good app util like 'Gemini').  I even had room to move around 10 of my favorite South Park classics from my DVD collection over to my phone (used another software package to convert 'em) and still have room for more.Heck, 32GB is enough to run Windows 7 at least once, so you gotta figure, this might be enough room for you.If not, then maybe you need to buy Cloud storage space with MIT or something.(WARNING: HOPEFULLY ONLY OTHER GEEKS WILL GET THIS WATERED-DOWN JOKE--'Noobs' should practice the same care in viewing this review as they would with NOT staring directly at the Sun during eclipses, 'Decent People', with watching a Nancy Grace marathon; 'Blondes', with staring at the mirror while saying 'Bell Witch' 3X).BUT SERIOUSLY: I paid $31.12 ($23.06 + $8.06 shipping), which is borderline on the lowest price I could find at the time (Apr. 7 '12), so keep that in mind.  They were likely available cheaper at the very moment, and now, should be even lower.  Don't be gouged.

Great card for mobile!","Be safe, and order DIRECTLY from reputable retailers like Amazon, Newegg, etc. Avoid 3rd party sellers and Ebay like the plague unless you want to take a huge chance of getting a counterfeit card.These Sandisk clas 4 cards are great for mobile OSes. Despite being Class 4, they generally offer magnitudes more performance when it comes to random read/write compared to competitors' Class 10 cards. When it comes to getting your phone or tablet working best, random transfer performance is the most important metric and not sequential transfers, which is what the Class of a card signifies. Class 10 cards might have a minimum of 10 MBps sequential transfer, but their random transfers are generally dismal.These Sandisk cards are the best in the world, hands-down, as far as reliability and performance goes. As such, they are heavily counterfeited. The counterfeits are physically identical to the real thing (after all, some plastic and screen-printed logos aren't hard to replicate). Once you use them though, you'll either see very poor performance, missing capacity, data corruption, or some combination of the three. You have to ask yourself how much is that trouble worth to you?

"20120313","5.0","Works perfectly!","I got this 32GB micro SD card for my Motorola Xoom. I wanted to store all of my music on it so I could get rid of my 300 CD player in my audio system. I ripped over 400 CD's to my PC and then synced them plus what I had in iTunes to the Xoom. It all fit (with 13GB to spare) on the SD card so I didn't use any of the internal data storage capacity and the SD card works fast and flawlessly.I have wanted to do this for years and the Xoom ($300 on Ebay) with the SD card is the perfect vehicle for me. I can scroll like a Juke Box through the album artwork by Album Title, Artist or Genre; make as many playlists as I like; search for any song; and take ALL my music with me wherever I go. It's amazing. It lives in the dock on top of my receiver and displays a customized photo slideshow 24/7.We have an iPad 2 but it's out of the dock too often to be used as a primary audio component. It also requires everything to go through iTunes on my PC and I hate iTunes. Both devices have the capability to use the Cloud, which I tried but didn't like. I also didn't like the Google Music app (pre-installed on the Xoom) so I purchased 'PlayerPro' from the Android App store.As for the $31 (with free shipping from Amazon) price tag of the SanDisk microSDHC Flash Memory Card, it's a real bargain compared to the $100 Apple charges to upgrade from the 32GB iPad to the 64GB unit. This card is also sold with an optional card reader but once the card is installed in the Xoom, it shows up as a device separate from the 'Xoom Internal Memory' in Windows Media Player so you can sync either to the Xoom Internal Memory or right to the SD card. The reader is handy for other applications and it is inexpensive so you may want to consider it, but it isn't needed with the Xoom.The sound quality to me is the same as the CD player I was using. I have read about separate Digital to Analog converters that go between the tablet and receiver, removing the unsophisticated converter built in to the tablet from the signal chain. I'll continue to investigate, but for now, I'm one happy camper.""

The card that I mentioned earlier with the same specs and name brand from NewEgg has an average transfer rate (write to) of 5.4 mbps, confirmed again.  I am giving this product 2 stars because it does actually work and it did arrive, but this card is performing at the Class 2 rates.""

Anyone who works with computers or technology in general knows that you will occassionally have a device that just fails.  I work a computer helpdesk and see it with hard drives all the time, it happens.  That's why any good manufacturer warrants their product, so if you have a failure like this, you get a new one.

While the seller listed has changed again (actually twice since I started typing this review), 'ChiTek Corp' were the ones who were listed when I ordered. The card came (along with a much larger item in a much larger box)in a small baggy that contained the card in a plastic SD storage holder. I tested the card with 'h2testw' which took nearly 2 hours, but provided the following results:Test finished without errors.You can now delete the test files *.h2w or verify them again.Writing speed: 4.22 MByte/sReading speed: 17.9 MByte/sH2testw v1.4Each of the 30 files was approx 1GB and show the slower write speed associated with larger files, though it does meet the class 4 specification for write speed which naturally varies by device anyway. I leave benchmarking to others as from most devices I have used even a 2 MB/sec is sufficient to do nearly anything I need. I was pleased with the price, the shipping speed despite being supersaver shipping it was very quick. Glad to say this card is genuine, which is really what I ran the check for. Now I am happy and off to fill the card.""

She ran out of memory on a 2GB card and then on an 8GB card because she takes a lot of pictures and videos of our boy.  This 32GB card should provide her some free space for a while.The phone has recognized all 32GB of the card's capacity and the card works fine.  I think the card is fast enough for this application.Nokia C6-01 keeps all apps and photos on the card becasue it has very limited internal memory. Prior to swapping the card I backed up the phone in hopes that after I install the new card I'll be able to run a restore procedure and all of the stuff will appear on the card.  I excluded pics and videos from the resore to save time and just copied them to my compter.  Well, I had an inkling that as usual with Nokia something may not work as expected, and indeed, after I installed the new card and ran the restore, only contacts, messages and calendar were restored.  Apps and navigation maps were not restored to the new card.  I had to re-download apps and maps,which took time.  However, all is well now.I tried to open the card's packaging without scissors, and it required some serious tearing and mawling with my teeth and nails.  The packaging is made of cardboard reinforced with plastic - a little too secure for this type of product, in my opinion.  I recommend using scissors.""

First, making sure the ID-tag had was real (it was), and then using F3 to time how long it took to fill up every byte of the 32 GB. I used a USB adapter (with an micro-to-SD adapter) as well as the PC's SD reader (again with a micro-to-SD adapter) on two separate PCs to double-check. The write-speed results ranged from 3.5 to 3.8 mb/s. A little low for SanDisk (the company usually exceeds its own speed ratings), but good enough for class-4.""

"20120121","1.0","Not sure if it is genuine","I received the sd card today and I was testing the speeds and it writes around 3.1 MB/s which doesn't even classify as a class 4 since they need to write at least 4.0 MB/s. And the reading speeds are just as worse, they are around 5.7 MB/s. Right now I am testing to see if this sd card is actually a 32GB and not some 4 gb or 16 gb class 2 Micro SD card rebranded as a San Disk 32GB class 4. I've also bought a Lexar 16GB class 10, it also was only about 6.7 MB/s for writing speeds and couldn't even hold a 5GB file.Lesson learned, Never buy SD cards or any form of flash memory (USB,SD card, Micro SD card, etc..) it's just not worth saving 5-10 dollars on a micro sd card. Most of these cards are hacked cards that say on windows 7 that they are 16gb or 32gb but they actually only can carry like 4 gb.""

All you get is a 'tamper proof' packaging wherein the 32GB microSDHC card is seen wrapped in a plastic slotted enclosure. Amazon ships this in a bubble wrapped media mailing envelope and arrived safely. Very Fast Shipping and earlier than expected! - Thanks Amazon!The advertised speed of Class 4 was not achieved in my tests with this card model number SDSDQM-032G. I did multiple tests in PC (Windows 7 32-bit) with a microSDHC adapter also in couple of MP3 players with built-in microSDHC slots, the maximum I could obtain was about 3.89 MB/s (Write)I read here on Amazon and elsewhere that certain users have got better read and write speeds, but that could very well be different batch from Sandisk or from different suppliers. Those people who have got those outrageous read and write speeds out of a class 4 card are really really lucky!I wish I had gotten a Class 10 speed as seen by others but that did not happen for me :-( - Oh! well...Overall, The price of this microSDHC card is just right (Hence 4 stars) and I am happy with the purchase from Amazon.""

For some reason there is a delay and it made me think I had a faulty card at first. I don't think the class of card matters at all if you are using this for phone storage. It did take about 2 hours to transfer around 24 gigs onto the card, but that is a one-time transfer. It was transferring (according to my PC) at 3.9mb/sec, but that was also transferring from an external USB harddrive through my computer to the sd card plugged into my phone.

(Counterfeiting and fake products are a real problem in the memory card industry from what I understand.)This is the real deal (bought from Amazon).  The reason it's inexpensive is that it's a class 4 card instead of the faster class 6 and class 10 cards.  If you're mostly using this for something like storing a music collection where you transfer the files once and don't need read and write speed all the time, then this is just fine.I tested the card with H2Test software and it contains the capacity it says and worked fine.  I now test all new cards with the h2Test software before using them to be sure they're legitimate.""
"20111228","5.0","Great Card","I purchased this card for my BB Torch 9810 since the 8GB filled up very quickly. I had the idea to get a Class 10 card, but after seeing the prices I changed my mind.  I read reviews on this card (class 4) and found out that for music, videos and document editing/viewing, a class 4 would be more than enough. I also read a review of someone who purchased a class 10 card and this SanDisk class 4 was actually faster that the class 10. So, I decided to purchase it. The supplier shipped it super-fast, and received it way ahead of the estimated arrival dates at the time of purchase (I am supposed to expect it in my hands beginning tomorrow at the earliest, but it got here yesterday). I installed it in my phone, and was immediately recognized and formatted accordingly without me doing anything. I connected the phone to the computer, and the music was transferred instantly. I played a few songs and videos to see if there was going to be a problem with the sound or lag time on the video. No problem whatsoever! This is a great product and cannot beat the price! Thanks!""

Since getting the card I have had no success getting it to register as fully operational. I have tried the card in new micro sd adapters (I have a few around), tried in a camera where it would format but would start failing in the other devices, even failed in the camera after a few pictures. This card also failed in 4 different notebooks bought within the last year and a cellphone. Some could say, perhaps my devices do not support sdhc; other cards have worked in these devices but this is the first brand and type not to. Following another review I found on the product website a software download for reformatting but this has not been successful either. My first clue this card was not working right was after plugging the card into my computer, it asked to be formatted, most cards don't ask to do this out of the box. As a product sold directly by amazon, perhaps I just got one of the 'very few' duds out there; doesn't appear to be fake but you can't always tell.""

Buy it from amazon, if it doesn't work you can return it, hassle free. Although, the description doesn't mention that this card is a class 4, it is a class 4 which is perfect for a mobile device like a phone. If you have a tablet device, I recommend you to get a class 6 since those devices demand faster speeds. This card comes in a retail package with only the card so you will need to have a adapter to use it with your computer. I have one from a previous purchase so that's not a problem for me. I bought this card to expand my file space for my android phone and it works fine. I've read other reviews where people experienced problems or defects but my experience is good so far. One note, is to make sure you format the card as FAT32 when you receive it because most mobile devices use fat32 file system or your device will not read it. Unless you have a windows device, then you need to format it as NTFS file system.""

The camera recorded the video, was able to transfer it from the camera to my computer and watch it on my computer, etc. Just wanted to mention it for anyone thinking of doing the same thing.

So if you want a class 4 memory card SanDisk is a good brand!

What a difference it makes.  Almost makes it seem like I have a new phone.  Now I can store all my music and new apps that I want.  Took it out of the package and plugged it in to the phone and oila, it worked - no problems whatsoever.  Just make sure to buy the 'retail packaging' version.""

"20120517","1.0","Didn't work.","So bought this item and when it got shipped to us immediately my husband had it in the computer to download songs on it and well it DIDN'T work. The mp3 player said that it only had 5 GB of memory. (we hadn't put anything on it yet) The computer said we needed to format it before we could put music onto it, so we tried to do that, didn't work. He then calls his techy brother to see if he is doing something wrong. Still didn't work. So we sent it back and got our refund.""
"20120517","5.0","Awesome for price","I purchased an Android that came with a 2gb micro SD card. But the phone itself had very little space. I needed more. Some of the SD cards out there are quite expensive. I found this one, and recognized SanDisk as a decent quality provider. I purchased it and cannot be happier. I now have the space I need on my phone, plus more. I can put books, pictures, and MP3s on my phone and use my phone as a Kindle, Ipod, etc. My phone is much quicker as well. I am very happy with this purchase.""
"20120516","5.0","Exactly what I needed!","This micro SD card was exactly what I was looking for.  My order arrived quickly and I am very satisfied with this seller.  I would absolutely do business with them again.  Thanks for the quick service.  Keep up the good work!""
"20120516","5.0","Exactly what they sale.","Not much to say in this case since it is just a memory card, I can say that it works and that is exactly what they offer, you can buy it with no problems,""

"20120516","1.0","NOT A 32Go, AND DOESN'T WORK","It's a fake 32Go card that does work for 1 month...I tried it on my phone, and it recognised it as a 32Go, but once arrived at 8Go, it said card is full.Then it erased data on the card, and finally it disconnect from the phone every now and then... and now I am gonna throw it as it is worse and worse.DON'T BUY IT !!!""
"20120515","1.0","Don't buy this","Regardless of what you order you will get a plastic Baggie with the card inside.  This is NOT a retail item....in fact it is questionable as to whether it is an authentic item.  Sandisk doesn't package in a Baggie.  The photos show the retail packaging,,,,you won't be getting that.Buy from a brick and mortar retail store where you can see and touch your purchase instead of being disappointed when you receive the item and realize that you aren't getting what you agreed to purchase.""
"20120515","5.0","Great Deal","This product was exactly as described and was a great deal.  Works great, from the research I did before purchasing this product SanDisk class 4 is the best value out there.  I have nothing to compare this SanDisk to, but I have been extremely happy with the performance so far.""
"20120514","1.0","DO NOT BUY","DO NOT BUY THIS! I transferred all of my pictures to this card when I got it.  Now NOTHING will recognize this. I have lost a lot of music(replaceable). but my pictures are not replaceable. I'm crushed by this. I will get my money back. Too bad I can't also get my memories.""

"20120513","5.0","SanDisk keeps supplying great products!","I have always found SanDisk Products to be of the highest quality and this item is no exception. The card was marked as a Class 4 and that is what was in the package. Some producers of the microSD Cards attempt to pass of the cards as a higher class than what the card is designed to be, not SanDisk. I had read that for most devices you should use a Class 10 Card, however, after researching the Classes I have found that in most cases a Class 4 Card will work just fine and be far more stable across multiple devices. I am using this card in an Android Tablet with no issues straight out of the box. Thank you SanDisk, again.""

"20120512","3.0","32GB Micro SD Card with onlt 29GB???","I ordered this SD card because I have had pretty good luck with these types of cards from Amazon...but in this case the advertised capacity is not even close to what is being portrayed, so it seems to be hit or miss.  The last one I got was 31.6GB, but this one is 29.01GB which is far shorter than what I had expected.  In every other way the card functions just like any other Class 4 Micro SD Card, but I'm really bummed about the capacity...I expected some decrease, but 3full Gigs is ALOT of space missing.The Packaging was great as usual, and was super easy to open, but i would have serious doubts about buying from this vender again.  Returning it is not an option for me, unfortunately, otherwise I'd return it in a heartbeat.I'd recommend you to steer clear of this vendor..so the moral is you do get what you pay for...lol""
"20120511","1.0","These aren't genuine SanDisk cards","I specifically ordered my 32GB card from Amazon as the seller because they said it would be in the retail packaging. Just got it today and it is not. It is in a little zip-loc bag with a computer printed label on the bag. This is not a genuine SanDisk product.This is what I wrote in a comment to another person's review: 'If your product doesn't come in the retail package, it's likely a knock-off from China. Sandisk does not sell in bulk packaging for wholesalers to turn around and sell in their own packaging. I no longer buy any Sandisk product unless it comes in the retail packaging so I know its bonafide. I went through this years ago when I got some suspicious cards and talked to Sandisk and found out they don't sell in bulk packaging.'My card is on its way back to Amazon.""

"20120509","5.0","On time, in great shape","I actually got this product a day earlier than Amazon said, which was great. I bought it for my new tablet, and it works great. It also is a lot cheaper than I found it at any of the stores near my home. I would say if you need a micro SD card, go with this one for sure.""
"20120509","5.0","Very very fast","Bought this to replace a Patriot 16GB Class 10 card. I was worried about the Class 4 rating, as I regularly back up my phone and need the backup to run quickly. This card completely blows my old card out of the water; the backup finishes about 5 times faster! I don't know if that means this card is fantastic, or the old card is terrible; I think probably a little of both. Best of all, this card is a little cheaper than what I paid for the old card (I'd had it for a while).As other people have noted, this card far outperforms its Class 4 rating in most operations. I am very pleased with this card and I recommend it to everyone I can. If you need a large card for a phone/tablet/camera, give this one a shot.""
