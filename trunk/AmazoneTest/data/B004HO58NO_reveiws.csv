"20120608","3.0","not the choice for low light photography","While this product definitely had some nice features - nice hand grip, good set up of buttons and menus, good macro for close shots......overall picture quality (especially for the file sizes created) was rather poor in indoor low light conditions.  Clarity was definitely lacking and color and shadowing was rather uneven.""
"20120605","5.0","Amazing","I really loved this camera. The 18x zoom worked great, although at first I wasn't fond of the quality, but once I messed with it for a while, I figured out how to make it better quality even after I had zoomed in all the way. It's light, but not so light that it feels cheap. I am not at all regretting my decision in purchasing this item. It uses 4 AA+ batteries, which is good, because if rechargeable batteries die quickly, and you can't go to the store and buy new ones in case it gets lost or you can't charge it at the time. It's very easy to use, and not very expensive at all. I saw a slightly better camera (the only difference was that it had 20x zoom and 16 MP) by Nikon for twice the price. Over all, it was pretty stinkin' amazing.""

"20120529","4.0","Not dissatisfied, but I'm selling it","I took this camera to Europe for six weeks and now I'm selling it. It's not that I'm dissatisfied, it's just that this camera taught me what I truly wanted in a super-zoom camera. I discovered that I use a camera like this as a video camera as much as a still camera -- maybe more. As a video camera it only shoots 720px HD, and the zoom (which loses focus while filming) isn't useful.As a still camera, it's hard to beat for the money. I especially like the viewfinder: viewfinders are a necessity in bright sunshine. I hardly used the LCD (for shooting) at all.Au revoir, Dear Fuji. You did a great job.""

"20120524","2.0","Video quality is poor.","We bought this camera because we wanted one to take higher quality photos and videos.  The pictures we've taken have been good.  But the video is REALLY BAD.We used this camera to film my granddaughters' dance recital.  The videos are worthless.  I thought that maybe we didn't have the settings right.  But my son, who is a professional photographer and videographer, saw nothing wrong with the settings.  I suppose we will use this camera for stills only.  Another thing (my fault) is the fact that the camera uses 4 AA batteries, which last about one day.  We have another Finepix camera which has a charging base, and I assumed this one would have one, too.  Again, this was my fault. We would never have purchased this camera had we known the video would be so poor.""

That was a great feature to have since I was going to travel down the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River.  Unfortunately I had not used the camera enough before the trip to realize on the Automatic settings it was not possible to reduce the ISO setting below 800.  On Manual settings either the shutter speed would not adjust reasonably thus getting blurred pics or the ISO would stay at 800 even though I tried to change it both on Auto and on regular setting. Therefore I have many picture of the Canyon that are washed out without the true color.  I am going to see if there is a way to return the camera for possible exchange or repair.""

The panorama capability is a nice little gadget, but i don't think i'll ever really use it. Also, the menus are very easy to navigate.

"20111027","5.0","Very nice for a pont and shoot","I purchased this camera on sale from a different vender, but was able to use my Amazon Prime account.  First I have to say, I ordered it on a Tuesday, and received it on Wednesday, not the next week, but the very next day.  I did not pay for overnight shipping, so I was all colors of impressed.  The first thing I noticed was the weight.  This camera is heavier than the average point and shoot camera, and larger too.  It won't fit in a pocket.  The packaging was nice, and well thought out. The initial setup was easy, and the camera took great pictures right out of the box.  I set it to the finest, and largest picture setting, to get the best quality possible.  The pictures blew me away.  The flash works very well, and the time from shutter press to acquisition is nice.  There is very little delay.  and when set on continuous photo, there is none what so ever.  The 18x optical zoom is nice.  Having a high optical, low digital zoom is the key to a good photo under zoom situations.  The hand feel of this camera is nice, very much like a 35mm, and the view finder works nicely.  If you wanted to save the batteries, turn off the LCD screen and use the view finder.  Although this is NOT a SLR camera, and the lens is not changeable, this camera is very good for the price.  I am not a professional photographer.  I find  that I have great confidence when shooting photos.  If you are in the market for a camera that can do more than the basic point and shoot, this is a great choice.""
"20111023","3.0","Good Photos - Sometimes - If You Work Hard","I bought an earlier version of this Fujifilm camera because of my wonderful experience with the Fujifilm S5700.  I wanted the wider 28mm zoom on this model, and so I thought I was 'upgrading'.The S2950 uses AA batteries, which are easy to find.  Someone who takes only 300 or 400 photos each year could put in a set of AA lithium batteries, and only change batteries once a year.With 'pre-charged' AA rechargeable batteries, you can get more than 600 photos per charge without flash, or about 200 photos per charge if you use the flash for every photo. Because the batteries can be recharged several hundred times, you can get several years of use from a set of batteries.In fact, I have found that getting good photos from this camera requires some thought, and some work.  My best results have come from using the 'Aperture Mode' and locking the ISO at ISO 64 and the Aperture at f/4.  In good sunlight, most photos are reasonably good, although the camera tends to shift blues toward purple, and reds toward orange.Most of my family and friends have dark brown skin tones, which the S2950 shifts toward greenish-brown or orange-brown, especially with flash photos.  The results with paler 'anglo' skin tones are better, with the camera adding a bit of ruddiness to pale skin that looks attractive.In various auto modes, the results are often poor, as the camera selects ISO 400 even in good light, resulting in photos that are grainy and lack fine detail, contrast, and color saturation.  The solution is to use manual modes, lock the ISO at ISO 64 and f/4.The BIGGEST problem is that my camera has focus problems in temperatures above about 90 degrees.  In Texas, afternoon temperatures stay above 90 degrees from the end of April to the beginning of October.  Shooting outdoors in the summer requires taking each photo two or three times, in hopes that one photo will be sharply focused.The strong point of this camera is that it sells for half the price of comparable Panasonic and Canon cameras.  Among 'Super Zooms', the S2950 is a real bargain...worth the extra work it takes to get good photos if you want a 'Super Zoom' and are on a tight budget.Buy it if you are willing to WORK at getting good photos, and you are willing to take a photo two or three times to get one good picture.  However, if you want a camera that you can just turn on, snap away on automatic, and get great results, this is NOT the camera for you.""
"20111011","1.0","Inferior to my older FinePix camera","As soon as I held this camera, I knew something was wrong. I was pleased to find it a bit smaller than the FinePix S5200 I had owned since 2005. But it was lightweight and flimsy: the plastic housing actually seemed to warp slightly under a gentle grip. It felt and looked cheap, right down to the lens cap that didn't lock in place.This camera should certainly be an improvement over my older model. It has image stabilization, more megapixels, greater optical zoom, etc. Cameras have come a long way in six years.But it's just inferior. I took several pictures with both, side-by-side, trying both automatic and semi-manual modes. (The S2950 doesn't offer the manual focus option that the old S5200 offered, so I couldn't compare that.) In every case, the S2950 took a blurrier, grainier picture.I can't account for its lousiness, but I could return the camera, and I did.""

"20111002","5.0","Great camera, very happy I purchased it.","I am a complete newbie to digital cameras other than BASIC point and shoot Kodak Easy Share I had about 6 years ago.  This camera is great for a beginner like me.  I shot some nice close ups of flowers outdoors in the macro setting and in auto setting just using the zoom feature, and am happy with both ways.  I did take multiple shots to get great ones, but that is probably typical. So far I have only used the auto setting, and the Scene recognition setting and am happy so far, looking forward to playing with manual settings soon.The camera is comfortable to hold and shoot both one and two handed.  Feels like a good solid camera.  The lens cap is basically useless and falls off if you look at it wrong, but no biggie.  I would recommend this to someone looking to get into photography and also for the weekend shot taker.Not sure about battery life as I have only had it for 3 days, but I have taken a few hundred shots so far and still going strong.  The Viewfinder is also great in the bright sunlight when the LCD doesn't show up as well, and all the info displayed on the LCD is also displayed in the viewfinder.If you are considering this camera, just go for it, you will like it.  I wavered for almost a month and wish I had just ordered it back then.  The price on Amazon is at least $20 cheaper than anywhere I have seen it in stores here in Michigan.""

I do not like the fact that so many of the newer generation digital cameras only have an LCD screen. I am from the old school 35mm photography and I insist on a viewfinder. I have been using 35mm film cameras for over forty years. The 3in LCD screen is quite nice to view your shots. The wide variety of exposure settings is impressive and suits any condition that I encountered thus far. I have had not had the S2950 long enough to express any cons just yet.

I am going on a trip to China and was thinking that I would kick myself if I didn't invest in a new Camera.  The s2950 seemed like the most bang for your buck.  It is.  I have always been a fan of Fuji after previously owning there Finepix F20.  I did a side by side comparison of the photos took by each and there is hands-down no question proof that the S2950 takes much much better shots and is a vast improvement over my antiquated F20. I mean I could visually see how awesome the S2950 is.  Lots of features, half of which I won't use.  The 18x zoom is incredible.  The panorama as others have said is very awesome and very easy to use.  The pictures themselves are very crisp and clear.  The people saying it only takes ok pictures obviously aren't using the correct settings for their situation.  I also like the shutter select option as I plan on taking some artsy waterfall pictures while I'm there.  The pop-up flash is powerful.  This is the first camera I've owned with a pop-up so I've caught myself acouple times forgetting to pop it up. The lens cap as others have said is flimsy. It has yet to fall off but once I put it in a bag I imagine it will.  The battery and SDHC compartment door also seems flimsy, going to have to be careful as you should be any way. All in all I'm extremely happy with my investment and haven't second guessed it since I took the first picture. 5/5.""

"20110902","5.0","Excellent Value","This is an SLR Style digital camera meaning that while offering a lot of the same features as an Digital SLR it does not offer the ability to switch lenses and certain other higher end features.

It is also light enough to handle with one hand.The box comes with batteries, a nice strap, a lens cover, a quick start paper manual, a splitter cable that will allow the camera to communicate directly with your tv video/audio in ports or via usb to your Win 7 PC, and a cd with a full owner's manual and a crapy photo software I don't recomend installing. The box does not come with storage card and the camera does not have internal memory, which for me was no draw back since as a computer geek I had a handful of sd cards and adapter for micro and mini sd memory cards laying around the desktop and just dropped in a 16 gb card and it was recognized and I was able to start shooting right away.  I think the sd mem card was a kingston brand micro card in an sd adapter.

"20110810","5.0","Great Price Brings Upgraded Features","I purchased this camera from QVC (it was their special value for that day) on their easy pay plan.I began using this camera out of the box, on its auto settings indoors; it takes some very impressive photos. I was happy to see that my min pin didnt suffer the usual 'I am a vicious red eyed dog' look. To compare the usefulness of the flash, I took photos in absolute darkness and then used the flash. It was great to see that the flash really did its thing without the great wash out effect. The flash worked just as well in regular settings that required it.I used the other features for the photos I am going to describe in this paragraph. I work in the buildings behind the World Trade Center so taking pictures of the progress from our office is priceless. On this camera, the pictures are the kind that everyone who visits wishes they could take from this view. I had no light 'bounce back' from the several floors of newly installed windows on the Freedom Tower (still under construction). The zoom feature is so amazing that I was able to zoom in on a worker cleaning out one of the reflecting pools. It was not a blurry 'it could be anything' picture, you can clearly see him, the color of his skin, shirt, jeans and the hose he was using. I also have views of the Statue of Liberty, the surrounding islands and New Jersey. I used the zoom on these photos, again, amazing clear detailed photographs.I'm still an amateur when it comes to using this camera but honestly you don't need major brains to figure this guy out. There are several settings for babies, snow, beach, flowers, night etc. Every one of the pictures I took with each of these settings came out VERY nice and clear with no doubt of what you just photo'd. You can take videos and also use the view finder. The camera is able to use any size SD card (I have 16Gs in mine) and standard AA batteries (this one needs four). My advice is get two sets of good rechargeable batteries. It is less expensive in the long run and you will always be ready to capture anything you find interesting.An instruction manual is included for those who may have trouble figuring out certain settings or icons. There are manual settings which are good for those 'professionals' who are tired of dragging around their heavy telescopes (I see your types when you come to visit us in NYC) around their necks but still want to get that quality shot.In my opinion, this is a serious step up for anyone who still owns a pocket camera because of the quality of the zoom, panorama, pixels and other features that pocket cameras lack.""

"20110802","3.0","I wish I'd known, so I'll tell you.....","I have yet to put my new S2950 to the test by actually using it in real field conditions, so perhaps I'm way premature in commenting; however, there are a couple of things that, had I been aware of them before the purchase, would have been deal breakers for me.The aperature ranges that I've seen published for the S2950 are F3.1-F6.4 (wide) and F5.6-F11 (tele).  What I haven't seen mentioned is that the extremes are the only settings one can choose on both Aperature Priority or Full Manual.  In other words, at any focal length, there are only two aperature settings that can be chosen--in the case of the shortest focal length, one is able to choose only F3.1 or F6.4, nothing between.  The other thing of which I was unaware is that, while a specific ISO can be set on Aperature and Full Manual, on Shutter Priority, ISO can be set only on Auto, with a ceiling of either ISO 400 or ISO 800.  I guess this makes sense; since the lens has only two aperature settings, the ISO has to slide to accomodate the partial stop differentials at which the shutter can be set, but that doesn't mean I have to like it.Before I close, I probably should mention that I'm a D-SLR user, used to complete control, who purchased this camera as a convenient option to allow me to take photos without five pounds of camera hanging from my neck.  As such, I might be looking for more than would the average bridge camera purchaser.  On the other hand, my old Kodak 610, which I foolishly gave away, allowed me the ability to set the aperature to any opening across its entire (wider)range, and to set a specific ISO in any photo mode.""

I was surprised at the zoom - 18x, but I guess I didn't realize the power of 18! I'd use the word 'awesome', but... One of my must-have features was a viewfinder, which is hard to find on point-and-shoot cameras. I find it easier to use, bracing it against your face gives you a steadier hand, and it gives you a more precise view than the screen. The size is perfect - lightweight and easy to carry around. Feels good in hands. Grip allows one-handed shooting if necessary. Videos are clear. Sound could be better, but, hey, the camera is less than $200! A snap to transfer photos/videos to your pc, Facebook, etc. All-in-all, an excellent value. Took this thing to Yosemite twice and got some brilliant photos and videos.  Pleased as puch, I am.""

Wish I could rate it NO stars.I wanted a camera that runs on AA batteries and has an optical (or electronic) viewfinder. So when on vacation in bright sunny places and my batteries die, I can run into any store, buy standard AA's, pop them in, and use the viewfinder to take priceless memories of loved ones I can't see in the glare of the ubiquitous LCD displays.There only seem to be 5 cameras left in the entire point-and-shoot marketplace that have both features. And only 2 of them under $200.The Fuji FinePix S2940 had a lot of promise. But for three little things.1) Picture quality is POOR. My old 2megapixel Fuji takes better looking pictures.2) Video Quality is worse. It may be full 1280 HD. But the quality is horrible. Gritty and grainy. With no image options available at all. My Canon PowerShot takes great videos with numerous options, including macro. And this Fuji sound quality is far worse than the image quality. It too is gritty. There is a constant white noise present which drowns out any dialog unless the subject is shouting. And it frequently crackles like high-pitched thunderstorm.3) The Battery Door is prone to breakage. It is the same lousy design as my 8-year old 2mp Fuji Finepix. And that one broke after only a few months' use. The worse part is, it's not actually the door that will break. It's the flimsy little retention tabs on the camera body itself that break. The door could be replaced (according to Fuji customer service). But when this bugger breaks, you'd have to replace the camera body. Terrible design. I guess they feel built-in obsolescence is a good thing. Makes you buy more frequent replacements.Well, this POS is going back to the store tomorrow. And I'll buy a Canon or Nikon instead. Even if I can't see what I'm doing on bright sunny vacation days.Hopefully camera manufacturers will wake up and start offering more cameras with back-up viewfinders for when you're not vacationing in a dark cave or rainforest.""

"20110715","3.0","Not too Impressed","I got this camera as a birthday gift from my sister.  I was very excited at first because it has similar features as my Panasonic which I like it very much, and this one even includes a PANORAMA function that I thought was awesome.  However, after I tried it out I found out why it is selling with a much lower price than the other similar models: The indoor shots are of very poor quality (as the other reviewer has mentioned, including the consentaneous comment attached to that review).  The outdoor shots are much better but no way great.I give it a three star for the affordable price, and the very easy-to use panorama function (although it does not always result in a smooth wide-angle looking picture, many times the pictures are connected with obvious kinks).""

"20110623","4.0","Great Camera for the Price","I have to say I am a fan of Fuji, and this camera is no exception. I wanted to upgrade to a higher megapixel camera and this seemed the right fit for me. The cosmetic changes Fuji made compared to my old camera are minor.(I'm glad they didn't change the body style)It's still light enough so that it doesn't feel bulky but sturdy enough that it 'feels' like a camera. They moved the media card slot inside with the batteries (I prefer them separate) but it is better than the media card slot on the older version of this camera which tended to pop open unknowingly. You do have to be aware of how you're holding the camera so you don't lose the batteries. I also liked the versatility of being able to use more than one type of media card (they removed that feature on this camera). They added the panoramic feature which is cool and the shutter speed is faster so that makes the continuous mode a lot more fun to use! The auto flash feature you have to engage ( it was automatic on the older version) Overall, still a great buy.""

"20110612","5.0","Watch your shutter speed!","With careful use this camera can give very sharp photographs, but only if you watch what you are doing. This is especially true at the extremes of camera's operating range.Telephoto photography requires either a tripod or very short exposures. For example without a tripod a shutter speed of 1/250th is required at 9X, and 1/500th at 18X.Macro photography results in a very limited depth of field (i.e. the distance that a 3D object remainds in focus). Another pitfall of macro photography is the motion of either the object or the camera. A tripod or a very steady hand is required. Using the electronic viewfinder and balance your elbows against your torso will help steady the camera. Pray that there is no wind to move the object.In summary this excellent camera will take excellent photos if used carefully.""
"20110611","5.0","Great point and shoot to use in place of a DSLR","I got this camera after my Sony Alpha a290 was stolen to not necessarily replace it, but to have until I can afford a new one. The camera is a bit bulky, but that is the only con I have. It is great for being on the go because it is still much smaller than a DSLR, and can take beautiful pictures. I mostly use the Macro setting for nature photography, so that was a main reason I chose this camera, and it does not disappoint. It is also great in low-light at night. GREAT BUY!

It is very easy to switch between the view finder and the display.It takes fantastic pictures and you can use rechargeable batteries if you want.

I know cameras and believe me this thing is garbage. I will be getting rid of ours ASAP!  low light? Forget it. This camera is not for anyone who is serious about qaulity video or stills. And quite frankly I think its closer to a 'toy aisle ' camera than the real thing. This camera is a 'sunny day -good exposure' kind of camera and is worthless for documenting experiences where low light conditions are prevalent.  I suppose this camera would be good for people who want to take an hour to set up the shot.

Only down side is that the auto focus illuminator (used in low light settings) is very bright, almost laser like and can be distracting to the subject.

"20120308","4.0","Target audience apparently not that smart.","I have to say this. Too many people turn this camera down because it doesn't do well in the auto shooting format. Well I am here to say something. I didn't purchase this to shoot genetic automatic Shots. I bought it for the powerful lens, but mostly the fact it has nearly full manual controls. If you want a standard point and shoot, look elsewhere. to sell this at this price point and afford to put these manual controls, they had to sacrifice somewhere. Buy a point and shoot at this price point with no manual controls you'll be happier if you don't want manual control.Now that that is over with, I'll tell you what's great. Zoom is great especially macro. Having the evf is great for stable shots. photos are crisp, well colored and very detailed. ISO200/400 is great for everyday use. All of this paragraph is referring to full manual mode shooting. Aperture and shutter priority is great as well.Only flaws? Video optical zoom is noisy, and photo ISO noise is rough advice 800.This camera it's not a point and shoot. For the price the manual controls are amazing. Panoramic shots are awesome with the right scene. If you want more power than just a point and shoot, get this camera.This camera deserves more respect, don't knock it for something it want intended for.""
"20120302","4.0","Best budget camera I have ever bought","I bought this camera in an 'emergency' in Kathmandu when my other camera failed the day before I was due to leave on a one month trek in the mountains. I didn't have a lot of time to compare cameras or read any reviews. The reason I wanted this one specifically is because it has a manual viewfinder (not just an LCD screen) which is hard to find in budget cameras these days! I hate the cameras that only have the LCD screen, because it is so hard to see what you are shooting in bright sunlight. I also wanted a camera that took normal batteries, rather than a special battery that had to be recharged. In the mountains there wasn't always electricity, so I would not be able to rely on being able to recharge my battery. I am so impressed with this camera, for the price I paid (which was more than what it is listed here!). I ended up taking some really amazing shots. It is funny too, because many people who don't know a lot about cameras see me with this one and think that it is a fancy, professional camera, haha, I guess because it is chunkier than the average budget point and shoot. Unlike most of the other little point and shoots these days that may only have 5x zoom, it has 18x optical zoom. You can't go wrong with the camera for the price you are paying, just buy it""
"20120228","4.0","Great Camera for the price!","About two years ago I purchased the fujifilm finepix s1500 with 10 mega pixel and 12x zoom. The camera was great and never had any issues , this year me and my wife took a cruise to Cozumel and Belize. We purchased the fuji s2950 as an upgrade. Most of all the features were the same the difference was the color, everything looked great. I cant really see the difference in the megapixel but the zoom was also a good upgrade. Overall the camera is good, takes good pictures has all the great features needed when taking pictures in nature and out at sea. I gave the rating a 4 because although it takes better pictures not much changed from the models.""
"20120228","5.0","Awesome camera-- everything I wanted","I am a total amateur when it comes to photography, but I wanted something that was a step up from my regular point and shoot digital camera. A lot of my friends are photographers and I would always be jealous of their amazing pictures. I was reluctant to purchase this based on the bad reviews, but I have had great luck with this camera. The pictures look professional, and the flash is incredible. I took some pictures of my friends out at a party last week and the flash lit up the entire room. Everyone wanted their picture taken with my camera. A girl even looked at a picture on my camera's screen and goes 'Are you a professional photographer?' I'm so pleased with this camera. Pictures are better when the flash it used-- it's easily the camera's best feature. The zoom is also impressive. The lens cap does fall off too easily sometimes-- be sure to buy a bag for this camera. I'd definitely recommend this camera if you're looking for a step up from your regular digital camera.""
"20120228","1.0","This camera SUCKS","I specifically bought this camera because it was big and had the view finder. When I bought it from best buy the pics i took were ok.

They came back saying we tested are cameras too and the white noise sound you hear on video mode seems to be a characteristic of the camera. I thought fujifilm was the top of the line but if they're putting out crap like this it a  no brainer why it was on sale.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!Severely disappointed!!!""
"20120226","3.0","good point and shoot","I have used film camera since I was 14 and had recently been using digital.  Love the new features.  I have 2 Cannons now.  My wife wanted a simple point and shoot and that is exactly what you get.  I have had this camera 1 month and this is what I found out.  when using the zoom, do not expect the  a crisp shot.  You are going to need a tripod.  When inside using a flash, get within 3 feet and be sure every one or everything is on the same level distance.  Otherwise the person or object in front will be well exposed and everything else will be dark.Outside or in natural lights look great.  Crisp and clean and the sensors do it right.  But again, if you use the zoom lens too far out such as 18X you really need a tripod.In any setting the shutter release has a slight delay so you need to be ready to plan ahead sometimes.It is difficult to use the manual settings.  It takes some time to figure it out such as changing the ISO or shutter speed.Overall it's a good point and shoot but inside flash is weak.""
"20120225","2.0","Not an ideal replacement camera","I purchased the Fuji S2950 digital camera in the fall of 2011 and as I have had other Fuji digital cameras with fairly long zooms on their point & shoot cameras, I was disapointed with this camera. My intent was to replace my old Fuji S1000 12X optical zoom digital camera with this one, but I cannot as the older S1000 Fuji camera took clearly superiour pictures in all situations....day or in low light situations. I took this new Fuji S2950 camera to several outdoor events and used the 'automatic' mode with no flash as it was broad daylight and the pictures mostly were blurred or 'washed out'....a huge disapointment for me. I had to end up using a much smaller compact Fuji AX300 for my photos for both of those events, even tho the optical zoom on that compact camera was only 5X, their photos turned out much better.If I had to list the pros on this camera, I guess it would be that it's fairly easy to use, has an optical viewfinder, good flash and fairly long zoom. You also get a decent video with this camera in the video mode.Battery life is decent with this camera as it uses 4 'AA' batteries.The only con that I have had with this camera is the poor picture quality in any situation.It's a nice-looking digital camera with a decent zoom and plenty of features on it, but it simply did not live up to my expectations as an ideal replacement for my much older and now gone Fuji S1000 digital camera.If Fuji would have spent a bit more time with getting the camera to take a better picture in the Auto mode, then I would have given this camera a better review.""
"20120224","4.0","Definitely a great deal for the price","I don't write reviews often on Amazon, but I felt compelled to write one for this camera. In my opinion there are many misleading reviews for this product. I've been using the camera for a few days without any issues. I actually found the quality of the picture to be quite good, and the shutter time is pretty quick. Sometimes the HD movies have trouble focusing but it didn't seem to be a big disruption.Everyone saying that the camera has lousy shutter times in between pictures, probably has a crappy SD card in it. I went from a microSD card in an adapter (class 2 maybe?) to a class 10 SDHC card. BIG difference in shutter time. It would take about a second in between pictures, now its no more than 1/2 second in between. So if your shutter takes a while in between pictures, get a better SD card. Make sure it has a fast write speed (class 6 or above is best). Fujifilm's site recommends class 4 or higher.As for the picture quality being poor, I've tried my camera in all different lighting conditions. In doors during the day with and w/o flash. Outside during the day, and night with flash. Zoomed in and out. Picture quality isn't GREAT but its very good. I read the manual and tweaked the settings for the picture quality on the camera which seemed to help. Make sure its set to Image size = L(16:9), and Image quality = F (fine). This should give you the best quality pictures with the camera.Bottom line, no this isn't going to be a great camera, but its a very good one for the price range its in. Your average person would like this camera but its not for people big into photography.""

Unfortunately, the quality of the pictures I took were awful - most still shots were blurry/unclear with 'auto' mode. Also, it was so slow capturing the shots, I couldn't take a picture of my pet because she would move before the shot was captured.

THE CAMERA IS LIGHT, you need just the right light settings for your picture to turn out correct. most of the pictures i have taken are a little fuzzy as well.  good luck""
"20120206","2.0","not impressed","I used this camera both indoors and outdoors, and I thought the image processing was slow, and the amount of light captured by the camera in low light conditions was surprisingly low for a camera this size. In fax, my little Optio performed better in low light with no flash. I also found it had to get the camera to focus on foreground in macro. I ended up selling it back to one of my guys for fifty bucks, because I am on a military installation where I can't mail things back over thirteen ounces. I'll just be spending 400 dollars on a decent camera, like the nice Canon I used to own.""

"20120125","2.0","Nothing Impressive","I purchased this camera from Fuji and was initially excited about it, but that excitement turned to disappoint after about 15 days when I sent it back to Fuji for a refund.While they market as a DSLR to be truthful my Canon power-shot point and shoot can walk circles around this camera.My biggest problems with this camera are:Picture Quality:While it shoots at 14MP the quality of the picture even on its highest settings is poor at best. The continuous shot mode on 20 shots shoots at only 3MP (My cell phone would shoot better pictures). The pictures are often grainy and the cameras proformance is slow with lag in storing pictures (even with a fast SD card) and there is a lot of delay on the settings buttons. I would push the preview button and it could take several seconds for the menu to come up.Lack of custom settings:The shutter speed only goes as slow as 8', the apature only has 2 adjustment settings, there is no adjustment for ISO, and while it does have a lot of nice features they are often hard to access through various poorly designed menus or complicated button sequences.Battery LifeThe camera used 4 AA batteries and if you are considering purchasing this camera you should definitely buy rechargeable batteries at the same time. This camera will burn through batteries faster than a can of mace at an Occupy Wall Street protest.Cheap feelThe camera has a cheap feel to it, especially so with the battery compartment located on the bottom of the camera that has a tendency to suddenly open or not close all the way.This camera is a good value for someone wanting to take good family pictures but if you know anything about photography this camera will only irritate you beyond belief.""

I WAS VERY WRONG. I did read the reviews before purchasing this, and I almost didn't buy it because of the bad reviews, but there were so many good ones I decided to buy it anyway.  I should have listened to the bad reviews. The image quality is HORRIBLE, it is extremely grainy and the colors are extremely off.  The settings are hard to navigate and the camera is not very user friendly. I can not figure out how to change any of my manual settings.  I do NOT reccomend anyone buy this camera unless you want to waste your money.  For those of you who think this camera is great you are clearly very BLIND.

I've taken pictures as soon as the camera arrived and it works great.  Thanks to everyone who reviewed the camera as the majority were quite accurate.  The camera is easy to handle and comes with four AA batteries.  I bought a 32GB memory card the same time I bought the camera so that both arrived together.  Everything came together within a couple of days (memory card, camera case, and camera).  The pictures I've taken looks great, and I especially like the panorama feature.  If you want to record a video, a 32GB memory card will only record for 10 minutes before you run out of memory.  As to the durability and life of the camera, obviously I don't know since I only received the camera today.  But I must say, I recommend this camera as I am confident it will last a long time.""
"20120110","5.0","Great Camera!!!!","Camera came on time in perfect condition. It was a Christmas gift for my wife but I gave it to her early so she could use it during the holidays. She went crazy with it! We live on a tropical island so she was always going to the beach and the rain forest to take photos. The quality of the photos and the zoom were amazing. Great features especially for the price. Would think cause it uses 4 batteries it would wste alot of power but it doesn't! I bought some Walgreens Alkaline Batteries that were on sale and I used those babies for almost a week of non-stop photo sessions. No cons yet. It's a great buy.""
"20120110","5.0","Excellent Cameras","Excellent camera, my second Fujifilm camera, the first being the S6000. Trouble with the S2950 is that it's probably just a matter of time before the battery door breaks off (very cheaply made). The lens cap falls off easily (not a big deal), but  the worst thing is that the owner's manual is a pdf file. I always like having a manual in my camera bag in case I need to find something quick while away from the computer. The pdf file is 141 pages, too large to print and keep in the bag. Fujifilm could have spent a couple of dollars more on the battery door, the lens cap, and a usable manual and they could raise the price of the camera a couple of dollars to cover it all and then it would be a perfect package.""
"20120109","5.0","Good Product at Good Price","Got it for my wife who knows nothing about digital cameras. In no time at all she was taking beautiful pictures. Good combination of auto point-and-click features and manual over-rides for artistic work. Old-fashioned view-finder as well as screen is a really aid when shooting outdoors in bright light that can may screen viewing difficult. Nice that it runs on common AA batteries available everywhere.As some other reviewers have noted, the lens cap pops off too easily and the door for the batteries is flimsy, so I recommend that anyone who buys this camera buy a cheap case for it so you don't risk losing those important covers.Also, note, this camera does not come with a memory card. So if you plan to surprise someone with a gift, as I did, you better take the camera out of the box, go spend a few bucks on a memory card, and put it in. Fortunately, I had done exactly that, so my wife was able to open it on Christmas Day and start using it immediately.It's not professional quality DSLR, but it is also no where near the cost of a DSLR. For 'bridge camera' between the point-and-click and the DSLR it is very good and I highly recommend it.""
"20120107","5.0","This is a sweet bang for the buck!","I recently upgraded to the S2940 (Walmart sells the S2950 in their stores as the S2940), after using a Nikon Coolpix S570 for about a year. At this time, the price difference between my old Nikon and the new Fuji is around $30, and let me say that it is worth every penny and then some. The Fuji takes such better quality pictures, from low light to bright sunny light, and the video is drastically better because it's 720 high definition. All the features that you get are so much more useful and you actually will use them. At least I seem to. :O) The reason why I am comparing my old and new camera, is so when you read this little blurb, it will make you think twice about not investing a little more money into the camera. You'll get a noticable jump up in picture and video quality, plus getting some nice usable features that work well. Normal 'point and shoot' cameras are decent and simple to use if you are a teenager or a great-grandparent, but point and shoot is just....point and shoot. Thanks for reading!""

The photos came out very clear even on the 18x zoom setting. Very easy to operate and fairly light weight. Though it takes four batteries it lasts quite a long time.The cons are the size, studio USB cord. As far as the size, it's rather large so I have a hard time carrying it around in my handbag without leaving removing some items.Where the studio it came is good, I had troubles installing it at first. I ended up having to re-install it due to issues with opening the studio.The USB cord is pretty short as well. It's the right length but just barely reaches out beyond my hard drive. I have to set the camera on my hard drive or floor rather than on my desk.But overall it's handy camera and very easy to use. Great for amateurs/beginners or hobby-photographers.""

"20111227","4.0","A very good camera, but not perfect","In the few months that I have owned the Fuji Finepix, I have taken well over 1,000 shots. So far, it's done a decent job. In my personal experience, I have been impressed with its performance outdoors and indoors with flash or in well-lit areas. It has not performed particularly well indoors without a flash when the lighting is low.Pros:-Excellent 18x zoom with wide angle lens.-Stunning outdoor photography in daylight.-Solid indoor photography with flash, or in well-lit rooms.-A strong flash. Can light up a large, pitch black Cathedral-style church.-Very good picture quality in video mode; 720p.-Panorama mode.-Optional pop-up flash. Not having to go through the menu every time to turn off the flash like I'm forced to do with my Canon is a plus.-Good grip to the camera. It feels comfortable in your hands.-Uses 4 AA batteries (highly recommend rechargeable).-Nice battery discharge feature.-Viewfinder.-Large LCD screen.-Quick start up time. Fairly quick shot to shot time, save when using flash.-High ISO available.-Continuous shooting available.Cons:-Poor indoor low-light photographs.-Camera zooming and autofocusing are LOUD in video mode.-Panoramic shots often do not stitch well.-No manual focus.-The auto white balancing leaves a lot to be desired.It's certainly not a professional camera or a perfect one, but it's a very good camera that most would find appealing. Very easy to use, and takes solid pictures except in low light. Looks spiffy too!""

"20111223","4.0","A wonderful Camera!","I bought this camera (Fujifilm Finepix S2950) because I had a daughter - and I have always loved photography but couldn't afford a $600-$1200 camera. I thought 14 megapixel and 18x wide angle lens, I should be pretty happy with it.I couldn't be happier - except now the camera is a little older - and the pictures are blurry/fuzzy more often then not. I bought the extended warranty - and I am going to send it back, to get a replacement. I Love this camera - it takes AMAZING outdoor shots. Better then anything a regular little handheld digital camera or cell phone could take! I would be cautious when using the flash. It worked GREAT when I first bought the camera - and then it kinda just started going downhill. As for the picture resolution and how the pictures turn out - I love it when its working correctly. Another downfall, is it takes 4 batteries (AA) instead of 2 - so, rechargeable batteries are a must. I have 8, I use 4 and I charge 4 at all times. If you use your camera more then casually, I would suggest maybe an extra (3rd) set (one for charge, one for use, and one for backup). Other then the batteries, and the downhill flash, I would still recommend this camera to family/friends, because it does take WONDERFUL outdoor shots!If buying this camera, which in my opinion would be good for starting out photographers, or people who want that professional looking shot without the professional price! I would suggest getting an extended warranty, maybe 3 or 5 years. It's a little pricey - but worth it!""

"20111117","4.0","After several months of usage;","I read all of the reviews for this camera on Amazon and other sites prior to purchasing.  I'm not a professional photography, but I am a journalist, I need good quality photos from anywhere, anytime.  As far as my photos go?  They're excellent, I mean, you're not going to get magazine ready photos unless you know what you're doing, but there's two automatic settings for amateurs, which is what I use the most because when I'm taking candid photos, I don't really have time to sit there and fiddle with the exposure or anything else.The zoom is for days!  I love it.  They're great for taking photos at a football game, or anywhere you can't be up close and personal.The only bad thing I have to say about the camera is that the battery door IS flimsy.  I saw the comments on it so I was cautious with my camera when I first got it.  Since the memory card is in the same spot at the batteries, you have to open the door to get your photos, but, the camera comes with its cords.  So I make sure I always have my cord with me everywhere and I always use it to take pictures off of my camera.The lens cap is pretty 'flimsy' too.  The cap itself is fine, but it isn't a cap that you squeeze on the sides so it unlatches and latches to your camera, it just slides on.  Which means it comes off pretty easy.  But, when I'm holding my camera bag in one hand and pulling my camera out with the other.  I don't really have any hand to take the cap off with, so it's nice sometimes to be able to just scoot it off by dragging the lens against the inside of my camera bag.I don't think the camera is very fragile.  I've dropped my camera once because the strap got caught on the corner of a corner when I went to pick my camera up.  It didn't land on the lens though, the bottom of my camera where the batteries are hit the floor, and my door burst open and my batteries rolled everywhere, but everything still works perfectly fine.In all honestly, you could a small, compact digital camera from Sony or even Fuji as well for the same price, and the same quality camera.  But I choose to buy the FinePixS2950 because I like have something sturdy to hold in my hands, and I LOVE the viewfinder.  It's a legit viewfinder, what you see, is what you get.  I had a Sony CyberShot that I loved, but when the screen cracked and I was resorted to using the viewfinder, I noticed if I zoomed in all the way.. my picture was completely off of what I wanted to take a photo of.  This Fuji has an electronic view finder though, which also means I can switch from the LCD screen when it's sunny outside and see what I'm doing.I LOVE my camera, and it's worth the money.""

I am going to tell you the truth.Some of the reviewers are exaggerating, its not so simple to use. I just got it out the box, I automatically knew how to pop open the flash, and how to use auto mode. Everything else you need to read in the manual which is a 'BASIC manual' the fuller more developed manual you will have to download off their website or buy!! I was reading the manual it tells me to go to page 98 and 101 for extended explanation on features, but this manual only consists of around 25 pages!! In 3 languages!There are TONS of features. I turned the light off in my living room, It was pitch dark, I took a pic with the flash, it came out crisp , clear, and bright!! I tested the zoom for blur, it was not blurry at all, still crisp!Love this camera very happy I purchased it and not the NIKKON L120 for that high price.
