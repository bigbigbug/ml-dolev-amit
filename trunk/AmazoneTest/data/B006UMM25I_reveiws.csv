I have a slight addiction to cameras and own about 15 now. This is by far my favorite right now. From the color of it, the ease of carrying it in a small handbag or my pocket to all the features it has. The photos come our beautifully. Definitely worth the money. I am not a photographer but feel like one when I use this. Enjoy it!""

"20120609","4.0","Not bad","Upon arriving in beautiful California for a long vacation, I dropped my Canon S90 -- a miraculous point & shoot, legendary for its picture quality.  Stunned, I dropped into the nearest retail store & bought a quick make-do replacement. I chose the Elph 110 HS because it had the widest aperture of all the offerings (f2.7) & was the most pocketable. I prayed that our vacation pictures would be decent.After 10 days of putting the Elph 110 HS through its paces, I think I'll keep it.  The color quality is wonderful. The camera meters well. The image sharpness varies: soft in the corners, and not as sharp at wide angle or tele. The best images are mid range; at 2 feet to 25 feet, the Elph 110 is as sharp as anything from the S90. You need to pay strict attention to where the camera is focusing as the auto settings latch on to strange things. Make sure to switch between macro, mid & distant focusing. I was happier using SuperFine compression & custom color settings, bumping up the sharpness, contrast & saturation a bit, and shooting in P (Program) mode where I could control the focus.  Auto has its uses, and for quick snaps, it does a good job.  The flash set just the right amount of fill flash. I was especially pleased with my flash shots. My low light pictures turned out fine with additional flash or slower shutter speed or a white balance adjustment or a little exposure compensation, and I didn't have to bother using higher ISO settings. It is marvelously portable, slipping into pockets, purses, small fanny packs & eyeglass cases with ease. Battery goes from empty to fully charged in two hours.The camera has good capabilities: exposure lock, focus lock, flash exposure lock, exposure compensation, Canon's ample array of color effects, good white balance settings (including custom white balance), a good drive mode, and can even take photos in square format (I like!). It has Stitch Assist for panoramic shots.  Long Shutter mode allows for shutter times up to 15 seconds & is easy to use. There is a grid display option.Settings: Less useful ones are toy camera, fish eye (wish it were a true fish eye), posterizer, soft focus, miniaturizer.  There is a snow setting, but no sunset setting.  There is no sports/kids/pets or otherwise high shutter speed setting. Supposedly in auto the camera can detect children or babies & automatically switch to drive mode. You can print a single image from video, but I can't attest to image quality. Face ID (the camera can 'memorize' faces) might be useful if you have kids, but I can't see using it much.Cons: There is much menu diving, especially to do the work arounds for tricky shots. I couldn't get Tracking AutoFocus to work well. No RAW and no choice of color space. The histogram display is post-shot only. It blows out highlights like crazy, but so did my S90. I confuse the shutter button with the on/off button sometimes, again just like my S90.In short, it's a better than average camera that can do a lot. If you are patient in setting up the work arounds to compensate for the lack of a Manual setting, you can get the trickier shots.  I wish the sharpness were more consistent across various types of shooting. But if you just want a camera for family/friends snap shots, the sharpness is excellent for that kind of photography.""
"20120608","3.0","Sharper, But Noisier Photos Than Some Others","I purchased the Canon ELPH 100 HS camera last year to try out the Canon HS System.  I was impressed with the relatively clean-looking images that can be taken in low light, compared to the noticeably noisy images taken with my older cameras.  However, when I zoomed in on parts of the images to look at details, the images were soft and lacking the detail I wanted.  The ELPH 100 HS also did not have an optical zoom for video - only a digital zoom, and only if the still image aspect ratio is set at 4:3.  I considered getting the ELPH 300 HS, which had a 24mm wide angle lens and which did have optical zoom for video, but I decided to go for the models with the newer DIGIC 5 processor, which Canon described as follows:'The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 16.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor in the PowerShot ELPH 110 HS digital camera incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low-light shooting, delivering clear, blur-free images.'Based on the representation that the DIGIC 5 processor 'provides a major boost in noise reduction,' I decided to pre-order the ELPH 110 HS at $249 on Amazon.com. - the 310 HS has a longer zoom lens range, but starts at 28mm and did not have the 24mm wider angle that I wanted.  The 110 HS is also available in black, whereas the 100 HS and the 310 HS did not have a black model.  The 310 HS also has the DIGIC 4 processor, not the newer DIGIC 5 processor that provided the 'major boost in noise reduction.'  Then I read the review by PC Magazine:'I used Imatest to measure the sharpness of photos captured by the Elph 110 HS, and the results were actually quite good. We consider a sharp image to be one that contains a center-weighted average of 1,800 lines per picture height, and the 110 HS exceeded that--recording 2,189 lines. In this regard the camera ran circles around the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH27 ($229.95, 2.5 stars), a camera that only managed 1,548 lines.High ISO performance was another matter entirely. We consider a clean image to be one that contains less than 1.5 percent noise. The Elph 110 HS was only able to keep noise under this threshold through ISO 200, a surprisingly low setting.  That said, it only registered about 1.6 percent at ISO 400 and ISO 800, so it isn't going to produce terribly grainy photos at higher ISO settings. That's the good news. The bad news is that the camera applies some pretty aggressive noise reduction to hit even these just-ok numbers. Detail is slightly diminished at ISO 400, but you can still make out textures and fine lines in the image. At ISO 800 it's bad, and at ISO 1600 it's pretty terrible--any semblance of texture is gone from your photo by that point.  The Canon PowerShot Elph 310 HS does a much better job both in terms of image noise and preservation of detail--it keeps noise under 1.5 percent through ISO 800, while managing to do a great job with image detail through ISO 400. At ISO 800 it's not that bad at all, although at ISO 1600 the 310 HS is also a victim of some heavy-handed noise reduction.. . . .The PowerShot Elph 110 HS is a good compact camera, but not a great one. Its lens is sharp, but Canon's decision to cram 16 megapixels onto a tiny sensor results in noisy images at higher ISO settings. The camera attempts to counteract this with noise reduction, but only serves to kill detail in photos at higher ISOs. This won't be a problem on smaller-size screens, but if you want to share your photos on larger LCDs or prints, the lack of texture and detail at higher ISO settings will be noticeable.Canon also turns out to be its own worst enemy here--if the PowerShot 310 HS wasn't available for a mere $10 more, the 110 HS would be easier to recommend. The 310 HS, which earned our Editors' Choice award for midrange compact cameras, features a nearly identical design and a more impressive 8x zoom lens. It does have fewer megapixels and its lens doesn't provide the extra-wide 24mm field of view of the 110 HS, but when you consider the noise reduction that the 110 HS requires to shoot images at ISO 800 and above, you really aren't losing much in terms of image quality when shooting in anything but bright light.'This review was disappointing - apparently, instead of producing a 'major boost in noise reduction,' the DIGIC 5 processor in the 110 HS was noisier than the DIGIC 4 processor in the 310 HS.  Now the question was whether I should cancel my pre-order of the 110 HS.  I put off the decision, because the 'release date' for the 110 HS was not until March 31, 2012.  On March 30, I noticed that the price had dropped by $20, so I decided to cancel my pre-order.  But then I saw that my order of the 110 HS at the original price of $249 was labeled as having been shipped, so it was too late to cancel.Since receiving the 110 HS on April 2, 2012, I have been using it as my everyday carry camera - it is as thin and light as my 100 HS.  The images taken in bright daylight look fine to me.  The images taken at higher ISOs do look a bit noisy, but they are sharper than the images taken with my 100 HS.  When I zoomed in on the images in the camera and on the computer, I could see more detail, even in the images taken indoors.  So there still is the trade off between sharpness and noise - on the balance, I prefer the additional sharpness that I get with the 110 HS, even though there is more noticeable noise.  In addition, the 110 HS provides the wider 24mm angle and provides optical zoom during video.Unfortunately, the 110 HS is the same as the 100 HS regarding the limitation on the use of digital zoom - digital zoom is only available at the 4:3 still image aspect ratio, while I prefer to shoot at the 3:2 still image aspect ratio to match the 4 X 6-inch prints that I usually order.  I was surprised to find that the images taken with the digital zoom looked better than the images taken at the maximum optical zoom and cropped on the computer to match the magnification of the digital zoom, so now I set the camera at the 4:3 still image aspect ratio with the digital zoom turned on in case I want to take quick snapshots with the digital zoom.  I compared images of a FedEx truck taken through an office opened window with the digital zoom of the 110 HS and with a 70-300mm (at 300mm or the 35mm equivalent of 450mm) lens on a Nikon D5100.  The image taken with the D5100 was less noisy and sharper than the image taken with the digital zoom of the 110 HS, but all of the letters and numbers on the side of the truck could be read in the digital zoom image taken with the 110 HS, except the Grumman name plate on the side of the truck, which could be read only in the image taken with the D5100.  I was pleased to learn that I could take usable photos with the 110 HS when I am not carrying the DSLR and zoom lens with me.If you are looking for a thin, light, and not too expensive everyday carry camera with reasonable sharpness, with a lens with the 24mm angle of view at the wide end of the zoom, and in the color black, the ELPH 110 HS may suit your needs.  I decided to keep the 110 HS, which is my fifth Canon compact camera (but the first one in black).  The 110 HS is a good compact camera that is my current everyday carry camera to have handy for quicky snapshots of various things and people, but, as PC Magazine said, it is 'not a great one.'  If images with lower noise are desired, there are other camera models around this price range and size that should be considered and, of course, there are more expensive cameras with bigger sensors that will provide images with lower noise.""
"20120607","4.0","Great, simple camera for a good price","We got this camera to have with us for quick shots of our new baby girl (due in the next few weeks).  We wanted something small but feature-packed and relatively inexpensive and this camera delivers on all of those.  I'm especially impressed with the image quality although I guess I should expect as much from a Canon since they have such amazing lenses.""
"20120604","4.0","Very nice camera","The best part about this product is its 24mm wide angle.  Probably one of the most accurate exposure P&S I've used. Decent(not perfect) flash photo indoor... better flash quality than most P&S I've used/tested. Only two complaints... 1) Shutter lags a bit (extra 3 to 5 seconds or so and that is a bit long) to use flash back to back, and 2) the price at $229 is a bit steep compared to other competitor models (&lt;$200) but I am happy with the extra I paid for the wide angle and Canon built quality.""

"20120531","5.0","Canon elph 110 hs does not come with a memory chip.","I bought the 110 because it does not have the touch screen as on the 320. Screens fade with time and in direct sun light that could be a problem for my eyes. I like that you can shoot your pictures in 16:1 wide screen. When you use a picture for the back ground on your desk top it is not distorted or cut off. Also displays perfectly on a flatscreen tv. The pictures so far have been great. Ability to shoot HD movies is a nice plus. Every where you go on the internet people talk about how much better digital SLR cameras are. I like little cameras because I can have this in my pocket to use or not. No questions about why you are bringing a camera along and all that. It has been my experience that people are less shy about being in a photo when the camera is small. The camera does NOT come with a memory chip! Buy a class 10 SD XC Transcend chip. XC is a better choice over HC. 16GB OR 32GB are good sizes. HD movies use huge amounts of memory. The way I understand it 16GB will hold about 1 hour of HD video and less if you already have pitures in the camera.""

"20120516","5.0","Lovely Little Camera: Incredibly Easy to Use, Fantastic Photos and Video","I'd previously had the IS1400, and loved it -- so sleek -- but it was co-opted by a family member. Figuring this was a sign from the cosmos that I should update for an upcoming trip abroad, I checked out tons of cameras, and almost went with a similar Panasonic that had just come out. In any case, the 110 won out for the simple reason that it boasted not only terrific specs (HD video and a healthy pixel count for photos) and was truly pocketable, but because it did NOT have a touch screen. Many people had commented negatively on the absence of dedicated buttons for accessing menus and prior photos, and I have to agree with them: you don't want to be futzing with a touch-screen just to quickly access a capability that a dedicated button would instantly allow, especially in strong daylight.The photos and video I took (over 2000 so far) in full daylight have been nothing short of stunning, much better than the already-terrific IS1400. If this is your main use, don't hesitate. Photos in modest lighting were also quite good, due to the new sensor and specialized Low Light setting. Night photos were again better than the last generation, but not nearly so good as a camera designed for that capability (e.g., the S90-95-100 series).Even though the camera is tiny -- you can carry it in your pocket and literally forget it's there -- there were a couple of very minor drawbacks. First, it's somewhat boxy in shape; the IS1400 was incredibly slim, with rounded edges. The 110 is very thin, but entirely rectangular, with squared-off corners. Second, the battery lasts for about 200-300 shots. This is sufficient for lots of situations, but not if you cannot recharge it daily, or even more often; I took along a spare (easily obtainable for 1/5 the Canon price from multiple vendors), and am glad I did. Lastly, the screen isn't touch-capable. For that, it seems you'd need to give up the dedicated buttons, which I absolutely didn't want to do. All very minor, as I said.If you're looking for an idiot-proof, truly pocketable camera that takes first-rate photos and HD video, you won't be disappointed. Just buy an extra battery and try to get as much ambient light on your subjects as possible.""
"20120506","5.0","superb camera!","I got a few compact digital cameras(Nikon/Canon/ as part of my little collections of gadgets) and this model is outstanding as with performance, although it doesn't look as handsome or classy as the others.  It's really a surprise to see the stunning clarity of the pictures, as opposed to what one reviewer said. Try this 'not so nice' looking camera, if you can, and you would be amazed.""
"20120430","4.0","Good for what it is","The first thing to keep in mind:  this is a little 'point and shoot' - not a DSLR.  If you're accustomed to the image quality of a DSLR, you might be a little disappointed with the Elph.On the other hand, if you want web images and the usual smaller prints, this will do the job nicely.It has two modes - a full automatic, and a Program mode that allows users to have some control of the camera (which still retains some automatic functions).Color accuracy is great.  Sharpness is very good at ISO 100, pretty good at ISO 200.  After that, the camera's aggressive noise reduction decreases sharpness as the ISO speed increases.  So if you want to take indoor 'available light' shots, don't expect too much detail.Something I don't like:  it has a longer shutter response lag than other 'point & shoots' I've had.  That makes it harder to catch action and fleeting candid shots.Another concern is the quirky file naming system - the camera wants to write the images to daily or monthly folders.  Why?At first, I'd remove the memory card and plug it into the computer - using Windows to transfer / import the images.  I have since started using the supplied USB cord and the 'Camera Window' software (supplied on the CD).  That seems to yield more consistent results.One more nit to pick:  a printed 'Getting Started' guide is included, but the larger manual is only on the enclosed CD (Adobe Acrobat format).  Looking up something is rather tedious.I'll give this camera four stars, but I feel a little generous in doing so......""
"20120427","5.0","Stunning Pictures","In preparing for a trip to a remote area of East Africa, I needed a camera that would fit in my pocket. I have a nice Canon Rebel with all the lenses, but the fear was that if I packed that in my luggage it would be stolen, and it is too bulky to fit in my very limited carry on bag. I purchased the Canon Powershot in the hopes that it would take reasonable pictures. My expectations were that it would not do as well as what I had come to expect with my full size Canon.The bottom line was that I was blown away with the picture quality and functionality of the camera. I was shocked at the brilliance, contrast and sharpness of the images. I took several thousand pictures on the trip and did not get one bad shot.Also due to limited space in my carry on bag, I was not able to take a separate video camcorder. I was pleasantly surprised with the video and sound quality from this small unit.Very rarely have I been as pleased with a product as I am with this one. It gets my enthusiastic recommendation!""
"20120423","5.0","Quality Camera, Great Pictures and Videos, Great Price","This was a quality purchase and I did a huge amount of research as well as visiting and speaking with reps at both Best Buy and Frys. And I would've actually bought on Amazon had I had more time before going on vacation but I bought it at Frys Electronics.First off, I did many comparisons to other Canons recently released. This camera has all of the features of the 320HS except for the WiFi and the touch screen. This camera is identical except for those two features. And at the time of this purchase, those features were $30 more on that camera. But I also considered that the possibility of hardware failures increases the more features you add. Also, I didn't want to 'miss a moment' waiting for the lag of a touch screen. I wanted to be able to push a button and have the picture snap. I also hate giving the camera to someone to snap a group photo and them not knowing where to touch on the screen. The traditional shutter button was a plus in my book.As for other features, I did a side by side comparison of the 520HS, 320HS, 310HS and 530HS. I opted for a higher resolution and a lower optical zoom because but with the Digic5 processor because, for casual photos, 5x optical should be sufficient. If I want to get a higher resolution with a greater optical zoom, I will just upgrade to a DSLR camera.I've also owned Canon's for many years and I was happy with previous versions. With the 110HS I took a couple hundred shots on a recent vacation and several videos in HD. The videos came out great with good sound quality for a point and shoot. And the photos were exceptional for the price point.Personally I also like the auto focus features and the fact that it seems to calculate exposures and makes adjustments when I don't have the flash on. I did find that turning the flash off gives a much more natural look and with it on my photo subjects seemed to run 'hot' so I opted to have it off except in low light situations. The button configuration to toggle the flash on and off is both ergonomic and intuitive.Additionally, the menus are standard Canon-type, so if you are used to them, you will enjoy a familiar interface. If you are not used to Canon cameras, it won't take long to learn.Also, the quality of the hardware is good overall, but it does have a sort of plastic-ish feel. Not bad, as it keeps it lightweight, but be aware that some may find it chintzy feeling. I, personally, think it feels light and nice. The battery lasted for about 2 days taking a combination of videos and pictures but I always kept it off and in the storage case (for power conservation) when not in use.Finally, I do have to admit again that I bought the camera at Fry's Electronics in Burbank due to the fact that I was going on vacation the very next day. I bought the SquareTrade warranty direct from SquareTrade, which I felt was a great deal for about $50 bucks for 3 years. It's the same on Amazon's site or going through them but you cannot get the 2 year warranty if you go through SquareTrade directly and it seems you can get 2 years full coverage on Amazon, which I would have preferred.All in all, this is a quality camera with a reasonable battery life, good quality pictures and videos with an intuitive interface. I give it 5-stars and am very happy with my purchase.PS: I also got a SDHC 16 gig card, class 10 and it seems to be pretty speedy. I'd recommend getting one of those or larger as this camera does not include storage. Also look at picking up some sort of a case. I bought a CaseLogic case with a plush interior (from K-Mart for $10) and am happy with that as well.""

I didn't like how photos came out in low lighting the auto light just seems to not work to my liking. It does take great outdoors photos.
