"20120525","5.0","Great camera for the money.","Just bought it for my 7 y.o. Easy, great pics and 720p videos.For the price it takes good pics, easy to use, just a perfect next step for the kids.In fact if you are not pretending to be  'a pro' but want to shot some quick family /kids /situation photos and do not want to study the manual for 2 weeks, this camera takes much better pics/video/panoramas  than the smart phones, is small and light and you can just Point and Shot wihtout setting up things for 5 min first. So if you want something easy and really inexpensive -this one is a good one.I recomended for 'non serious' photographer.99 y.o. grandma can operate it and take good shots of kids.If you are looking for $100 range camera-do not compare it to SLR...unless you find one for $100""
"20120521","5.0","GREAT CAMERA","THIS IS A WONDERFUL CAMERA.  NOT SURE WHAT THE OTHER REVIEW PERSON IS TALKING ABOUT IT LOOKS LIKE A TOY. IT IS REALLY NICE SLIM AND HAS SO MANY NICE FEATURES. i BOUGHT THIS SO WHEN THE IPHONE 5 COMES OUT I DONT NEED IT.  I HAVE A 4 AND WANTED TO UPGRADE FOR THE CAMERA. SO I DECIDED THIS CAMERA IS JUST GREAT. LOVE THE ZOOM AND PANARAMIC MODE IS FUN. FOR A POINT AND SHOOT THIS IS GREAT.  I LOVE THIS CAMERA  I DONT THINK YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. ITS GREAT FOR FAMILY FUN SHOTS AND TO HAVE A CAMERA AROUND .""
"20120427","2.0","Initial Reaction & Then I'll Update This","I'm charging the battery as I write this, but have a gut reaction to this camera.  It is made of plastic, and looks like a toy.  I showed a friend without saying a word about it. He held it and immediately said, 'This looks like a toy.'  It is light and has no substance to it.  Looks pretty cheap, and I don't like it at all.I'll update this when I use it, but very disappointed so far.UPDATE:  Returning this camera.  The photos are not as sharp as I expected.""
