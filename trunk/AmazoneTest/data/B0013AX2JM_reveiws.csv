"20110622","5.0","Just got back into PSP gaming","I hadn't touched my PSP in a long while. Like almost 3 years. But after Sony announced the 'Welcome Back' rewards program, and with me coincidentally having much more free time around the time of that program, I decided to pick up some PSP games. Only problem was I only had a 1gb memory stick (which wasn't enough to fit the two free PSP games I selected from the welcome back program), so I decided to buy a new memory stick.The price on this product was fair, but in light of the push for digital content on the PSP, I was a little surprised that the 16 and 8gb models were so expensive. If you're not sure if 4gb will be enough for you, I suppose you could rationalize the purchase of the 8 or 16gb models because the larger memory sticks don't seem to substantially depreciate in value. Probably because all the memory sticks are compatible with Sony cameras. So if you do make the splurge for the bigger memory sticks it's not like you won't be able to get a fair return on your money once you're finished gaming on the PSP.The product really couldn't be an easier to use. You simply pop it in your system and you're ready to start copying games to your PSP. Right now I have 3 games on my memory stick and I still have a significant amount of space remaining.Overall, it's worth the money. Do yourself a favor and spend the money to buy a real and officially licensed Sony memory stick from Amazon rather than buying this product off an auction site where you're likely to get a knock-off.""

"20110620","3.0","The Sony card performs as claimed.","I bought this Sony Memory Stick getting a fair price. However, shortly after I purchased this item I saw an offer for about 5 bucks less. It was delivered promptly, and performs as claimed. I was able to use the card timely-wise, so the 5 dollar savings if I had waited was a minor irritation.I subsequently discovered that Sony Flash memory is not compatible with all readers. I experienced this when showing video on my son's PS3. His older series Sony Flash memory card works well on the reader he uses, but this newer Sony 'Pro' series did not play video smoothly from his reader. He then produced another reader which is not compatible with his older card but was with my newer card. Fortunately, my reader, a Targus, purchased at Walmart for about 10 bucks is compatible with both Sony flash series. I lucked out.Buyer beware of compatibility issues regarding card readers and various Sony flash memory series. Video may not play properly on all card readers. Regarding other Sony products I own, I am learning that Sony is becoming notorious for disregarding compatibility and obsolescence issues regarding users' past investments in its products. Sony's recent stock price declines are reflecting the investor's realization of Sony's arrogance regarding consumer preferences. If Sony chooses to continue down this path, it will inevitably be bought out by some Korean upstart more cognizant of consumer needs and less concerned about patting itself on the back for innovation.""

"20101029","1.0","All I got was a counterfeit memory stick","I ordered 16 gb memory stick only to find out that I received a counterfeit memory stick.The reasons are as follows:The printing on the packaging is a very low quality as if someone printed the packaging on a color laser printer.  The paper used didn't even have a decent quality (i.e. a weight of 25 or more lbs).I ordered a 16 gb memory stick and 16 gb is printed on the memory stick itself however the packaging on the back states 'Usable capacity is approx. 7.5 GB'Upon opening the package, the slip containing the instructions as well as my rights to the warranty WAS NOT IN THE PACKAGE.The model number printed on the packaging is different from the model number printed on the memory stick.  Packaging: MS-MT16G, Memory Stick: MSLY-M16GBMy Sony devices did not detect the memory stick.I called Amazon customer service as soon as I got the memory stick.  I informed the agent that the product I received was counterfeit based on the reasons stated above.  The customer service agent stated that Amazon will investigate the product but I doubt I will hear back from them regarding the product that I received.I, however, will be returning the product through Amazon.The buyer should beware when it comes to purchasing memory.

First off, the estimated date of arrival was not actuate at all which wasn't bad but kind of got my hopes up for nothing. Also,I received the package on the very last day which was better later then never. Second once i got the package the memory card worked great. I upgraded the psp to the latest version and did a whole bunch of downloading. Rather then the memory card having 16gb of memory it had 15GB but that is because all flash drives and memory cards and junk have some kind of special stuff on them hidden and saved so that they work right or something. So if anyone wanted to know how much memory you are truly get it is 15Gb. Third, the speed of the memory card is fast (but i have nothing to truly compare it to). Last, I like the memory card size because it is large enough to put a hand full of movies, a ton of music and games, or a mix of all of those combined and have an amazing multi-media device with a built in web browser, skype, internet radio, and much more...""

I purchased mine through an Amazon seller, One Flash, because they stated they would ship within 24 hours.  Not only did they not ship within 24 hours, but when I did receive it (only 12 hours before I was leaving on vacation), the card was counterfeit.  It was not defective, it was FAKE.  I contacted One Flash who said they would issue a refund immediately on return. They received the return 7/12 and as of 7/23 I still have no refund & NO COMMUNICATION from them despite 3 additional contact attempts from me.  I filed an Amazon A-Z guarantee claim, but still no refund yet.I was forced to go to Best Buy to buy another card (at a higher price) so I would have a card for my camera (also purchased on Amazon) for my vacation.  By the way, the camera - a Sony HX1 - is AWESOME!Amazon has no control over what their Sellers ship, so that's not Amazon's fault.  Hopefully I will get my refund with the A-Z guarantee, because I'd hate to think that the $50 in Amazon gift cards that my children got me for Fathers Day were stolen by a disreputable merchant.FOLLOW-UP - I never heard from the seller, but Amazon's A-Z guarantee refunded my gift cards to my account, so all I lost was the relatively insignificant return shipping.  THANKS, AMAZON, FOR BEING SUCH A TRUSTWORTHY SOURCE!!!  Rest assured, even if an Amazon retail partner isn't trustworthy, Amazon IS!But the bottom line is - when buying an item like this that is so commonly counterfeited, BE SURE TO BUY DIRECT FROM AMAZON, not through one of their Sellers.  That way if there is a problem, you are dealing directly with Amazon and don't have to worry about a third party.  I'm also guessing it is less likely that Amazon would sell a counterfeit item than some of their sellers.""

As we wanted First Class shipping, we found this Seller to be closer and indeed, the product arrived only three days after we ordered it.We had purchased a Sony CyberShot camera on Amazon for them for their anniversary and they had talked us out of getting the Memory Card/Stick as they were sure they could find one locally. However after being sold two incorrect ones by their local Best Buy, on the third trip they were further frustrated to find that Best Buy wanted TWICE as much for these as Amazon. As I had offered to get them one to begin with, I immediately ordered it from ABX ProTECH on Amazon and they had it in an amazing three days, in time for their snowy southern weekend.Sony is like Dell, they design products so you must use brand-specific accessories, etc., with them for optimum results. My son did not want me to down-rate the camera (as others have) due to this as he stated it is just 'good old capitalism.' While it can be a pain at times, and also more expensive at times, we have used Sony cameras and camera products for years, and have had excellent results.However if you need one of these to arrive in a reasonable amount of time, I advise shopping around the different Amazon Sellers who carry these and find one who is closer to you to overcome shipping time. Many of them are within a few cents of each other in price (when you figure in the differing shipping costs) and the ours arrived at our son's home much faster than it would have if we would have purchased from a Seller on the West Coast.All in all, our son and daughet-in-law are happy with it, so we are happy with our purchase.

It was for the new camera I bought my wife and was pretty excited to show her that she need not worry about maxing out the card when recording on HD!  All that fizzled the moment I put the card in.  Camera threw an error and when I searched on net - The memory stick is a Fake.HDMI King was quick to acknowledge when I emailed them.  They have asked me to send the product back for full refund including return shipping.Looking at the internet I figured that Sony Memory sticks are plagued by these fakes. Good Luck to anyone buying them cheap these days!!!As for me, I have decided to buy 4GB card for same $35.  Atleast that would be a genuine product.""

I'm going to stand by my previous judgment and say that the Sony PSP is the best music player I've ever gotten my hands on. The iPod and iPod touch have nothing on the PSP for music playing.This is not, however, a PSP review, but a memory stick review. A very good memory stick with more storage than any other memory stick. Remember how HDDs advertise how many thousands of songs and hundreds of movies they can hold?

This has been the most seamless experience with memory devices that I have found.8GB is an excellent deal considering the large amount of media added on the PSN store for the PSP.

I have full use of my camera and tons of memory, so I can take more pictures and movies because of the Memory Stick Pro.  I love it because it works and I don't have to think about it.  Put it in, take pics or videos, pull it out, upload to computer and its all good.

I bought it strictly for brand loyalty. Im very well aware the iPhone 4S (currently the best resolution camera on a cell) would take much better pics and videos, but at least I can store my personal pics and videos on this card and not on my computer or tv where anyone can quickly access them if I were to leave it unattended for a couple of minutes and forget to set the lock.

But this was so annoying because every time you switch on the cam this would be the welcome note. so i called sony and they asked me to give them the model number written on the stick. they said that this model number is non-existent. then they asked me to give them the one written on the package which matched. they called it 'counterfeit' product and advised me to return it to the seller. Sadly, i had purchased two sticks. seller did not respond so filed a dispute with paypal. shipped item back per paypal recommendations (refund still pending).Then i purchased this item from Amazon for $85.

While 1GB may be a little to small nowadays to hold massive amounts of music, not to mention games (and photos if you're using this for a camera), the price for a 1 gig - compared to the other MS's (at the time I purchased this) is absolutely hilarious! Why get a 1 gig when you can get quadruple for the same price!?!? (Yes, 1GB=~$15.00; 2GB=~$8.00; 4GB=~$15.00!) I see no reason to get a 1 gig.. Well maybe except for making a cheap Magic Memory Stick...

Videos its snappy to, when switching it only takes about a second to think before it displays the next video.  I converted some DVDs I own to the highest quality video you can watch on a PSP and it fills up this memory stick up fast. AKA 1.3GB per file at 480x272 resolution @1500Kbps.  You can size that down of course, but your memory stick at 4GB will fill up fast. But overall, if you're looking for a hefty space to fill up with music, photos, and small videos get this.

Thinking that Sony Customer Support representatives should know what their products are compatible with, I requested to speak to a different representative.

The included adapter, however, is just another in a long line of cables, connectors, CD's, trinkets, tidbits and what-ya-ma-call-its that I'll have to keep up with.... but I've come to expect that in this, the age of small digital gadgets.""

It wasn't shipped until the day after that communication.It's worth the extra few dollars to purchase from a more local seller.""

"20090115","3.0","I may have gotten a fake one too","First of all, they got my order wrong.I ordered a Sony MSXM8GS 8 GB Memory Stick PRO Duo (Retail Package) on 12/23/08.I received a Sony MS-MT 8GB Memory Stick PRO Duo (Mark2) almost a month later, today, 01/14/09.The packaging seems fishy to me.  I bought enough SONY products to know its authenticity.  For example, in the upper right hand corner of the packaging, there is printed 'MS-MT' follwed by a hologram sticker of SONY.  Upon reading other reviews, I was willing to bet that the hologram sticker was there as a cover-up.  so I peeled back the sticker to uncover a '16G' an obvious misprint on a packaging that displays '8 GB' on the lower right hand corner.  A genuine SONY product will never have such obvious mistakes in the packaging.Also, the prints just don't seem sharp and crisp, not high quality.The package was shipped from China.At this point I'm pretty sure I got a knock-off that looks just like the real thing.  the packaging indicates a 5 year warranty, but there is no certificate or registration form.The good thing is that it works.The bad thing is that I'm afraid the workmanship and quality is not there.""

The description does not mention it, but my card came with an adapter so it can be used in a standard memory stick slot.It was worth the premium to go to a larger size to cut down on card swapping.

It stores the JPG files pretty fast so that you can continue shooting.Same thing with the video shoothing. A couple of days ago, I was in a BBQ with some frieds and we have a band playing live music.

After that I got this 8 Gb card and I have never had the need to 'delete stuff' again.If you are buying a PSP, don't waste your time or money with less than 8 Gigs. You won't regret it.""
"20080927","5.0","As described.","It works as described, seems very quick for data transfer in my PSP, and as for memory cards I'd rather have a Sony brand then some knock-off that dies in a month.""
"20080925","5.0","Works on my Sony Ericsson W810i phone","After searching around on forums and review board, I couldn't find anything about whether this 16 gig memory card would work with my Sony Ericsson W810i cellphone/walkman (AT&T/Cingular version), so I thought I would go out on a limb and try it.Well I am happy to report that it does work with this phone, but there are a few things that I would like to share. From the Settings Menu, the phone does not display anything over 4 gigs, but that just seems to be limitation of that menu itself (perhaps a 'fixed odometer' number) because the phone can see the entire contents of the 16 gig memory card, as I loaded 13 gigs of MP3s and had no trouble playing any of them. (Just for note, I inserted the card into the phone, and let it inititalize it. I then removed it and loaded my MP3s from my PC via memory card port on my printer since the transfer rate is much faster than transfering through the phone.)Since installing the card, there are a few things that are slower in comparision to my previous 4 gig memory card. Turning the phone on takes about 45 seconds to complete. This is not a really a huge problem for me since I normally leave my cell phone on all the time anyways, and if I needed to turn it on in a hurry I'd just remove the memory card. Also, browsing into my MP3s is about the same, but going back a folder level when browsing takes about 5 seconds to complete. I attribute all of this to the large size of the memory card and the phone having to scan it all. The newfound 'lag' I believe is the fault of the phone being a few years old when the largest Pro Duo card at the time was a 4 gig.I don't attribute any issues being with the memory card itself. The memory card itself works as advertised and have had no issues with it. Its a really nice option to have 16 gigs of music right there on your phone.""

"20080528","4.0","Works Great Just Like Any SD Card, Except only for Sony Products","I gave this 4 stars as it is like Olympus/Fuji with xD cards.  It is quite unfair and not very nice that these companies have these proprietary items that are only for their products and usually at a premium price over the standard SD or Compact Flash cards that fit a variety of cameras.Read/Write speeds are average and for me fine, some want SDHC class 6 or 8 and those are faster but usually much more expensive and I bet with a Sony name attached even more so.I have taken photos with the camera and used the adaptor to download to laptop desktop and printer directly for printing.In any case this card performs as expected, Sony tosses in a holder and that can convert to the standard SD slots on your computer or printer in many cases but not all.  In my case I also have a Sony laptop in which it has a card reader for the Sony sticks.  Shop around as I paid much less then I would have at a store.""
"20080515","5.0","Bought this for my PSP","This is currently the only available 16GB Memory Stick. I bought it for my Playstation Portable in order to replace an 8GB Memory Stick.Regarding the price you can easily argue that it is much cheaper to buy two 8GB Memory Sticks. And for any person who is concerned about spending money I would not recommend this product.At the time I bought it, Amazon was offering the best price online. Regarding the fact that this Memory Stick is about $50 more expensive than the PSP itself, makes you think twice. But my sole purpose was that I wanted to keep things together: my music, videos and saved games etc.This Memory Stick is large enough to satisfy my thirst for disc space with a single solution.The Memory Stick works fine in my PSP. Before this one I used a Sandisk 8GB Memory Stick Pro Ultra and I cannot see a difference in read/write speed (while connected through USB to my PC).Final thoughts:If you are concerned about spending money and you can live with more than one MS for your gadgets, you should get two or more 8GB MS. If you want a single solution and price is of no matter, get this one. Since it is from Sony you can be sure it works with your MS-enabled gadgets.Pro:- high capacity- read/write speed is up to par with other (higher ranked) memory sticks  (using the PSP USB connection!)Con:- not cheap5 out of 5 stars; simply because the price does not matter to me(My guess is that the price will drop to about $150 once other manufactures offer similar capacity.)""
