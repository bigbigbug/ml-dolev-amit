"20120612","5.0","Love it!","I got this camera just last week and so far have been impressed!  Its a great size - definitely bigger than your average point and shoot but much smaller than the SLR cameras out there.  In other words, exactly what you would expect from this type of camera.  I am using this camera for basic everyday things and am hoping to learn some of the more intricate features over time.  I wanted something that I could use for mainly taking pictures of my kids.  I wanted to be able to be some distance away from them and still get great shots (for example - at swim lessons when they are on the other side of the pool).  Basically capture those moments when they aren't posing or noticing you are right there, but instead are completely enthralled in their activity and you can get that picture that shows the look of joy on their faces or the concentration they are putting into what they are doing.  Those pictures are hard to get when you have to be close with your average point and shoot.  In just the few days I have had the camera I have gotten some of the best pictures!A couple of features I have played with:1.  Background defocus - have loved the way you can blur out the background on things that aren't that interesting.2.  Sequence shooting - where pressing the button once, you get multiple shots at one time.  It really captures movement well.3.  Panoramic shooting - haven't used this with great scenery like I plan to this summer, but have practiced some and its a really neat feature.  Very stable.I'm far from an accomplished photographer, just someone who wanted to get something a little more advanced than what I had, but like I said, so far, its been impressive.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in something in between the more expensive SLR and the point and shoots.  I can tell that I am going to be very pleased with this camera for years to come!""
"20120612","4.0","It's Not Perfect","I bought this camera as a replacement for my old DSC-R1 which takes great pictures, but which is too heavy and bulky to be carrying around in museums and churches. I wanted clear, sharp images in low light situations, and the HX200V is wonderful for foolproof images. An unexpected bonus is its panorama and movie capabilities. I find I am using them more than I had ever expected.What don't I like? Three things. 1)The lens cover is terrible. 2)I want a detailed manual in hard copy. 3)The EV indicator is nearly invisible.""
"20120607","4.0","Fast fun super zoom with disappointing omissions.","I'm enjoying this camera for it's insane optical zoom coverage and incredible speed. It's easy to use, has some fun features and feels great in hand. My NEX-5N feels like a pocket camera after getting used to holding this thing. I'm a very experienced photography/camera geek, so I don't fool around with manuals and I don't need them. Did not miss the printed manual. Just spend an hour with your camera and see what all the options are.The Good:- Huge zoom range in a cheap, small, and light package.- LIGHTNING FAST focusing. Really makes my 5N feel kind of sluggish by comparison. And actually some DSLRs for that matter.- Huge grip. This thing feels so nice to hold.- Articulating LCD and thumb dial on the back. I love how you just click the thumb dial to switch between ISO, aperture and shutter speed (or exposure compensation).- The viewfinder helps when shooting outdoors.- GPS is an awesome feature for a camera like this. Sony really understands the kind of people who will be using this camera.The Bad:- No way to disable noise reduction. At moderate ISOs, aggressive noise reduction destroys image sharpness. If you're spoiled by your DSLR and a sharp lens, you'll want to stick around base ISO with this camera (and even ISO 100 looses detail to noise reduction).- Along the same lines, no RAW. The previous issue would be forgivable if I had some way of still retaining all the data so that I may run my own noise reduction (or none at all). Why not, really?- No way to disable auto review. Every time you snap a shot, the screen goes black for a moment and then your last shot appears. You can interrupt this by pressing the shutter button half way. I'm not interested auto review since I can see what the shot is going to look like before I even take the picture. This means a half shutter press in between each photo for me. it often causes me to loose track of my subject. I can't remember the last camera I used that didn't allow you to disable auto review.- No focus lock by holding the shutter halfway between shots  I also can't remember using a camera that didn't have this feature. Pretty much every camera from the cheapest point and shoot to the most expensive camera with keep focus (and sometimes exposure) locked between shots as long as you keep the shutter pressed half way between shots. This is definitely an intentional omission. Why? I have no idea.- I can't even set my own white balance in video? Yup, if you want to shoot video with this camera, it's auto white balance or nothing. Which will mean the occaiosonal blue video that could have been easily prevented with a selection from the menu.- SLUGGISH image zoom in review mode. If you want to check your focus, it takes a while for the camera to zoom in on your picture or some strange reason. Not so on my NEX. On the 5N, I can just tap the screen to magnify the picture and check sharpness.The UGLY:- Image quality at about ISO 400 and above. Do not get this camera if you're looking for low light performance. That is not what it's for. This camera is for taking photos in broad daylight. This is a great camera for sight seeing and takng wide shots and panoramas of tourist attractions. It's a great camera to take on a hike or to the zoo. Zoom in and capture the shot, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. My advice is to use this camera in the sunlight or with the flash unless you're noti concerned with image quality and sharpness or are just going to post your photos on Facebook of Instagram.- All the feature omissions for no other conceivable purpose than to torture enthusiasts. No raw, no disabling auto review, no focus lock, and no white balance in video.Conclusion:Do you ever use your cell phone to take pictures? This is WAY better than a cell phone and in some ways, better than any DSLR setup that YOU could afford. The image quality is about point and shoot level... Better than cell phone quality, but closer to that than DSLR quality.However, what this camera is all about is the lens. The image quality of your DSLR doesn't matter if you can't afford an 800mm lens. In many cases the HX200V can simply capture images that would take a multi-thousand dollar DSLR rig to capture. And when you've got your DSLR sitting there with it's stunning low light abilities and raw files, you're still limited by the reach of your lens. If you're at the zoo with a d7000 and kit lens, trying to get a photo of a far off animal, you're not going to have a very sharp and detailed picture once you crop it down to what you had in mind.It's in these cases that the HX200V is going to kill medium zooms on SLRs. Even with it's lack of RAW and destructive noise supression, it's optical ability to get into the subject is going to insure you have way more 'data' of your subject than you would with a shorter lens.It should also be mentioned that this camera is obviously geared towards gadget freaks more than photographers. There are so many fun and gimmicky features like panorama, picture effects, and even 3D that it's obvious this camera is being marketed towards the iPad crowd.For what it is, it's a great camera. I think I'll have a lot of fun hiking with it and taking it to the zoo. It could never replace my 5N when it comes to image quality though and I do have to emphasize that the intentional handicapping of this camera by omitting enthusiast features is a disappointment. It does deserve at least four stars for what it does at this price.""
"20120606","5.0","Love this camera!","As an amateur photography enthusiast, I am not able to give a detailed technical review as others have don.  However, I love this camera and enjoy using it.  The controls are well placed so that you can react quickly to a photo op.  It focuses quickly and I find it almost impossible to get an out-of-focus photo.  This includes taking pictures from a moving car.  I was pleased to see the dedicated movie button.  Videos are clear and detailed and the sound is accurate.  I especially appreciate the viewfinder which allows me to frame the actual picture I want.  It also handles both pro duo and sd memory sticks.  I had been using the HX1 with a 20x zoom (with grainier video), but the 30x zoom on this was irresistible.""
"20120603","4.0","I like this camera","I am a part time professional photographer.  When I go on vacation, I don't want to carry all my expensive and heavy equipment.  I was looking for something that will allow me to get good vacations shots and not have to worry that there will be a problem with the pictures or the camera.I got this Sony for just that reason and I have put it through the paces to see how it performs.In general I would say it does a fine job.  Pictures are clear and useable for prints and Facebook and the same goes for the videos.I always turn off any digital or software zoom on the camera.  I figure Photoshop and Lightroom can do a better job than the camera's firmware.  With that said, the 30x zoom performs very well.One of the tests I did was to take some pictures of license plates of cars more than 100 feet away with the 30x zoom.  Not only was the license plate numbers clear, I could read the numbers (easily) on the registration stickers.  So while it wasn't as sharp and my expensive lens might have shot, for this kind of camera, I was pretty pleased.The videos were nice and clear and I could not detect and sound from the lens when zooming during the video.  Focus stayed locked on until I had zoomed to 30x on something only a foot away.  But I wouldn't expect to actually have worked.The thing I personally like the most is the live histogram.  You get this by turning on more information as a display option.  I think it actually works better as a light meter indicating what range of values you would get if you shoot the picture. Most cameras will give you a histogram of the shot after you take the photo.This camera has another interesting feature.  Both a view finder and a rear display.  It also senses when you are using the finder and turns off the display as to not draw your focus from the view finder.  This is a nice feature.There are a few things I don't like.  The camera 'feels' cheap.  It is made of plastic and just feels like it will break if you drop it.  The automatic settings seem to choose high ISO values even in bright light. And one thing this camera doesn't do well is control the amount of noise in high ISO pictures.  However, there is a setting on the camera to reduce noise after taking the shot, but this adds about 2-3 seconds to each picture and unless you are in multi-picture mode, the camera is as slow as most point and shoot cameras.  I also wish there was a raw mode.There are a bazillion photo effects, but I never use any.  If I want to do that, I do it outside the camera.Though auto works okay, I would suggest shooting in P or M mode with the live histogram.  But no matter what mode you shoot in, you can take some very nice pictures and video with this camera.  Just don't drop it.""
"20120601","3.0","A little bit disappointed","First thing first, I know is not a DSLR and was not expecting to have similar pictures. Now, I got this camera because of 3 key features:1. High ISO levels2. 3D pictures3. Long zoom4. Still captures while shooting videoThis camera is 12800 ISO, which means that you can take pictures in extremely low light conditions, usually you cannot go to the max ISO level in any camera because it takes really noisy pictures; in such case I usually expect at least one step before max (6400 ISO in this case), well this camera's pictures have a strong presence of noise even in 2000 ISO (sometimes even at 1600 ISO is really noisy); and is not just noise but also is not sharp at all.3D pictures are barely ok, I tried another smaller point and shoots cameras for 3D (a Samsung) that take better 3D pictures, this one kind of lacks of depth perception.The zoom is actually really good, I cannot say anything bad about it, the zoom range pretty good and enough for most situations.Still captures while shooting video are, again, just ok. Usually they don't have enough light at certain conditions.Some good features is the bunch of presets that are part of the menu for those people that doesn't either like or know how to set manual mode, the support for both SD/Pro Duo memory cards, the face/blink detection mechanism, the ergonomic position of the buttons, etc.I wonder if I should put an extra $300 and get the Nikon 1 combo with two lenses which is not 3D but it might take better pictures (because of the sensor size) and is less bulky.""
"20120530","5.0","It works well!!","The camera i bought the other day is really good!It zoom tremendously. As a beginner of this kind of camera, i really am satisfied it. I use often very much when i go out.""
"20120524","5.0","Has features that others do not.","There are three cameras that one should consider the Canon Powershot SX40 the Panasonic DMC FX150 and then this one the Sony HX200V.Researching these three is interesting because you will find sites listing each of the three as the very best over the other two.  I think the bottom line is that any of the three will give good photos and satisfy the user.I purchased this camera because of two features that are largely ignored by the professional reviewers but to me they give this camera the edge over the others.  First is Sony's proprietary optical steady shot stabilization.  A good stabilization system is extremely important because no matter what the camera if you don't have good stabilization or a tripod then you have fuzzy pictures.  Here is what Techradar had to say in their review of the HX200V;  'We got sharp results at maximum zoom from shot to subsequent shot when it was used handheld. That's almost unheard of on rival models.  On most superzoom rivals we've needed to take two or three shots of the same subject to arrive at one that wasn't soft.'  The reader should go to the Techradar site review and then go to SAMPLE IMAGES.  The first photo is taken at wide angle and shows a long tree lined path ending at a distant white building.  The next photo was taken handheld at the same spot but now at full telephoto and WOW.  You now clearly see a fence that you did not see before and the paint is rusted in spots and there is an emblem on the fence that you can read.  Also go to SENSITIVITY AND NOISE.  Here you can see how the level of noise at different ISO settings effects the photos.  Which brings me to another subject.  Some professional reviewers point out that higher megapixels do not necessarily mean better photos because noise can increase depending on the CMOS sensor which is true but then they are completely baffled at why the Sony engineers increased the megapixels on this new camera.  Well I'm not sure either however I am sure they didn't make the camera worse than the competition but rather better.My second reason for selecting this camera is the Superior Auto Mode. This mode shoots multiple shots of the same scene in rapid sequence and then creates the best single picture as a composite Here is what Squidoo says in their review; 'Get cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The DSC-HX200V automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot.'  If you Google tumblr HX200v you will see sample photos of the Superior Auto Mode which are impressive.So did the camera meet my expectations, yes it did.  The stabilization worked as advertised however the lens does have limitations.  It works best in bright light.  The alternative would be stepping up to a more expensive and larger Digital SLR camera along with lens.  For example Canon has a 800mm lens to fit the more the expensive cameras but it is 18 inches long weights 10 pounds and costs $13,499.00.The Superior Auto Mode also met my expectations.  It does not improve all photos but it does make astonishing improvements in photos that would benefit from this mode such as back light etc.""
"20120521","5.0","Impressive","I am by no means an expert photographer, nor do I know a lot about cameras. I am a big fan of Sony products but have been disappointed in the past with their digital cameras. This camera, however, is fabulous. I have only played with it a little, but it takes impressive photos.The menu screens are very user friendly. Each setting has a brief explanation. There is also a built in help button. The camera has 2 automatic settings where the camera chooses what is best for the conditions. There are also several other settings to choose from (I am still learning these). I thought it was interesting that you can turn off the automatic focus and you can control the focus.All in all I am very happy with my purchase. I would recommend this camera to anyone.""
"20120520","4.0","A Higher End P&S that thinks its a DSLR","Sony has done it again. They have, and are pioneering consumer Camera products that have other Camera manufactures scrambling to keep up. Here is some insight for the reader about the new Sony DSC-HX200V (released Feb. 28, 2012). I am an amateur hobby enthusiast photographer who primarily takes Wildlife and Landscape photos. Hence I am NOT an expert, but can at least hold a small candle in the photography world. This new DSC-HX200V system is a bit of a hybrid in that it is utilizing Sony's excellent Exmor Sensor, Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar 'T' Lens system, offers an impressive array of MODE usages that are: Automatic, or User-controlled, or a combination of semi-auto & User-controlled functions and settings. With 18.2mp, and 30x Optical and another 30x Digital - you have the capabilities to expect very clear images taken at considerable distances. The host of features and options within this model are too extensive to burden the reader with herein - however in simple terms, this new Camera is a 'bad boy' (very powerful) that provides nearly all the features of an expensive DSLR or SLT Alpha type Camera. It truly is a high end Point & Shoot Camera, and it has an Electronic Viewfinder (similar to Sony's Alpha series SLT Cameras).There are a couple things that prevent me from giving this rating a (5). Sony has discontinued providing its very good and respected Software Program known as 'PMB' (Picture Movie Browser) that has in the past come with its products in the form of an included Disc to load into your computer system. This has now been replaced with Sony's 'PMH' (Photo Memories Home) Software Program in which the Camera itself has built in Firmware (no diskette is included anymore) that will connect you on-line with Sony's Web, and download this new program into your computer system. The downloading will automatically erase any PMB Software with this new PMH product. In my case the erasure of PMB also stopped and took out Microsoft's 'Media Center' program built into Windows 7 (I also use for Slide Shows), and this supposed newer/better software is anything but! The Camera does come with a rather poor 30pg. 'Users Manual', and is also down loadable in PDF Format.Secondly, Sony's 'USERS GUIDE' (some 215pg. detailed camera usage & operation) can only be seen by going to Sony's Web site via your Browser, and is in HTML format only. Meaning that you can not 'download' the Users Guide into your system, NO PDF Formatting, you can only view one topic at a time, but you can print each topics 1-3 pages of HTML sub-section. SONY Support is absolutely terrible. It comes out of the Philippines in which they have little desire or understanding in truly helping you. They all have pre-written scripts of reply, and simply press a key for the script that 'might' come close to your question or concern. This also holds true for their Level II Support, and 'Customer Relations' Department. It is in poor marketing and support that Sony has ceased providing a Diskette that you can load into your PC enabling you to have 'at hand' the necessary detailed operational usage, and functionality of your new purchase. Sony also does not offer a printed hard copy of the Users Guide, or Diskette for purchase either.  This is not the only product Sony sells that excludes user/owner operational product details. Sony has made dramatic cutbacks in many areas - as are so many other companies that are now shaving services, and product package contents - a real shame!This review reflects Cameta Camera (of Long Island, N.Y.) in which I have personally done business with them numerous times. They have outstanding pricing and carry top shelf brands of products. Their Customer Service department leaves much to be desired however - they do so much business that they are quite hard-nosed about things.The Camera product herein - is the follow-on to Sony's family of 'HX Series' products. The HX9V for example came out in 2011 and is a terrific product. The HX 10, 20, 30 have also come out more recently. This HX200V (the 'V' means it has GPS Capabilities to relate to exactly where/when the photograph was actually taken) shares much of the same features and functions as its bigger much more expensive Alpha Series SLT (DSLR type) Cameras. So the bottom line is: Sony has terrific products - truly - but their Support leaves a tremendous void. Sony Cameras are not only equal to, but surpass many of the other very well respected name brands - I know because I utilize DSLR & P&S type products from Canon and Nikon also.I hope this provides some insight to the perspective buyer.""

"20120513","5.0","Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V","I found myself wanting to up grade my super-zoom point and shoot camera. I had a Samsung HZ50W and wasvery happy with it, but I felt it was time for change.I read reviews from everywhere I could, from camera experts to everyday people, I decided on looking at fivecameras, Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V, Fujifilm FinePix HS30EXR, Nikon COOLPIX P510,Panasonic DMC-FZ150K, and Canon SX40 HS.I decided if I was spending $400 to $500 on a camera I was going to try them out in stores first. I like to buy thingsonline, but I don't like returning items, so off to the local shops.  First I'll have to say that I drove about 90 miles to look at cameras. Unfortunately I couldn't find 2 cameras, theFujifilm FinePix HS30EXR or the Panasonic DMC-FZ150K no one carried either one.I played around with the other 3 cameras quite a bit, all were very nice and I don't think I would have gonewrong with any of them. It was little things that made me pick the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V. The Canonhad I smaller screen and auto focus seem to struggle at times, plus 2 different sales people told me if you buya Canon get the extended warranty, although I don't see any issues like that in any reviews. The Nikon was nice butit seemed to miss a good shot more often, whether taking to long to focus or a little blurry.The Sony seemed to focus fast and get the shot way more often and the 3 inch screen was nice.. I have nowowned this camera for a week and can't stop taking pictures and video. I have tried to put this camera in everysituation possible and it has worked every time. So far I've taken pictures at my son's tennis meet, other son'sband concert, portraits, the dogs, flowers, landscape, low light, no light, bright light, very close, full zoom, burst modesand couldn't be happier. The video is great  , I still can't believe how smooth and detailed the video, I took of my sonsband concert, holding the camera by hand no tripod and at half to full zoom.I am an amateur photographer that takes about 100 to 1000 pictures a week and have for 15 to 20 years,we have had more cameras than I can count, including SLR - DSLR, point and shoot, and video cameras.As with every camera there are a few cons, The viewfinder is not very good, but I love that the camera switchesto it automatically when you go to look through it. Also no Raw image, my last camera had it and I was just startingto learn how it use it in editing. 29 minute video length limit? I don't know if that will ever be an issue, but why the limit.And I've never seen this on a point and shoot camera, but why can't we turn off the picture preview and have a liveview all the time, it would be much easier to follow the action whether in burst or single shot mode.I am very happy with this camera, and I can live with the few cons I found, Thanks for reading, hope this helps.""

The camera insists on displaying each photo as you shoot; you can speed things up by pressing the shutter release, but very agrivating when shooting wild life.There is a built in manual, but not real useful.  With all it's great features, you would think that Sony could provide you a manual, at least in PDF format.  No, they set up a web based manual.  You can,t print it (except one page at a time); you can't get to it unless you have web access.  I talked to customer support......they were not much help and did not indicate that a PDF manual would become available.""

It is so much better than the HX100 both in zoom capabilities and overall speed of the camera. I was able to get a remarkably clear photo of the moon close up and without having to crop the image. This is saying something for a point and shoot... Even DSLRs would have difficulty getting such a shot without having at least a 600-800mm lens which is an expensive one  for any camera.  Overall, I am extremely happy with this camera...Bravo, Sony!""
"20120429","5.0","What else could I ask for?","I have been a photographer for 15 years.  I helped my ex wife run her photography business for 5 years, serving as the post processor for 100,000's of Raw files, and was also the second shooter for weddings and celebrity events.  The last 'real' camera that I spent a lot of time with was a Nikon D3, but have also owned a D2X and a 1D MKIII.  My ex wife retained all the good camera gear after our divorce, so I have been running around with a Nikon P7000 for the past 1.5 years.  Why the P7000?  Answer: full external manual controls.  It took decent snap shots when I needed to take pictures of people (or EBay items... lol).  I finally decided to try and photograph my kids baseball games....  and that camera just did not have ANY speed to do that.  I basically had to setthe camera to shutter priority mode at 1/500 and just time the shot right to capture action.... plus the whopping 1.2 fps was just not intended for sports.  TIME TO CAMERA SHOP.  I spent 3 days reading reviews of the latest super zooms on dpreview, cnet, zdnet, photography blog, imaging recource, etc.  It seemed like the Panasonic FZ150 and Sony HX100V, HX200V were the answer (because I also wanted 1080 60P video capability).  NOT ONE FREAKIN BIG BOX RETAILER, CAMERA STORE, OR OFFICE SUPPLY STORE EVEN STOCKED THE PANASONIC FZ150 in San Diego.  Seriously, who is in charge of ordering merchandise for these stores!!!!  So after going to EVERY store, I handled Canon and Nikon cameras in this category, and they just felt cheap and plasticy.  I handled a Panasonic FZ47, and it felt CHEAP, and if the FZ150 feels anything like it, there is no way I would drop $500 on that camera..  I came across a HX200V for $399, bought it.  I bought a 32GB SD card (class 10, 30mb/s) and photographed 2 little league games yesterday.  The 'Tracking Focus' function is just awesome.  Simply press the center control button on the back of of the camera and a little box appears, now place that little box on your subject and press the center control button again......  now a larger 'floating' box stays on your subject no matter where in the frame the subject moves to.  I was using shutter priority at 1/640 and shooting continuous bursts up to 10 frames all day long......  at the 10 fps setting.  This camera is FAST and free of delays, except when the camera needs to dump 10 full resolution images onto the memory card...  seemed to take about 3-4 seconds.  I filmed each of my son's batting sequences, twice each at 1080 60p.....  watched the video on my new Acer A510 tablet computer, and the video was well focused and smooth.  It's so funny, I don't think any of my action sequences were out of focus.  I have not had time to test all the other aspects of this camera, but so far, so good.  The build quality feels robust in my hands.  However, when the lense is fully retracted, if you shake the camera a little, you can feel play/movement of the lenses barrel inside the body.  I researched this, and the HX100V and a few other makes exhibit the same thing.  They are designed this way so that the seals are not too tight for the lense to zoom in and out smoothly, without resistance.  Once you zoom a bit toward the telephoto end, that play/movement tightens up and completely goes away.  Also, the up and down tilting real screen helped big time while holding the camera over my head to take pics over the fence.  Also, a big plus for me....  just leave the huge charging block/cable in the box....... this camera will also charge through the USB port with the other supplied cable, I charged it in my car by plugging in the USB cable into my cigarette lighter adapter iPod charger piece.  Someone in another review claimed that it does not come with a lense cap...... well it most certainly DOES.""
"20120422","5.0","A+ For what it is","This replaced my H5, and it is so much better, The H5 had the Zoom control in the wrong spot, Just holding the camera it would go to full zoom, a pain. This camera is much better, The manual options are very nice and the user interface is great, so glad they did not go with a touch screen, my fingers are too fat, I much prefer the buttons. The pictures are very very good IMO.The 1080P 60 frame video is also very very good.IMO The best bang for the buck.The Nikon 510 was nice but felt cheaper and smaller.Very happy with my purchase""
"20120415","5.0","Could have had one more star.","You know, this HX series can trace itself back to the high end Minolta P&S cams like the A1(5mp) and A2(8mp) from 2004/5.  With that in mind, there are three things about the HX200V that would make this 6 stars, were they included.  Threads for filters, dedicated remote port and the ability to sync with an external flash, all of which were on the A1 and A2.  Those things would help make this more of a photographer's cam.  Plus, it was having bought the filters, remote and external flash for the A1 that helped me decide to get the Sony A200.  Still, I bought this for the features it does have like the ability to switch control of the zoom & focus from the lens to the body and the full manual mode.  Some say the boost to 18mp doesn't help and makes the pictures fuzzy, but the HX200 has many resolutions to choose from.  If you've been shooting at 10mp or less before now, I think you'll see that what we assumed was 'sharpness' was a lack of detail.  Kind of like making the jump from VGA to even just 2mp.Newer pics on older displays don't quite match up.  As far as picture quality, I noticed the HX200 likes contrast. I'm impressed with what it can do with HDR in B&W.  I like that there are links to the more obscure functions in the in-camera guide.  Other than that, I like the feel, features and price-for-features.  The scene modes and effects are nice and fun to have, but the aforementioned additions would, on the whole, be more useful. And, Sony might sell more aftermarket stuff.Now, if we could only get these manufacturers to support their products beyond the first year....""
"20120414","1.0","If you ever used SLR stay away from this camera","I needed point and shoot camera to carry along all the time for screen size / e-mails. I had many different Nikon semi-pro SLRs film and digital so I new what to expect from $500 camera. I also bought Panasonic Panasonic DMC-FZ150K for comparizon.Here are the most annoying features of Sony HX200V that make this camera unusable IMHO:1. no filter thread2. no lens hood3. takes forever between pictures (several seconds)4. easy to screw up setting so it starts editing in camera instead of taking normal pictures5. 18 MP is really does not produce expected quality, even on my monitor I do not see a sharp picture, that I would expect even from good 6 MP camera.6. lack of external controls to setup quickly for shootingIn contrast, Panasonic DMC-FZ150K for people familiar with SLRs is intuitive and easy to use and produces expected results. I returned Sony and kept Panasonic.Sony should really rethink their camera features. It's a shame to produce this brain dead design when company has incredible expertize in every camera component. This kind of products create a very bad impression about the company.""
"20120412","1.0","Must have gotten a defective one?","I really wanted to love this camera: superzoom, choice of electric or manual zoom, comfortable form, many nice other features.Unfortunately, only a few of my 80 test shots were in sharp focus. The rest were soft and fuzzy, even though the camera thought it had locked focus (solid green light and focus brackets). I tested all focal lengths from macro to fully extended zoom, in bright cloudy outdoor light and bright indoor natural light. Same results throughout: mushy focus that couldn't be seen until the photos were uploaded.There were two symptoms of malfunction as I was shooting. First, the camera shake warning flashed for every single shot. This is not reasonable: my hands are normally steady, and although at full zoom one might expect that a tripod would be necessary, it shouldn't be needed for macro or moderate focal lengths. Clearly the internal optical stabilization of the camera was malfunctioning. Second, the manual focus function of the zoom/focus ring didn't work at all. The ring would zoom when set to zoom/autofocus, but it simply would not focus when set to do so.One more thing to be concerned about with this camera: it does not accept a filter or lens hood. In other words, there's no way to protect its precious lens from scratches, impact, or rain. I confirmed this with Sony.Finally, the low-resolution viewfinder of this camera offers barely adequate clarity for framing and focusing pictures.I've sent the camera back for a refund, and I'm disappointed.""
"20120412","5.0","Truly amazing camera.","First, Beach camera is great. The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX200V arrived swiftly and ahead of schedule. The camera arrived in mint condition. The bundle for $499.00 including the 16 GB memory card, case, card reader, tripod, etc is an incredible deal.  The Sony DSC-HX200V camera is amazing! I know virtually nothing about advanced photography, but learning this camera's functions is fairly easy.  The zoom on it is wonderful, and it focuses quickly. While I am still learning how to operate all of it's functions, I'm thrilled with it's performance so far.  The only thing I've had a problem with is transfering videos to my computer, and I'm sure that's a result of something I've done wrong. For some reason when I import pictures & video's, only the pictures transfer to the computer? I've tried using a card reader & direct hookup to computer, and still am only getting the photos and not videos.""
"20120412","5.0","Absolutely amazing","I am moving from Canon g12, (I am a strong believer in bridge compact cameras with SLR features and no lences to carry) and this camera is just incomparable with whatever I owned before or the SLRs my husband owns. Light weight, small in size, stunning pictures, zoom-unreal-everything you need for professional looking pictures hassle free. Love it!""
"20120408","5.0","Great Camera","I am an amatuer photographer and this is the best point and shoot camera I have ever owned. The 30X zoom has given me great shots of birds, scenery and I have great pictures of a full moon, showing incredible detail of craters.  I am still learning the special features available with this camera and I will offer more information in the coming months.  I have been using a Sony DSC-H7 with a 15X zoom and 8 megapixels for the past four years and love the pictures that I have gotten from it.  The DSC HX200V is a major step up.""
"20120402","5.0","Awesome camera for the money","I got this camera to upgrade from my very little point and shoot. I felt like I wanted to get a bit more professional with my pictures but did not want the big carrying package that is associated with typical SLR cameras with the extra lenses and battery packs. I like that I can carry the camera in an average camera bag and take it with me wherever I go because I like to have my camera with me all the time for the kids activities and wildlife I may run into.The zoom is more than adequate, in fact the zoom on this camera outdid a typical SLR camera on a recent photo shoot. The digital zoom has a stability feature so the pictures are crystal clear without the use of a tripod. I took photo's of the night moon and the zoom was so incredible using the low light feature that the mountains on the moon are clearly visible. Very impressive! The 18mp quality allows for crop and blow up to be even more amazing.I like the panaramic feature and the continuous shot mode, just by holding the button you get your consecutive pictures.I am only just learning all the features this camera has to offer but the camera has performed beyond what I expected so far. I am so pleased with the product and my friends with the typical SLR's are ready to 'downgrade' to this one. They were impressed by it's features and quality. Definitley would tell you to purchase this camera! Love it!""
"20120331","5.0","Amazing Upgrade from a Point and Shoot!","Let me start off by saying I'm not avid photographer and am accustomed to typical compact point and shoots and the latest iPhone camera.  We purchased this camera to capture action shots for our son's games and for better overall picture taking of family vacations.  We were contemplating stepping up to a DSLR however the added bulk and the learning curve were a detractor.  Thus I decided on a bridge cameraI spent hours reading reviews between this preorder, the HX100V, Panasonic FZ150 and Canon's SX40.  I chose this because of the HX100V reviews and knowing this would be an improved model along with a much better price found on buydig which also included a 16gb class 10 sony card and a generic case.I received it last night and we took some sample photos and videos in low light conditions and were very impressed!  It captured fine details such as shadows around a face and the photos simply looked 10x better than anything we've ever captured.  It's a true night and day difference.The learning curve on the camera doesn't seem to be all that terrible.  Most functions were easy to figure out.  There's also a built in manual in the camera which is useful.  The paper manual is very basic.  There are also a ton of youtube videos on the HX100v that prove useful in learning some of the advanced features.Regarding some of the other comments, yes the camera charger is huge.  It's similar to that of a laptop power cord brick.  However, the manual states you can charge the camera from the provided PC USB cord.  The camera takes a micro usb end.  This means it'll work with phone chargers!  You can even use your iPhone's charger.  Just plug in the Sony USB cord to the iphone charger and the other end to the camera.  Note: It may take longer to charge via this method, but is much more convenient.""
"20120329","5.0","Brief Review","Most likely you have already read professional reviews of this item, so I will not repeat the list of features. Here are bits of info that I didn't find in reviews when I was shopping, and had hoped someone would post, along with a few surprises I found:1- Once you turn off the annoying start up tone, it takes less than a second to be ready, a big plus2- There is a zoom/focus ring. It is electronic, I would have preferred a mechanical one but it works well. Zoom or focus selectable by a switch3- The sweep panorama mode works well with the exception of the fact that it has a fixed width. If you don't sweep far enough within the allotted time, e.g. because you don't want too wide a panorama, the rest of the image will be filled with a grey filler. I hope a firmware update will fix this as it looks hideous.4- Macro photos are not the greatest.5- Ability to select the mode automatically works well.6- When powered on, the extending lens struggles if lens cover is still on. Would have been nice if it were removed automatically (too spoiled, I know)7- The included charger is an in-camera charger. It can power the camera for use and also while connected to a PC. To charge an extra battery, you'll need to buy a separate standalone charger. While connected to a PC, the camera charges the battery through the USB port.8- Great camera. Amazon and Beach Camera are outstanding.9- The bundle from Beach Camera is great (Make sure to get the one with the 16GB card)I like the camera and will definitely keep it for years to come.""
"20120328","4.0","Sony superzoom","Wanted a superzoom with Panorama mode so the choices are fairly limited.  This week both the Sony HX200V and Nikon P510 came out so bought them both to compare.  The first review by 'techguy' gives some nice details about the camera so I won't repeat his comments.  I've played with them now for a couple of days and do not claim to be an expert by any means so take these comments with a grain of salt.  These are just initial impressions.I found overall the Sony took nicer pictures than the Nikon which tended to give a slight yellow hue on grass.  And when enlarging the pictures the detail was better.  The Sony produced slightly clearer pics both indoors and out and skins tones were a little warmer and more natural.  The Sony also allows you to adjust the color and vividness to personal taste, don't believe the Nikon allowed for this.I did like the size and feel of the Nikon better, the menu was a little more user friendly I thought and so was the layout of buttons.  Start up time was about equal, although be aware with the Nikon if you choose to have it display the 'Coolpix' icon it delays this by a couple of seconds.One feature I found very useful is the Sony tells you how much time remains in minutes, not just a bar graph, I hate running out of power unexpectedly.  Biggest gripe so far with the Sony is the power cord/charger. It's nearly as big as my laptop charger.  Wish they would do it like Nikon or Panasonic.  I travel on a motorcycle and space is very limited so this is a pain.Sony puts the Panorama mode on the top dial while Nikon buries it with the Scene mode and the view finder turns on automatically if you put your eye to it, both thoughtful touches.  I really wanted to like the Nikon more, mainly due to the better charger layout but in the end, good pictures is what it all about so the Nikon will be going back.""
"20120324","5.0","Excellent","For some reason this was available in New Zealand, via Asia, before the US/UK release.  I've had it for about a week now.  So, it is as spec'ed in the preview comments about it so far from the various websites.It starts fast, focuses quickly, does not have shutter lag and is easy to handle and has tons of functions.  It handles well for its size and does not feel heavy. Having the zoom on the side of the lens is great - makes it more stable to hold the camera. I've taken some pretty amazing shots with it - the zoom allows good creativity and the low light capability produces detailed and pleasing shots.  How much different this camera is to the previous model I'm not really sure in terms of the additional megapixels via the new sensor. My previous camera was a Olympus E620 DSLR - in comparison there is less detail with the Sony, although not hugely noticeable on a 23' LCD computer monitor. The camera is a lot of fun to use and it just begs you to be more creative when shooting. The partial colour shots are great. The LCD screen is very good, nice and bright. Nice touch to use the optical viewfinder and have the screen turn off. The built in user manual is great - to look up what a function does without having to refer to the manual.  Also when you find what you want it provides the option to go to that function right away - so for example I wanted to look at the ND filter function, once I've read what it does I can then select to open the function from the help screen rather than exiting help and then trying to find it through the menu system.It provides good flash coverage and the slow-sync function is great to prevent those deer in the headlights shots - as this flash can put out a lot of light.The superior auto mode is good for the stability/less blur in long range shots as it takes multiple photos and apparently works out which is the best photo to save.  This is great as at maximum zoom the camera shake from your hands can be a problem if you've ever experienced using a megazoom before. Personally without that image stabilisation and multi-shot taking having a megazoom is a bit pointless as you'd never take good photos at long range without frustration.Shooting movies and the ability to shoot a good sized still at the same time is very impressive - probably one of the best features - as I've always wanted to be able to take a high MP shot during a video shoot because that's when you typically need it and on other cameras it was always one or the other but not both at the same time. The video quality is very good. No issues there and the zoom works well when videoing.  The microphone does pick up background noise around the camera (ie from people talking nearby) and without a zoom mic option is somewhat limiting. That said the audio capture is good.Other good things - HDR - similar function to my iPhone 4S - produces good highlighting without overcooking the photo. When it is taking multiple photos with HDR and other functions it takes a few seconds time to process and save these but I guess thats normal. The menu system is good - particularly given how many functions this camera has.I use it with a Sandisk 32GB Extreme 32GB SDHC Flash Memory Card (Class 10).  Seems fine to use - saves quickly. It is probably better to get higher spec cards like this one if shooting HD video.On the downside... the lens cap can get stuck if you don't remove it before turning the power on. Flash - there's no button to pop it up as per usual cameras - you need to use the jog dial and select flash to get it to pop-up. Once set it then pops up the flash when needed. The LCD screen doesn't fully articulate but that is not a major for me.In summary it will never please the pro's out there - the image quality is very good but not perfect.  Good enough for most people wanting the 'best for me' rather than 'best in the world' class of camera - its affordable, has huge capabilities, more than acceptable image quality and fun. A family orientated camera for sure that everyone can pick up and use and get pleasing results (and compliments).There is a link to a few photos in the comments section (all handheld shots, no photo editing).  Have added some more photos - very pleased with the colour accuracy.A bit more on zooming in photo or video mode and focusing speed which is typically an issue with superzooms.  To me the Sony seems quick to focus at maximum zoom in photo or video mode.  We're certainly not talking more than a half a second to a second say from one subject to another at the far end of the zoom.  It's quick and smooth with no hunting zoom noises. Would be nice if someone else reviewed this camera to concur!""
