"20120612","5.0","Canon PowerShot SX260","We took this camera on vacation with one of my other slightly bulkier cameras. We ended up using this one all the time. The battery life was pretty decent. We were able to go a whole day without failure and usually with our other camera we have to charge it once or twice a day. The charge on the battery also took minimal time. That was nice as well. We bought extra and very rarely had to use it. It took some incredible shots and the zoom was a great feature. It was so nice to slide it into a pocket on the shorts and not have to carry around a bulky camera. We did not really use the video on it, but I'm sure we will eventually. We were quite pleased with this and it has become our new camera of choice for the go everywhere camera. The only thing is in the description, its not red, its pink. I didn't mind. Fortunately my husband doesn't have an identify crisis.  :)""
"20120611","5.0","Dig and reap the rewards.","I have been using this camera now for a while. I come from the SLR film days and needed something that would provide full manual (just enough) controls that would allow me to tweak settings if I wished.  This camera is a 90% fit for me in this regard.  No use having all of the bells and whistles and not be able to grab it and carry it along and end up missing the shot.  There are compromises, notably some quality, for the convenience.  If all you end up printing on is letter sized photo paper, you'll be fine.  I use a Canon Pixma 980 and the results are as good as my SLR stuff from 25 years ago, all instantly, compared to those days.  Take the time and go through the manual (it's a pity that it only comes in pdf format) it is really worth it.  That being said, it's a lot to digest in one go, so give yourself some time to work through the features (and there are many).  Seems that each setting has some gems buried in sub-layers of settings.  Unless you clearly understand the basics and what the terms mean, it can get quite intimidating.  The auto modes do work well though, and if you understand the impact of high ISO, various shutter speeds and aperture values, you can always tweak things yourself.  The bottom line is that it does a fine job of both auto and manual shots.  The wide to superzoom is really great, and combined with some really good low/natural light capabilities, this camera is lots of fun.  The most confusing thing for me when I first held it was 'where do I hold it?' It's so small, that I really do not know where to place my fingers at times, but the metal feel is sturdy.  The flash can be a bit annoying sometimes, but I've worked that out by mainly shooting in 'auto' and setting 'no flash' until I do really need it.  The GPS feature is handy, but I would not use it unless travelling around.  Get lots of spare batteries, you'll need them, as battery life is not too good.  Also get a good case, as the lens can be easily damaged.  There is lots more that I can say about this camera, nearly all good; but I'll leave it here for now.  P.S. Do not be afraid of the digital zoom, this one can actually get a really far off shot if necessary, and the blur is understandable, but tolerable.""
"20120610","5.0","Absolutely wonderful","I was a little skeptical about making a large purchase. But I've had Canon before I knew I wanted it again. They have NEVER left me down. I've had two cameras prior to this most recent purchase: one a Canon, which I lost, and a Sony Powershot. As soon as I bought the Powershot, I said to myself I should've bought another Canon.I just took it with me on a road trip to South Carolina with my girlfriend and the picture we (really she) took came out magnificent. I told her that it was a green camera. She gave me crap for it because I guess to her it's not a real green;  (it's still green to me). BUT that was her only complaint.I'm a big fan of my new 'toys' having stuff. There are so many options on the camera, not one picture has to be the same if you don't want it to be. Definitely a worthwhile purchase. Totally would recommend it!""
"20120609","5.0","Great camera","I took this camera to a concert and I have great pictures! Such clear photos! The time it takes to pause after taking a picture is a little annoying, but nothing to return the camera over. The zoom was great. The different settings for pictures are fun. It's a super easy to use camera.Also, the 'red' model is definitely hot pink, just like the picture. Fair warning.You might need a bigger memory card for this though. I just kept my old 2GB disk and it was full very quickly, something that never happened with my older cameras.""
"20120607","5.0","Powershot S95/100 versus SX260","We just returned from a trip overseas and brought both the S95 and the SX260. We have owned the S95 for the past 2 years and really liked the camera but we wanted to get another camera as a backup and also to get one with a higher optical zoom. We tested both cameras in multiple situations on the trip and came to the conclusion that the S95 takes better night shots but the SX260 takes better shots in the day and the 20X optical zoom is extremely useful. The S95 allows you to go full manual but the SX260 gives you many options to play with your photo taking. Overall, if I could only take one camera I would take the SX260 because the optical zoom and picture quality is great. The night photos were pretty good too but not as good as the S95 (obviously if you are planning on taking more night shots, then the S95/100 would probably be better for you). On a side note, the GPS on the SX260 sucks battery life very quickly and the camera has a difficult time finding the GPS signal (we left it off for most of the trip)""
"20120607","4.0","Personal Camera","I recently purchased this camera wanting a small personal one for my purse...replacing my other Canon that flipped out of my pocket and into the toilet!! :(  I bought this one for it's red color and powerful zoom of 20x.  However, the color is more of a hot pink and it is heavier than I wanted. It also has a stiff wrist strap that I don't care for.  I thought it was around my wrist when I took a pix at the fair but what I felt was instead, my just-purchased ride bracelet so when I finished taking a pix, I dropped it onto the asphalt!!  It damaged a corner of the view finder and now I have a big black spot covering what I am taking on my finder.  It however does not affect the pixs taken.  I sent it back to Canon to be repaired when the tech said it would be about $100.  When the estimate came in, it was about $239 plus shipping and handling. (250.00!!) In no way would I pay for this camera almost twice!  So be careful!  It does take great pixs in the 17 days I had it :(""
"20120607","1.0","WARNING: High Pitch Noise on Video SX260","All the reports of a high pitch noise been recorded on video mode are true. I bought this camera at Best_Buy and it had the same issue, this problem is extremely widespread and if you see the camera been sold at a discount is probably because the store knows they have a problem and are dumping them on uninformed buyers. Do not underestimate this noise, it will ruin your wedding video for sure or any video shot in a semi-quiet environment.  Shame on Canon for not issuing a recall. Sadly there is no way to test the cameras been sold on internet stores and they are not easy to return.Also the battery life on this camera is dismal even if you are not using the GPS function or autofocus mode, if you turn the GPS you will be lucky if you get 200 pictures with one charge. Another annoying quirk is that this camera does not create automatic Panoramic photographs, it simply does not stitch them together, that is just plain dumb.UPDATE: I exchanged the defective Canon SX260 for the same model, the new camera produces no high pitch noise but the Canon SX260 still introduces an unusually loud white noise, sounds like a 'waterfall' on the background, it is always there, even when there is music or dialogue. It never goes away. Compared to my Sony Cybershot, the Canon SX260 background noise is easily twice as loud what it should be. Because of this, I still cannot recommend this camera for shooting in quiet environments. In my humble opinion the microphone automatic 'gain' is set too loud compared to other digital cameras.Walllmart has taken all their Canon SX260 off the shelves around here, I wonder why. BB is still selling them and may be re-selling the defective ones that everyone has returned including mine, Canon does not allow them to resale open-box so they may very well put them back on the shelf with no warning. I cannot speak for Amazon, their cameras could be fine but others here will have to testify to that.""

"20120606","2.0","Don't Depend on the GPS","The camera seems OK, for the most part, if all you want is an expensive point-and-shoot camera. However, the main purpose for which I purchased this camera was to have geo-tagged images from GPS.The GPS receiver on the SX260 HS is so weak or whimpy that it surely doesn't pick up a signal indoors, and even outdoors it often fails. On the other hand, I have multiple iPhones and they get a strong GPS signal anywhere and everywhere, even in the basement.I called Canon (800-652-2666) and they played dumb. I asked for a Level 2 or Level 3 technician. They said they have none. The tech (Richard) that I did speak with said anything could cause interference... 'Even if you are standing near a tree, it can block the signal.' Where I live in rural Wisconsin, when aren't I near a tree?If you want geo-tagging from GPS, don't count on the PowerShot SX260 HS. The GPS receiver is a toy.""
"20120604","5.0","Excellent Camera.","I'm very happy with this camera. Its a bit bigger than my old SD1100 but still a compact size.

Other than that i'm really happy with this item.""
"20120602","5.0","Happy I bouught this camera","I was in the market for a point and shoot camera to take on my recent trip to Florida. I didn't want to carry my big SLR camera around Disney World as I have done in the past. After researching and reading reviews I decided on the Canon Powershot SX260 HS. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The camera is easy to use and takes great pictures. My seven year old granddaughter was even able to use the camera with ease. I can't say enough about the 20X zoom..........FANTASTIC! I love the different shooting modes. I was able to get great fireworks shots at Disney. The color and clarity of my printed pictures far exceeded my expectations. The only downside for me is this camera didn't come with a complete printed manual. It only comes with the getting started booklet. This camera has so many great features that I want to make use of all of them. I downloaded the manual CD and printed a copy. I find that easier than logging on to the computer when I want to read up on a particluar feature. All in all this is a great camera.""
"20120602","5.0","Excellent zoom for pocket cameras","Very pleased with our new Power Shot SX260.  We have a SLR digital and a Canon S90 that we love, but wanted a pocket camera with a good zoom for longer trips.  This little camera is amazing.  We tested it on our boat in moderate choppy water on Charlotte Bay, FL and were pleasantly surprised with the resolution at full zoom.  We shot some photos of a guy fishing about 75 - 100 yards away and the detail and clarity were excellent.  For our next trip out of the country we will probably leave the SLR at home (for the first time) and use this along with our S90.  I do miss having the 'Beach' and other options that the S90 has, but the long zoom on the SX260 is a wonderful feature.  This will probably become our primary camera.""
"20120602","3.0","Compared this to the Lumix ZS19 and it came short","I want to preface that I am not a professional or very dedicated photographer. My review is for people like me: love photography, use mostly scene settings, some manual tinkering (aperture and shutter speed priority) and love to take scenery and wildlife pictures. I am in the market for a smaller camera to take to my hikes/travel etc. to replace my Lumix FZ28 which was stolen on my recent trip to Costa Rica. I already have a Nikon D5100 which I love and takes great pics, but it was just to heavy and bulky to take it along. I purchased both a Canon SX260HS and a Lumix ZS19 to try out because both their specifications seem comparable and I trust both brands. I took pics side by side with these two cameras, and here are my observations:1. color: panasonic colors were generally cooler with more green/blue vs. the canon's warmer colors (yellowish tones) for the same scenes and lighting2. the HDR features of the Lumix are amazing for high contrast/bright background.3. the zoomed pictures for the Lumix were clearer (less blurry) than the Canon's (I took pictures of a power tower and some distant hills in the late afternoon light)4. the most important consideration for me was the ability to focus. I took pictures of flowers and foliage and the Lumix clearly outshone with the feature of the touch screen (I could tell it to focus on a particular petal or detail just by touching the image on the screen) whereas I ended up with a lot of out of focus pictures with the Canon.Note that I did not try the GPS feature of the Canon since it is not that important to me.In conclusion, even the expert reviews talk about a better image quality of the Canon SX260, I decided that for my purposes, I prefer the images that the Lumix ZS19.I am going to return both cameras today and order the Lumix ZS20 instead (because of the promotion, the price of the ZS20 is the same as what I paid for the ZS19, so the GPS feature is for free!!!)""
"20120601","4.0","Very Happy!","Okay... so other than the flash popping up and hitting my finger for the first 20 times until I finally memorized not to put my finger on top of the flash, I love this camera.  So the flash position on the camera sucks... and the time between each picture shot is really annoyingly long, but other than that, I really like this camera.  Love the long zoom, and love having a zoom while in video mode (although hearing the zoom function during video playback is pretty lame!).  It shoots amazingly well in low-light, as well as with all other situations (so far).""

At times it produces great photos but it has issues with autofocus, and when recording you can hear what sounds like a fan noise. i was recording moments from my cousin's wedding and you can hear the fan noise over the voices. Its quite frustrating. I love it when it works but when it misses moments due to focusing thats horrible.""
"20120530","5.0","This camera reads your mind!","I would characterize myself as a mid-level amateur photographer - I'm picky about good image quality and not satisfied with cell phone pictures or a basic point and shoot. On the other hand, I don't want to carry a lot of bulky equipment and I don't know enough about photography to mess with things like aperture settings. Between 2005 and 2009 I went through four or five digital cameras as the technology evolved trying to find one that fit my needs. In May of 2009, I got the first camera in this series, the SX 200, and felt that I finally had the camera for me. It just takes fabulous pictures, is so easy to use, and easy to carry around. It has 12 X optical zoom, which was unbeatable in a compact point and shoot at that time.I've kept my eye on the newer models coming out and haven't been tempted to upgrade until I saw that the SX 260 had a 20 X optical zoom. I was concerned that some of the modes I used regularly on the SX 200 (indoor lighting, landscape) didn't seem to exist anymore, and another mode that I used frequently (portrait) still existed but wasn't accessible through the dial, you have to go through the menu.After a few days of trying this camera, I am just blown away by the image quality. I experimented with different scene modes, but there's really very little need to use anything but auto. The camera just figures out what you want to do. I've gotten a number of incredibly beautiful flower pictures without ever leaving auto mode. If you want macro, you just zoom in on what you want and there it is. If you want pictures of people, it figures that out and adjusts accordingly. The 20 X zoom is phenomenal and, as others have stated, the image stabilization is flawless. I can take pictures one-handed while holding my two dogs' leashes in the other hand as they pull and tug to keep walking, and there's no blur or lack of focus whatsoever in the pictures (I will say this was also true of the SX 200).I've uploaded a couple of images if you want to look at them.Regarding video, I'm of the school that if you want video, use a video camera. I do have a video camera, but I don't use it very often. Generally I prefer still photographs. So, I would use the video in limited situations where something came up that I wanted to capture and I didn't have my video camera with me. I did a little testing of the video and did not hear the whirring and clicking that others reported. The video quality is very good. I did notice that the playback was atrocious using VLC media player - there was a very loud hiss and the images would pixelate and freeze during playback. However, when using Windows media player for playback, the hiss was only slightly audible and significantly reduced, and the video playback was flawless. For the limited occasions that I expect to use the camera for video, it's perfectly adequate for my needs.I've been so happy with the Canon SX 200 that I really hesitated a lot before purchasing the upgrade. Finally I decided to give it a try, knowing that Amazon would take it back if I wasn't happy with it. I'm so happy that I did - I'm extremely pleased with this camera.Oh, I got red, not black, and it's a little more pinkish than I would like, a darker red wold be nicer :) But who cares, a fun color is nice but what really counts is how it performs.""
"20120528","4.0","Lots of out of focus pictures","So far, I am not happy with this camera. The pictures in Auto and P more are not in focus. When looking at the image it is in focus, but then when you press the shutter button half way, the image goes out of focus. I will be calling Canon to complain to see if it is a defective camera.  Anyone else have this issue?5/29 update - Photos from the Memorial Day parade were mostly out of focus using auto mode.  The only way to get clear pictures was to use the manual focus and set the distance to infinity.  Called Canon today.  Rep had me reset the camera.  Still having the same issues.  I will be talking to a friend that recommended the camera to me to see if his has had similar problems.  At this point, I am suspecting I have a defective camera as most of the other reviews are positive.  I will update as I find out more.6/4 update - Decided to return the camera to amazon as defective. I received the replacement on 6/1. The new camera is functioning significantly better.  So, I must have had a defective camera. We took numerous pictures over the weekend including action shots.

"20120521","5.0","Lots of features for the enthusiastic amateur","This is the latest in a long line of Canon compact digital cameras. it is distinguished by having a wide range of controls. Although it has a very simple point-and-shoot mode it is really targeted at the more enthusiastic amateur anxious to explore other possibilities. It includes several 'fun' options, such as being able to take BW photos with only a single color highlighted, and artificially distorted fish-eye photos, but it also includes many more serious creative options including four variants on different levels of manual control (including manual everything).Pros: Extra long optical zoom and wide angle (25mm-500mm (35 mm equivalent)). The Digic V processor is very powerful and the controls are fairly easy to understand, compared to the competition. The control system is supported by written help instructions as they are selected. Start-up time and shot to shot time is good. Focus time is pretty good. Bump on front makes it easier to hold.Cons: your finger blocks the pop-up flash and this requires a camera re-start. (learn to hold camera differently). The manual includes hundreds of pages telling you how to activate each mode but none on why you want those modes or what they are good for. Buy a separate book if you don't already know.""
"20120518","5.0","Incredible camera and lens","I have now taken well over 200 photos and shot several hours of video with my new SX 260 HS and the one word that summarizes my feelings about this camera is incredible. The zoom is absolutely amazing whether you are shooting still pictures or video.  I have NOT experienced high pitched sound some users are hearing during video playback, either on my computer straight from the SD card or via my TV using an HDMI cable.  That was a huge relief since that apparently is a deal-breaker for many users but the sound on my video is excellent.Last night I shot an entire tennis match by attaching the camera to a small tripod then tying the tripod to the fence and just letting it run for a couple of hours and the detail it captured was incredible.  You could easily pick up the ball movement even on fast rallies.  Even though the camera was probably 20 feet from the closest player you could also pickup quite a bit of dialog.  I then set up the tripod on the court and shot slow motion video of myself serving which was eye-opening to say the least.  This is a pretty unique and useful feature for breaking down and analyzing sports activities and was one of the key reasons I focused on this camera in the first place.I also really like the quick single button video record and stop button on the back of the camera which makes it much easier to capture impromptu scenes.  The low light performance is probably not as good as a DSLR (I don't own one so I don't know for certain) but it seems quite good to me and certainly better than any previous digital camera I have ever owned including my Panasonic FZ-20 I've owned since 2006.  I used to be wowed by my FZ-20's 12x zoom lens which was awesome for outdoor photography but this 20x beast is even better and this camera is about 1/4th the size of the FZ-20.There are so many different shooting modes and options I am still learning them all but the included CD with a User's Guide is very comprehensive so I'm confident I'll eventually learn what I need to know to get the most out of the camera.  The start up time seems very responsive and about the same or quicker than my older Canon A700 or my wife's Canon newer SD1200. To sum up, I am extremely happy with all aspects of this camera and would buy it again in a heartbeat, even if the price were higher than what I paid.""
"20120518","4.0","Finally upgraded from the Canon A1000 and am very happy.","First impressions of picture and video quality are great. My old camera wouldn't take a good picture in our house at night even with all the lights on because everything looked so grainy. This thing took fast pictures and quality was crystal clear in low light even when I zoomed in later looking back through my pictures I was super happy with the clairity. Shot some video of my 6 year old jumping around and it looked great, then I tried the slow motion options and was impressed. If you go too slow it is not that impressive, but the regular slow motion was fun to watch. Haven't even got that far with the setting because the auto mode has worked so well.The only Con I have so far is the placement of the flash. It is right where you would normally hold the camera with your left hand, but you will get used to it and it is not any kind of deal breaker.""
"20120517","2.0","Pictures way too bright & awful action shots","I owned a Canon Powershot SX230 hs and the SX260 was given to me from Canon as a replacement for the SX230 when I began experiencing problems with that camera and sent it in to factory service, in which not all concerns were resolved.  Although I only had the SX230 for a couple of months and the SX260 is supposed to be an upgraded version of that camera, I preferred the SX230.  The pictures taken with the SX260 are extremely bright and untrue in color, even with the lcd display turned down to the lowest setting.  There are supposed to be over 50 settings for the camera to choose from in AUTO mode; however, I've only seen a few of the icons displaying which setting the camera is using, and each time, it's been incorrect for the scene.  I have two girls, ages 3 & 5.  I was told by a Canon Rep that this camera would take excellent action shots of the kids.  I have yet to get one.  The pictures turn out completely distorted and blurry if there is any movement.  The camera has also not detected that I'm trying to take a picture of children (as that is one of the icons, as is a child in motion).  Basically, I am now stuck with a camera that I absolutely hate.  I used to take daily pictures of my kids and now I take only a couple every couple of weeks.  I have tried using different settings and although some do turn out well, it's going to be very difficult for anyone else to pick up this camera and use it, so pictures of me with my kids are out.  I am extremely disappointed and just want the SX230 back, but it was discontinued.  I actually had Canon send me a second SX260 since I felt mine was defective, but I got the same results with that one.  We're getting ready to go on our first family vacation to visit relatives, go to Disney, and to the beach.  I am worried about getting any good shots.  I must also note that the Kids & Pets, and Beach settings are not included on this camera.""
"20120516","5.0","Super Camera","I love this camera!  This is my transition from film to digital camera and I began right off the bat taking professional-looking pictures.  I like the fact that it has controls on the camera body and not everything is hidden where you have to push a 'mode' button for anything to pop-up on the screen.  I was able to operate it without help in the store (not having EVER used a digital camera).  I think that says a lot about Canon.  I've taken some great garden photos so I would especially recommend the camera for people wanting to get fantastic flower close-ups.  It is one of the pricier point and shoot cameras but I feel I made a good investment.  The set-up on the computer was easy and I am not a computer person.  Canon support has been so fast in responding to some routine questions I had about traveling with the camera.""

I'm not sure how or what to do with all the manual settings yet, but it has plenty. Being a mom of three young ones, I appreciate it's compactness and I love that I don't have to carry around a clunky DSLR or SLR-like point-and-shoot to get worthwhile photos! I previously owned a less powerful Canon Powershot, the SD 1100 IS Digital Elph, and the lens is going out after 3.5 years, but that could be due to dropping and dirt in the lens.

"20120511","5.0","Very good point and shoot","As many other reviewers, even folks who typically prefer SLRs, have said, sometimes it's just more convenient and spontaneous to use a point and shoot than a full-blown SLR. You just pull it out of your pocket or bag and go. I bought this camera to replace a Canon PowerShot SX210 IS which I bought a couple of years ago and was never really happy with. It took fairly good pictures, but somehow was not that fun to use. The SX 260 was the perfect replacement. It's basically an update of the older model, but in my opinion, is a vast improvement. The pictures look much better to me, and I rarely use anything but the Auto modes and presets. The combination of 20x zoom and great image stabilization get fantastic shots. We were recently in New Orleans for JazzFest and took a lot of pictures far from the stage, zoomed in to a single performer and I was shocked by how good the images were. It was daylight, so take that into consideration. It also is very quick to be ready to take multiple shots without waiting a long time. The wide angle shots also look better to me, as the SX210 seem to blur those shots considerably at the edges. I mostly use presets for certain conditions, like low-light shots, as opposed to effects, but they all seem to work well if you're into that. The video looks ok, but we don't shoot much. My wife and I typically take hundreds of pictures when we go on trips and have been since the days of film. We never bothered with a film SLR either, but when we look at shots from the film point and shoot days, there is no comparison. Digital wins hands-down, especially on this camera. Often many of the shots we take are multiples of the same scene to make sure we get at least one good one. (We sure didn't do THAT in the film days!) With this camera, we usually have more than one good one from a single series and it's even harder to decide on a keeper. If you are looking for a great quality replacement or improvement from your current digital point and shoot, or an alternative to your SLR, this camera deserves your attention. After around half a dozen digital point and shoots over the years, I feel like I finally found one that measures up.""

With Canons new CMOS senser, it is above all other digital camera sensors.12.1 megapixel, with a great 20x zoom and a 25mm wide angle lens. The macro is not the best, but the telephoto side is one of the best on a digital camera.One of the cons on the camera is the video recording feature. Though you can record at full 1080p, you can only recording at 24fps. It doesn't have an external mic jack, but not many compact size digital cameras do.And overal 4 Star, and I recommend it for a nice point and shoot. Red, Black, and a forest green color is available for the SX260""
"20120506","5.0","Impressive","Impressive HD video shooting. With this camera, I almost don't want to shoot still anymore but just the video. I'm very happy and want to buy another one for myself...the previous one is for my wife.""

"20120503","5.0","This Could Be the One","I am an experienced amateur photographer and I've owned many cameras over the past 40 years. I've had some photos published but photography has always been strictly a hobby, though a serious one. I shoot with a Canon 7D, Rebel backup, various 'L' lenses, and I also use an Olympus E-P1 occasionally as well as a Canon S90 and Powershot 1100S (kept in my glovebox for 'emergencies.' I enjoy taking pictures.I also enjoy traveling and have traveled around the states as well as visited many foreign countries. I'm sure I echo the frustrations of every photographer out there when I say that choosing which photo equipment to take on a vacation is the most agonizing process in planning a trip.Let me share two experiences--one pleasant, another frustrating. In 2003, I visited New Zealand and took one of Canon's first digital Powershots. It was very small, fit in my pocket, and I could easily whip it out for quick photos. Even though the pictures were not pristine SLR quality, it was easy and fun using that camera and I still enjoy viewing those photos today. I had a pleasant and memorable trip. Second experience: a 10-day tour of China in 2007. I took a DSLR and 3 lenses as well as an HD camcorder, all in the same shoulder bag. It turned out to be total frustration. Instead of being able to enjoy the moment of seeing all that glorious ancient history and the people of China, I was overly concerned with 'getting the shot' -- all the time. Also, HD video was new in those days and I thought I could record the 'trip of a lifetime' with the latest technology. But switching between video and still photography simply added to my frustration. Although I got quite a few good pictures and videos, I did not enjoy that trip as much as I should have because I let my photo-taking desires get in the way of my vacation needs and cultural immersion. As a matter of fact, my wife used a point-and-shoot to get some great candid photos of people and children that totally outshone my efforts.OK, fast forward to 2012. Like so many other photographers out there, when traveling I need a camera that's pocketable but can do everything. Impossible. It doesn't exist. But I remember the lessons learned from the experiences described above. Concessions must be made. With experience, I've learned what is a necessity, and what 'would be nice to have' when traveling. I have concluded that for me, a camera that takes 'very good' pictures, that is small and lightweight, is a NECESSITY. Anything else would be 'nice to have' but is not worth the enormous hassle.I've had the Powershot SX260 HS for about a week now and I think I may have found the camera that will adequately meet my travel needs. I've shot a couple hundred photos and I'm surprised at the results. They are sharp, contrasty, colorful, noiseless, and good enough to use as desktop pictures on my 24-inch monitor without editing. The 20x lens is coupled to a shake-free technology that is very, very good. It's pocketable and has easy to use buttons that are logically placed. Canon has done their homework in finding the right balance between sharpness and noise, as far as I am concerned. Although it doesn't shoot RAW (that's a debate for another time), I am very happy with the JPEGs and I use the included highlight-taming technology built in to the camera and it works very well.What I like:1) Pocketable. Pocketable. Did I say pocketable?2) Turns on quickly to get the shot.3) 20x lens -- 25mm to 500mm. The 25mm shots are corrected internally for distortion and the 500mm shots are sharp thanks to the IS technology.4) Very good noise control -- I haven't tested it at 1600 or 3200 but several other review sites reveal surprising, low noise photos at those ISO levels.5) My copy is very sharp -- no need to sharpen the photos it produces.6) Color accuracy is on par with my Olympus E-P1, which I consider to be the paragon of color accuracy.7) Full manual when desired.8) Takes very good HD video -- though that doesn't interest me so much these days. IS corrects for camera shake in video mode and zooming works well.What I don't like:Nothing yet, though I will update this review if anything comes up.Does this camera take pictures comparable to my 7D? No. My E-P1? Very close. My S90? Superior to the S90 in my view.The 20x zooming feature of this camera can't be overstated -- it's wonderful.So many reviewers nitpick about technical matters. Sure, I could do that with any camera, including this one. But the point is--what need does the camera serve? All I know is this: If this camera had existed at the time, the SX260 would be the camera I would have taken to China.Highly recommended.[UPDATE: Many people have asked me about the so-called 'squeal' in video mode. When ambient sounds are low, the condenser mic (as in all cameras) boosts the gain. Most cameras will then pick up the internal motor/electronic sounds. This camera is no exception. The noise I've noticed is a very subtle high pitched ring similar to tinnitus. Am I surprised? No. It's the same sound I've heard in every video unit I've owned in the past 25 years. Medium to loud sounds will cause the mic to adjust and the tinnitus disappears. Folks, if video is important, buy a dedicated video camera. This is a PHOTO camera that has video capability, which is what I wanted.]""
"20120503","5.0","best camera you can buy under $700","This is the best camera you can buy at this price. I feel like i wasted money buying my SLR camera because I rarely take it out because it's so big, heavy, awkward, and even embarrassing. Please go to a huge retail store and play with this camera and compare it to all others, you'll see it's the best camera out now based on specs, design and performance.  I also have a nikon s9100 which is slightly inferior to this camera in both design (accidentally turns on all the time) and performance(and we all know its either canon or nikon for best photos). Please read the cnet reviews and and any other reviews on this camera. Compact megazooms are taking over. Any review you read will be comparing this camera's performance to a thousand dollar SLR set up. I print flawless 8x10 pictures with this camera. Save your money and buy this camera because the best camera is the one you have on you. Who wants to carry around a backpack when this canon fits in any shirt pocket and gives you excellent photos with excellent manual controls and an excellent auto mode. Go play with it at the store, and than buy it on amazon where you know its cheaper. Probably the best point and shoot of the year.""

"20120427","3.0","No Squeal But No Audio Either","I bought this camera new from a reputable shopping website. Arrived inappropriately boxed with rattle inside box. Set up charge & camera, & worked with the video 3 times, chatting all the way through for the microphone to record in stereo.  I must have gotten a dud because not only did I not have the 'squeal' everyone has noted, but also didn't have the audio on playback, either. No sound whatsoever, even with my chatty voice. It's a brand new camera with a hefty price, so can't figure out why it continues to have problems.  No, didn't mess with the controls before the video, just started the video with the correct button. Video was nice with bright colors, but still wanted some sound. Of course, had to return it and it was nice as I got the green one. Going back to Nikon.""

Because warned regarding the video, I specifically ordered this camera in 2 different colors, hoping that one of them would be 'perfect.'  The picture quality is fabulous, but BOTH of them have an obvious and annoying squeal to the video.  Even though I'm getting it primarily as a camera and don't  currently take a ton of video, I would certainly like the product that I am purchasing to function as it should.  To be specific, I ordered one red and one green.  Both were made in Japan.  Sadly, I am going to return them and must continue with my search.""

The zoom feature is one of the reasons for purchasing this particular model and was worth the research. It has a GPS feature that I have not used as of yet but am going to in the near future. I am working on family tombstones and the clarity is excellent when I add to our family tree.""
"20120421","5.0","Great camera ever! Go get it and you never go wrong!","I bought the canon cameras from generations to generations and the CMOS DIGIC 5 with HS system is the best ever! SX260 has so many features that you need to learn and try it in a different way at every time and condition, not always using Auto all the times, thats what this camera made for. So if it get blurry that means you have to find the right way.I also have a Canon DSLR XSI which is a great camera too but compare to SX260,  this camera still much better! That means, It the time to upgrade a new DSLR camera with CMOS DIGIC 5. So go get it and you never go wrong!""
"20120421","3.0","Not crazy about where flash is","I just purchased this camera used it for a couple of days while it does take great photos the flash is located right where you hold the camera.  I even had others take photos and they kept putting their finger right where the flash pops up. Due to this I am returning it not sure why Canon would place flash in an area that your finger would be placed.""
"20120420","4.0","Love the photo and video,","After reading many reviews about the video, I originally thought my video sound was okay when I got my new SX260 until I compared it to my SX230. I shot a quick video with both using the same SD card. There is definitely a sound difference. My SX230 sound is totally clear. On the SX260 it's not a squeal like the other posts, but an evident equipment hiss during playback. I'm going to try another SX260 and compare. I don't mind a subtle sound as long as it does not cover up my video subject sounds.UPDATE:The second SX260 DID have the so-called 'squeal.' Again, my first one only had a hiss (kind of like air), but not the squeal. The second SX260 had the squeal for certain. I can see how others are annoyed by the squeal. I know this is a camera and not a camcorder, however there are those precious moments that need to be shot by video from time to time. My decision will be to keep the hissing SX260 or my quiet SX230. The squealing SX260 is going back.UPDATE II (5/17/12):After trying 4 of these cameras, I found one that did not squeal! It was worth the extra time and effort as I truly enjoy this camera and will give my SX230 to my daughter now. I find myself using my SX260 more than my S100 and my SX40. I also have two DSLR's that I use when I need exceptional quality, but for ease of use, the SX260 takes the cake!!""
"20120418","5.0","Another Great Canon Camera","As 'advanced amateurs' my wife and I have owned numeous Canon cameras and camcorders, as well as several other makes over the years. When we learned of the new Canon SX260 with a 20X zoom we immediately checked it out and then purchased one through Amazon.com. It arrived just before the April, 2012 Washington DC Cherry Blossom Festival began so our first use was to record the beautiful cherry blossoms at the Tidal Basin. We both own earlier Canon ELPH's, an SD700 and SD850, which are great little 4X 'point & shoots' for carrying with us everywhere we travel, so we wanted to see the comparison in quality, as well as to utilize the greater 20X zoom capabilities of the the SX260 which coincides nicely with my Canon 20X Vixia HD camcorder.The quality of the zoom photos is excellent and the IS feature is very effective. All our first day shots were 'hand-held' but, as with any longer zoom, a tripod always assures better quality. Photo 're-cycle' time is very good and the larger LCD screen is nice but we missed the Viewfinder of our ELPH's as the sun sometimes made the LCD hard to see. The SX260 is slightly larger than our ELPH's and the position of the 'pop-up' flash interferes slightly with a good finger grip on the top left of the camera. We have not used the GPS feature as yet but wished we could have had it during a recent trip to Italy. We are still exploring other features so may 'update' this review later.Overall, we are extremely pleased with the new SX260 and would highly recommend it to people looking for an easy to carry small camera that has considerably more than just a minimum capability.""
"20120416","5.0","Great camera, and good video.","Great camera, takes great pictures and feels good in your hands. I like a bigger point a shoot, so this one felt good, and does not feel like it's made of cheap materials. The zoom is great, and I've never had unfocused pictures.About the hiss, I do not hear a loud hiss when I made videos in 1080p, but just like every other point and shoot, there is some noise when its quite. I am going to use this camera to take pictures, and only a small amount of videos. I figure that if you need a video camera, I would recommended getting a video camera instead of a point and shoot!Anyways, overall this is a great camera, and takes great pictures with an awesome zoom. I've been testing it for about 3 weeks now, and the battery is pretty good.I am going to Europe in the next few months and will update this review. Hope this review is helpful!Luis""
"20120414","1.0","great pictures and video quality.....but...","I recently purchased this Canon SX260HS from a retail store.  I have a Canon SX110IS which I have owned for 4 years and have been very happy with. I had been looking for a camera that will do some short hi-definition videos.  The SX260HS has 12 megapixels, 20x optical zoom and HD video at 1920 x 1080.  After taking it home and trying it out, I found the pictures and video quality to be breathtaking. The photo and video detail was absolutely amazing......BUT......there was this annoying constant high pitched squeal that was just loud enough to drown out the sound of birds chirping in the distance or other 'not so loud' noises.  You could hear it whether playing back the video either in the camera or on the computer.  The only time you might not notice the constant squeal was if the video was being shot in a very noisy area. After paying about $360 for the camera, I decided to take it back to the store. I'll wait after reading many many more reviews before I make my next camera purchase. For now, I am happy with my very QUIET playback SX110IS, even if it isn't high definition.""
"20120412","4.0","Great camera, but..","I recommend Canon digital cameras before I would recommend any other brand. I have been buying Canon products for several years now and they consistently take great pictures and are very user friendly. The battery life is also very good. However, if I had one complaint, it would be that the camera is a fragile. I dropped my powershot during vacation and it was gone. Dead. The shutter was smashed in. I have since replaced my camera, but I was a bit disappointed by its low durability.""

I took several pictures, the quality of pictures is nice.But, after recording video using this camera and playback, I heard that squeal sound, like other people experienced and posted in here.I think it is the defect of this camera. I will return it to the seller. If they can find one which has no this defect, I still want this SX260 HS. Otherwise, I want refund.Seems this is the defect of this new released camera. So, I would suggest that if you want to buy this camera, the better to wait for next 2-3 months, then to see.There are video which were posted by the buyers who have this problem also. I quote in here (see comments )for your reference.UPDATE:After waiting for another two weeks, I purchased this one again. This is my fourth SX260HS after returned previous three because of high pitched sound of video.This new one is great! No high pitched sound of video, and pictures quality is still pretty good. I also satisfy its lower-light shot. Not bad.The con is, so far, the Auto mode. When focusing on yellow flower, on the screen, it is kind of whiten. Another con is a little bit of slow when focusing.""

It has a perfect size, the grip can be a little tricky specialy when the flash comes out, because it's hidden and pops out when you are going to use it. The pictures and the video quality are very good, and the zoom is excelent. I really like the feature of the night shots. The lowest point I think is the battery life, specially with the GPS on. Overall I think it's an excelent pocket camera.""
"20120411","2.0","Blurry Pictures","I was very excited to order this camera because I have had great experiences with Canon Powershot cameras; however, this camera was a dissappointment. I used the camera mostly on Auto. Many of my pictures were blurry with very minimal movement which is surprising since the camera says it has 'image stabilzation'.""
"20120407","5.0","Almost perfect travel camera!","I purchased this camera a full month before it was released on Amazon for an upcoming trip to southeast asia. As luck would have it, it arrived the day before my flight took off. I've had good luck with Canon cameras in the past and their picture quality is among the best. The SX260 caught my interest mainly because of the 20x zoom. There are already a couple of reviews going into detail about all of the features so I won't be redundant. Just let me say that there are more features than you will probably use. I will play around with the myriad of shooting modes from time to time, but mostly I will do 99% of my shooting in P mode, tweaking settings as I desire on the fly. I love the GPS feature; I will keep it permanently on so that all of my pics are geo-tagged. The Canon imagebrowser software that comes with the camera will show you the exact location on Google earth where the pic was taken. Pretty cool! I used the movie digest feature during my trip and like it very much. The camera will record three second snippets of video before each pic is taken then stitch them all together into one video. Again, pretty cool! The battery life was a major complaint on the previous model SX230. I did not have any battery life issues with this camera, but then again, I only take about 50 to 60 pictures in a day. I spent several days exploring the Khmer temples in Cambodia, taking my 50 to 60 pictures and at the end of the day the battery level indicator was at half.  If you take a lot of pics then you may want an extra battery. With my shooting style, the battery life is fine. The picture quality is excellent. The somewhat slow lens gave me a little pause when I was making a purchasing decision, but it turns out that the CMOS sensor coupled with the HS system more than makes up for it. Turns out this camera is the best low-light performer I have had. I love the zoom. 20x optical plus 4x digital means a full 80x. I took a lot of pics at 80x during my trip and was pleased with the results. Even at 80x, the image stabilization was able to give me a clear pic in full sunlight. I found that I needed to steady myself in lower light to get a clear shot which is to be expected. The camera feels sturdy and has a nice 'heft' for its size. I did drop it twice onto solid concrete (not like me at all) during my trip with no ill effects, thank God. So I guess it is solidly built inside as well. My only gripe with this camera is the very annoying location of the flash. It pops up where you naturally want to put your finger. Many times, my finger was in the way when it tried to pop up and it 'jammed' causing an error message that said to turn the camera off and then back on. That always corrected it but I was afraid I would eventually cause it to break. I considered downgrading the rating to four stars because of this but eventually I trained myself to place my finger behind where the flash pops up and no longer do I have any issues with this.""
"20120405","3.0","Great on average, but Auto mode not great. Beware video squeal!","NOTE: My previous review stated some strong concerns about a high-pitched audio frequency coming through all the videos. We exchanged the first camera, but the 2nd was not pronounced enough to ding the review significantly for. I have revised the star rating to match, though I'm not convinced it's gone...Let me preface by saying that I've been buying and recommending Canon digitals for over 10 years. In fact I still have my old silver PowerShot S60 stowed away in my drawer, and the SX260 HS is probably our 9th Canon. I'm starting to wonder if that's actually a GOOD sign or not, as the longevity of every new model seems to suffer...After our SX230 began putting out more and more WEIRDLY colored photos in P-Auto mode (in full, healthy sunlight no less where Canons have always shined), we started shopping other brands. There's a lot of good cameras out there but between the Nikon's noise, and the Sony's dull brown colors we always returned what we had and waited for the next in the SX series.Now that we have it, my wife has been really happy with the photo quality in most situations, however the AUTO mode which advertises as being 'so intelligent' misses the mark on MANY occasions. Especially around kids and low light. Every kids photo comes out blurry, so inevitably I return to P mode and manually up the ISO or force the flash to compensate.The video of the last couple generations has been fantastic in HD, although there is a bit of ambient audio hiss in this model which we don't notice in our older videos.On average though, I can recommend this camera.""
"20120329","3.0","Great Travel Camera! BUT I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE VIDEO","I am revising my review because I just returned the camera to Canon. On reviewing the videos taken in quiet rooms, I found that I had clicks and whirs. Perhaps it is something about the autofocus mechanism but a properly designed microphone shouldn't be picking up internal sounds.The quality of the video, apart from the sound, is excellent. The camera's performance indoors in situations like museums and restaurants is great. The AWB is not as good as the one on the Nikon S8100 (but the lens mechanism seems to be better than Nikon's, which failed). The zoom and image stabilization are fantastic for both video and stills. I am hoping that Canon gives corrects the problem because as a travel camera, having this much zoom and quality of video in a pocket-size package is great. If they can fix the sound problem, I'll change the review back to the 5 star I first gave it.Here's the rest of original review:I just got the camera yesterday so I haven't gone anywhere. How can I say it's a great travel camera?  Last summer I traveled for 30 days in China, carrying a backpack, roller bag, and a ScottEVest. As much as I would love to take an SLR, the weight of the camera and lenses I would need, plus being alone with a prominent camera, make taking an SLR impractical and unwise.  I was very happy with the NIkon S8100, but I went through two of them (scratched lens on the first; 'lens error' on the second. After reading other's experiences trying to get Nikon, I decided to  come back to Canon. I looked the Sony travel zooms too and they looked like excellent choices, but I have had good luck with Canon.While I had glanced at the manual online, once the camera arrived, I wanted to start shooting right away. I didn't wait to  give the battery a full charge. The controls are fairly intuitive (finding the scene modes takes  a bit of practice). The Auto and Easy focus modes work great (I need to read up on the difference; apparently you can easily change settings in the Easy mode, but I have only turned off the flash.). Reviews of the SX230 had complained about the flash automatically popping up and the position. When you are out of the Easy mode, the flash stays down even after you turn it off. In the Easy mode, it pops up after you turn it off if it needs light.The default for the GPS is apparently off when it comes out of the box. When I found I had no GPS data (there's map software that uses Google Maps), I turned it on and took more pictures outside. The SX230 reviews had complained that  the camera often wouldn't shoot if it didn't have a GPS fix. I didn't experience that, but I also have an acre and clear shot of the sky. When I checked the track log in the software, I found that at the closest zoom level I had a track that showed all of my wanderings around my yard. iPhoto picked up the location data without any problem. Pictures in Picasa showed the precise location but the default setting hides the location so you don't have to worry about your privacy if you wish to hide it. With the proper setting in Flickr, you get a nice map of the locations in your uploads with precise locations you never even heard of. iy home shows up with the name of the subdivision plot. The only other place I have seen that is on my property deed and the county assessor maps.. I have both a Mac and a PC; there are versions of the software for both. However, I probably won't be using it since I use Lightroom and iPhoto. Both the Mac and the PC had no problem recognizing the camera and transferring the pictures.I tried a few of the scene and effect modes and they seem to work fine. The Supervivid gave a very impressive brightly colored picture of my neighbor's field and horses (see my uploaded images). The 'fisheye' worked as expected. I shot some  'Very Low Light' pictures and the camera worked well even though I didn't use a tripod; however, the version that showed up when I tried to upload it to the Amazon gallery didn't show a tree caught in the moonlight. I guess that was because of the compression.The video mode works fine and is accessible with a red record button so you don't have to dial up the video setting which is on the dial. The microphone is very sensitive. I could hear the cars  passing on the street 150 yards away (we don't have any buildings between the road and us that dampens the sound). HOWEVER, you can also hear the zoom motor sometimes so if  you are going to make video, it would be best to shoot, stop the shot, zoom in or out, and then shoot again. You can see some of the video in my Flickr photostream; I am eslbruce. Of course, when you zoom  at the extreme ranges, you do get camera jerking and moving when you are just holding the camera with your hands.I have ordered three extra aftermarket batteries and a charger for my travels. I expect the GPS to drain the battery; hopefully , four batteries will do the trick. In an unusual setting like the Forbidden City or Summer Palace in Beijing, I can easily shoot over 1000 pictures in a day. One review said they got 300 shots from the camera using flash half the time; I am not sure they had the GPS on though.The choices of size of pictures leap from 12mpxl to 6 mpxl for medium. I would prefer 8, but 6 mpxl would still be plenty large enough for a 5x8. The camera comes with no SD card; I ordered four of the AmazonBasic Type 6 SD cards for less than $9 each. It handles the HD video fine with no stuttering or buffer overrun.This review is after less than 24 hours. If something comes up and I decide that the camera has problems and is less than five stars, I will come back and revisit it.""
"20120320","5.0","Another winner from Canon","I received my SX260 last Wednesday and have taken about 700 shots and a few quick 5 minute video. Without writing a novel, here are the high/low points of this unit. In addition to this unit, I also purchased a couple of aftermarket batteries (and after market A/C adapters for about $5.00 each) for about $5.00 each and the batteries work fine. With the battery (original and aftermarket) I was able to get over 300 shots (50% flash) with zooming and playback and the battery meter still showed about 25% charge remaining.Pro'sZoom - very long for a subcompact camera 20x optical, total 81x combined (yes 81 times!)Image Stabilizer - Excellent (far superior than the DSC-HX9V); Even at 81x the picture did not come out of focus, but of course not as sharp. I think it's still acceptableScenes - A few scenes; I think the portrait, sepia, B/W works real well (the Portrait+ suppose to blur the picture a bit, but it's not to my liking) It has a few effects (fish eye, toy, miniature) that's very effective and can be fun for creative shots.Auto Mode - was able to pick the correct type of scene almost all the time; it has an easy mode, and smart auto. Not sure why they have an easy mode, but the smart auto works greatSize/Weight - very compact and weigh's 8.2 oz. I would have prefer if the lens was flushed with the unit, but at 20x it may not have been possibleUniformity - the unit does not feel cheap, and beautifully curved; no sharp jagged cornersGrip - the right side of the camera has a nice plastic strip for easier gripControls - Dial extremely easy to use with one hand. The other buttons, if you're a previous Canon user, it's a no brainer; the menu and setup are practically the same across all their models.Screen - 3 inch TFT LCD screen very beautiful; nuff saidProcessor - Didn't notice that much difference between the DIGIC 4/DIGIC 5, but compared to the DSC-HX9V, this camera is like a Ferrari.GPS - Camera has it, but I never used it and probably won't; at least for the time being. Am more interested in a camera that takes excellent pictureCon'sVideo - compared to the Sony DSC-HX9V this Canon comes in a distant second; if you plan on using this primarily as a video recorder, look elsewhere. I think Sony has excellent lens on their camera but their processing technology is clumsy, painfully slow and unacceptable; whereas with taking videos, the Sony does not do any processing (not to mention it captures at 60fps compared to Canon's 24/25 fps) This is one thing I will miss dearly.Flash - not sure if there is a good place but I had to change my grip as the flash is on the top left corner. Couple of times, I had my left index finger on the flash and the camera gave some flash error message and had to power off and power on the camera to reset the flash.If you're a casual or intermittent photographer (or a professional wanting an everyday point and shoot camera without carrying a luggage everywhere) that is interested in looking for a well refined point and shoot camera, yet has manual controls usually found on higher end DSLR (or higher end point and shoot camera), this is it!UPDATE 04/14/2012 - I paid $349 and today I noticed it's selling for $299, a 15% price drop in less than a month! I thought cars depreciate quick ...UPDATE 04/18/2012 - The Live Mode works great! For those hard shots (for example, taking indoor picture with fluorescent lighting and without a flash), you can view the screen and make the adjustment right then and there. You look at what you plan to take, compare it to the SX260 LCD screen and press the shutter button.""
