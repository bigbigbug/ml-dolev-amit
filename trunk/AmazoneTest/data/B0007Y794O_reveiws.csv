"20120529","5.0","Awesome Lens!","I have not had an opportunity to use this lens to its capacity but it is very nicely done. If you are going to do any type of photography outside which requires an adequate zoom this lens is for you. definately worth the money.""
"20120525","3.0","Good not Great-3.5 stars","I won't get to technical since there are quite a few photo websites that have full reviews on this lens.I got the lens for use on a budget, cropped sensor Canon T3. The lens is not a top performer BUT it is certainly not priced in that range either. And this lens does produce very good images.  To be honest, much better images than I expected for an extended zoom in this price range. The IS works well & I can't imagine buying a lens in this focal range w/o good IS.  The focusing is not a quick as some & at times it does search (see below*) but I would still rate its focus as better than average.  And the optics do seem to be significantly better than you would expect for a long zoom in this price range.If you're not really happy with the typical extended zoom that Canon seems to be including in their kits now-a-days (the 55-250 mm or the 75-300 - w/ or w/o USM) AND you don't have the money or inclination to go with the 70-200mm L series- give this one a try.  You won't drop a bundle (I watched for a while & ended up getting mine here on Amazon for under $350 new) and you'll get better results than with the bottom end lens. If you don't like it you can sell it on amazon or ebay and get most or all of your money back, as long as you shop around & you're careful what you pay for it, to use for a different lens.*The lens sometime had difficulty focusing beyond 200mm & if the image was some distance off and/or did not stand out.  If you run into this you can overcome this as long as you don't mind an extra step or two.  Try focusing on something fairly similar but only about half the distance away.  Once your camera & lens has pulled in & processed that info, then try focusing again the your actual subject.  I know that sounds like a pain, and certainly won't work in a sports situation, but it does typically get you a better image when your camera processor & lens just can't pick up what you're after.**as an fyi, I am keeping this lens for now but I picked up the Canon 50mm 1.8 for about $100 here on Amazon & it's now about the only lens I use on the T3. But just so you know, I don't use any zoom as much as I used too**""
"20120508","5.0","Very nice lens","I got my wife a new camera, a Canon Rebel T3i, after using her old camera, a Canon Powershot S5 IS, to shoot a full moon rise.  The moon rise photo would have been very good but it was a dark moon rise (the sun had set maybe 15 minutes before) so when I brightened up the landscape it was a bit noisy (not a lot but more than I wanted).  We had driven quite a long distance to see this so a better camera seemed reasonable.  The next full moon was the Super Moon of May 05, 2012.  We got the camera with the 18-55 mm kit lens but decided to go with the EF 70-300 mm IS USM lens instead of the 75-300 mm lens that was also available in a kit.  On some practice shots of the moon before the full moon I was getting some pretty sharp views.  As I learned more about the camera the technique improved, like using Live View which avoided the mirror bounce, using a shutter release cable, and zooming to 10X which showed that my old tripod would shake for 5 seconds or so and then be steady enough to see the image motion from the earth's rotation.  I also calculated that at 300 mm zoom I needed to keep the shutter speed to faster than about 1/10 second to avoid more than about 1/2 pixel image smear because I wasn't tracking the moon.  The resulting pictures were quite sharp, better than what I had found out on the web when I looked for moon photos through this lens.  When I showed an employee at Best Buy one of the images on my iPod he said I hadn't got it with that lens, I said yes I did.  I used autofocus on the moon.  But it didn't work on the stars or planets with Live View so I tried a trick, autofocus on the moon, switch the lens to manual focus, then point to the star or planet.  Wasn't sure that would work but it did.  I pointed at Saturn and was able to detect the rings.  Not very well, no dark space between the rings and the planet (I think that will be possible when they open up a bit more in 2 or 3 years).  The crescent of Venus was also visible with this lens.  Haven't tried Jupiter yet but it should show a disk and moons.  Mars should also show a disk when it is close enough.  I'm not suggesting this is a good lens for shooting planets, I just tried it to see how sharp it is and was happy with it.My wife finally got to try this lens when we went to find some eagles.  They were mostly far away but her first shot clearly showed some and the image stabilization worked very well.  By pressing the shutter halfway the stabilization is activated and the image really gets steady.  That was one reason I went with this lens.We went to see the Super Full Moon rise and found a few members of the local camera club there with their big lenses.  A Super Full Moon is not really a big deal, it's just when the full moon happens near when the moon, in its elliptical orbit, is closest to the earth.  It's a bit bigger (apparent size) and a bit brighter than other full moons.  The weather wasn't promising and at moon rise time nothing was seen, but maybe 20 minutes later or so a bit of it was seen peeking through the clouds and it finally got up out of the haze.  Got some shots with this lens.  The full moon in November 28 is the farthest from earth full moon of the year, I guess that would be a submoon, opposite of the supermoon.  The apparent diameters of the May 5 and Nov 28 full moons will differ by about 14%.Back to the lens, there are only a couple of negatives I can think of so far, and they may not be a problem for everybody.  The lens cap could be better, might not be able to use it with a lens hood in place.  That's easy to replace.  Also the front of the lens rotates and will be an issue with polarizing filters.  This may not be a big deal, haven't tried it yet, but the following may work.  Zoom, focus, adjust the polarizer, then focus again.  The last step may not be needed and should be such a minor adjustment that the polarizer should be ok.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this lens.Update 2012 May 18:  I read another review that said this lens could autofocus on a star.  In the above I stated I couldn't autofocus even on Venus but I was using Live View, not the optical view finder.  When I tried the optical view finder it focussed on Venus with no problem and I got a handheld shot at 300 mm that showed it as a small crescent.""

"20101009","4.0","Good Quality for the Money, but no Sony 70-300G","I recently switched from Sony to Canon.  I really like the Canon cameras.I consider myself semi-pro and use a 7D and 40D.  I have to saythat I struggle with Canon glass after using Sony/Minolta for so long.The 70-300USM IS is a good lens, but I would not say great and I used3 different lenses of this model to ensure that I got the sharpest that Icould find.  I also did this with the 7D.If you want the sharpest camera/lens you will find that there can be verylarge variations in different batches of cameras/lenses for quality.I found the older the lens of this model to be the softest and the focushunt was much more pronounced.I also own a Canon 100-400L and it is very good in the field although itweighs a lot compared to the 70-300USM IS and the cost is any where fromdouble to triple depending on used or new deals.I find the images soft at 300mm, the AF is slow and on wildlife hunts and oftendoes not lock, but for the money and mobility it is a keeper until Canon offerssomething similar with better quality.I tried the 55-250 and if you are looking for sharpness pass on this lens. If you arelooking for a good all around lens its okay and smaller than the 70-300USM IS.This lens is okay from a semi-pro perspective and if I had not used the Sony 70-300Glens so extensively before switching I would probably be happier with this lens.""
"20100926","4.0","A Nice Compromise","Easy to hand hold at 300mm because of the IS, less expensive than the better Canon 70-300 IS lenses and better optical quality than the less expensive Sigma. The trade offs of less durable construction and a not-fully-silent focusing motor are acceptable to me. Had I not needed this lens immediately for a trip I would have waited to compare it to the announced, but not yet available Tamron 70-300 with stabilization. All said, I am very happy with it.""

The Canon 70-300mm is a great lens, and were it not for the price point of the 20-200 L, it would be an unreserved recommendation.  The L just has a little better color, contrast, clarity and all that.Like all other zooms of this general design I have tried (rotating front element), the shorter focal lengths are great, but the longest focal lengths are less so.  This lens is really sharp up to about 180mm, but less so at 300mm.""

I was concerned of the reports I read that it was not well made and that there was excessive motor noise compared to other Canon USM lenses. Well, recently I took it up to the Canadian Rockies to do some wildlife photography and it performed admirably. No bothersome noise. Well made, just the same build quality as the standard lens that came with my 40D. The picture quality at 300mm is excellent. I'm very pleased with this lens and think its great for amateur photographers looking for a versatile zoom lens in the ~$550 range.""

"20100617","5.0","Zoom barrell could move easier","The only negative I have noticed so far is that the zoom barrel does not turn as easily as I would like (like the kit lens does in the Canon Rebel XSi).  I do not know if this is a design feature to prevent gravity from rolling the zoom barrel out or not.  Sometimes I have to look at the zoom barrel to see if it's not moving because I'm at the end or because I just didn't turn it hard enough.  I would rather not have to look ever.The IS is amazing... if you take several shots rapid fire at a really low shutter speed, you can still get one that is sharp.  I find that after the first few shots, my hand gets steadier.Everything else seems great!This does not have to do with the lens specifically, but for those wondering how far a 300mm lens can go - For small animals like tiny birds, you can't be too far away or they will just be too small.  If they're perched on a second floor balcony and you are on the ground about 15 feet away, you can get them to take up a good amount of the picture but you can't zoom in on their eye or anything.  If you like to zoom in really close to small animals that are skittish, from what I've heard, you can probably get away with using a 400mm lens without a tripod, I would recommend that.Also 70mm is a little too zoomed in if you want to use it also to shoot your friends that are hanging out with you in a room.  If you move like 10 feet away, you can get a picture, but I felt like I had to back up a little too much.  It's still possible though.  It made me start thinking about getting an 18mm-200mm to get the large range.  Changing lenses is a hassle :)""

I am not a professional photographer, but consider myself an advanced hobbyist and still learning.  When I first received my new lens, I took it outside on an overcast day and took some scenery shots using the 50D camera body.  I took several shots of the same subject (some plants) with different zoom settings.  I also took corresponding shots at zoom setting of 70mm and 100mm using the EF 24-105mm F/4L with the same settings (aperture=7.1, shutter=1/200, ISO=800, etc.) with the same 50D camera body.I did a 'one-to-one' comparison of these shots on the computer.  The shots with the 24-105mm F/4L showed better contrast and color saturation; however, the sharpness of the two lenses appeared to be comparable.  The 70-300mm shots for higher zooms (135mm, 200mm, and 300mm) also showed about the same IQ as the 70mm and 100mm zooms.  I also cropped the 100mm zoomed picture from the 24-105mm L to correspond to the same uncropped picture taken with 300mm zoomed picture from the 70-300mm and made a 'direct' comparison.  There was a noticeable improvement in detail with the uncropped 70-300mm, primarily due to higher resolution.The 70-300mm is not quite L quality; however, a very good lens for the price.""

Two way IS for vertical and horizontal stabilization. It really works. I tried both ways and it works like gem. I tried shooting the moon at night and result was fantastic.

At near maximum zoom it filled the frame with the action.  I recently attended an Indy car race.  I could shoot the cars right across from me very well and get decent shots of the cars across the track.  The image stabilization gave excellent clarity even at maximum zoom.  The AF focus point on your Canon SLR may need to be narrowed.  Occasionally the camera autofocus would lock onto the guard rail or fence post rather than the car.  A little experimentation with the camera adjustment will allow you to use this lens in a predictable manner.  The weight and balance is good.  I had no hand fatigue from using it all day.""
"20100401","5.0","Superior lens for the price","I own a Canon T1i camera. In looking for a long range lens above 200mm, I read reviews on both Amazon and other commercial sites. I was looking for a lens with image quality above 200mm but did not want to incur the cost of purchasing one of the excellent Canon 'L' lenses. Further, I wanted Image Stabilization and USM if possible. During reviews, I found that this zoom lens came as close to a full 5-star rating as any on the market in the non-L category. Since obtaining the lens, it has complimented my two other lenses quite nicely, one being the Canon 18-135mm 'walk-around' lens and the super-fine Canon 17-55mm 2.8 IS USM non-L lens. The Bokeh is unbelievable; the sharpness of detail is as good as I could have desired. During a recent trip to the Canaveral National Seashore, I was able to get distant photos of Alligators and Roseate Spoonbill birds that were exceedingly sharp. And I was able to use the Canon IS feature to take shots at 250-300mm without a tripod.I now find that I am spoiled. While I went into this purchase with my eyes wide open, this lens starts at 70mm; my great 17-55mm lens ends at 55mm. While my 18-135mm is a very good walk-around lens, I find myself missing the image quality that I have with my 17-55mm and the 70-300mm lenses. This causes me, so far, to do most of my shooting with the 17-55mm and the 70-300mm creating the need to change lenses too frequently between the 17-55mm and the 70-300mm. I give up the walk-around feature that I enjoyed with the 18-135mm. Perhaps this will change in time and I will again start using my older 18-135mm for the purpose intended - a walk-around lens that I keep on my camera most of the time. But as I said, I have really been spoiled with this new 70-300mm lens.""

"20100314","5.0","Read many comparisons with 70-200 f/4L","I read nearly every review and discussion about the Canon 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens, especially as compared with the Canon 70-200mm f/4L IS USM, and finally bought the 70-300 yesterday for my new Rebel T2i (550D). Particular concerns others have had were sharpness vs. the L, non-ring USM, and the extending, rotating lens barrel.So far I'm quite satisfied. Shooting at f/8 I've gotten some very nice test shots, including fast AF lock and good sharpness at 300mm on a flying seagull (which fills my computer monitor width at 100%).Sharpness at 200mm and 300mm seem about the same, but I like the extra reach of 300mm, either to fill the frame or to downsample for more sharpness. I think the biggest variable in the sharpness of my test photos is what part of the scene I lock focus on (as in a landscape with a lot of depth); I'd conclude from my best shots that the lens itself is quite sharp. I'm still learning the camera and lens.The extending, rotating lens barrel seems minor vs. the much greater cost, less reach, and greater size of the L lens. While shooting seagulls the AF didn't lock on plain blue sky and went blurry, so I quickly refocused on a building before looking for the next bird.I found sample images most useful to me, so I posted some of mine so far at [...] (Google my name with Canon 70-300).""

When using the IS, remember to keep the shutter half-way pushed for about a second before shooting, which allows the IS to kick in.On my 40D, I felt this lens was a bit tight due to the crop factor. I picked up a 5D (original version) and the lens came to life. I really like the combination and have decided to put off getting a 70-200L for a while. This will do just fine. I just have to decide what wide angle zoom to get, now (probably the 17-40L).My gripes with this lens are minimal; the lens does extend when it zooms; the rotating focus element is not a problem for me. Sometimes I forget to change the lens settings on the lens (mode 1 or 2, AF on or off). It's just something I have to learn.""
"20100123","5.0","A good telephoto lens: pros and cons","This lens is very useful for different purposes. Not only as a zoom-in lens that allows you to approach distant subjects but also I find it suitable for portrait photography. In fact, you can say this is a non-intrusive lens -so to speak, when it comes to taking face close-ups. With other lower focal distance lenses I have noticed that people, and especially children, get bored or uncomfortable. Besides, it's extremely easy to achieve a significant 'bokeh' (diffused background) given the amplification factor that a large focal distance produces. Taking portrait pictures at 300mm the background starts to get out of focus just a few feet behind your subject. The role of aperture is not key anymore because depth of field (DOF) isn't what matters most. The IS works great and the sound it makes isn't too noisy. I have achieved very sharp images even in middle or low light conditions, thanks to this feature. Now the flip side! This lens is heavy and too large for transportation. Definitively it's not a good choice for traveling or if you are concerned for your safety. The lens is expensive and easily catches people's attention. If you hold it for some time in your hands while it is attached to the camera body, you start feeling tiredness.  Due to the weight and size the gravity balance point of the camera shifts from to body to some point along the lens so I tend to grab hold of the latter instead of the camera body, as usually happens with any other lens. When it comes to focusing, the process is a bit slow though I think it's a normal behavior. Under low light conditions (for example, bulb lights) the lens might find it difficult to get a subject into focus.  If that happens the focusing barrel goes back and forward till it gets something into focus. Over all: good lens!!!""

I am sure people will say that the 70-200 f4 L lens blows this lens out in various ways.

I simply couldn't justify spending $500 more to get the 70-200 f4 IS lens.The optical quality of this lens is really good. The pictures are sharp, with beautiful colors and contrast. This lens gives a very pleasing bokeh. Take a look at image 334 of customer images ( African Daisy)  to see what I mean. I haven't extensively tested the speed of Auto Focus, but from whatever little testing I did on flying birds I was satisfied by its performance. And finally the IS feature on this lens works really great.""
"20091205","4.0","I like this lens","I have owned the 70-200 L lens and now I purchased the 70-300 IS. I like the 70-300 IS better and the pictures have been better. Actually I was disappointed when I bought the 70-200L but have not been disappointed with the 70-300 IS. I also owned the 70-300 non IS and would not recommend that one at all.I took pictures when it had rained all day and heavy overcast and the pictures were awesome. I would recommend this lens to anybody that's not professional but wants some nice pics that are close to professional.""
"20091205","4.0","Does the job","When I bought this lens, I was looking for something that had longer reach than my 18-55 kit lens on my XT. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked the lens...though it didn't blow me out of the water.After shooting for a couple years and handling some really nice L series glass, this lens feels crazy cheap. The main thing I dislike about this lens is how the front element extends and rotates when it focuses. Also, you cannot manual focus while it's in AF. Canon NEVER includes the lens hood which sucks but I believe it's necessary especially when shooting facing the sun.Performance:I originally bought this lens to get better images at the local speedway, but have recently used it on my 5d2 to shoot recreational sports. After a few stints in flag football, I realized that it's a terrific lens given you want to get up real close. You have to be really picky w/ the framing and extremely conscious of the backgrounds and distance-to-subject to get decent bokeh. This (http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs084.snc3/15137_180353043674_818528674_2807800_328474_n.jpg) as opposed to this (http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs028.snc3/11563_176623333674_818528674_2780434_578842_n.jpg). It's only a f4-5.6 and not a f2.8, and while great images are not totally dependent on that fact, it would definitely be nice to have those extra stops.The IS is great and has two modes; one for all around IS and one for panning. So that feature coupled with the newer cameras' ISO capabilities = good slow shutter, hand-held performance.But all in all, it's a good bang for buck for the avid amateur. I've listed my gripes but considering all of them, I'd buy this lens again if I was tight on cash but needed the reach. If you can afford it, get a better, faster lens i.e. the 70-200 2.8L.""

"20091202","5.0","Better than Tamron 70-300mm","I bought this lens after using the Tamron 70-300mm lens for about 4 or 5 month. At first I was totally ready to trash the Tamron lens. Due to my economic situation I could not afford replace the Tamron. With time and practice it started producing better and better images quality and I started having more fun with it. The truth is, I was learning how to use it correctly. The Tamron is a good, well made lens at an excellent price which I intend to keep.Now the Canon 70-300mm with IS USM is a totally different class of lens. Twice the price of the Tamron but the IS alone is worth that. Image quality can be anywhere from very good to breathtaking. This lens is very easy to use, well made and looks good. If you can afford this lens, buy it, you'll like it. If money is a little tight, get the Tamron. You'll have fun and become a better photographer as you save your pennys for the Canon 70-300mm IS USM.""

"20091114","4.0","Perfect For Us Soccer Moms","I'm not a pro photographer. It's a hobby. A few years ago when my kids started soccer I needed a great telephoto lens. I went into my local camera shop and told them I needed a great lens to take photos outdoors of my kids on the soccer field. The rep didn't blink twice and handed me this lens. This probably the most used lens in my arsenal for taking outdoor photos. I take mostly photos of my kids and I prefer to catch them off-guard, so I sit to the side and just take shots of them when they aren't really aware. I like that. I get some really meaningful photographs, one of which is one of my favorite photographs. It always makes me smile.I'm sure the pros will say there are better lenses on the market, but really. For me, a mom wanting outdoor photos of her kids playing soccer. This is the best lens. It's also very comfortable and easy to use. It feels good and responds well. I let a friend of mine borrow this several months back and she also took some amazing more artsy photographs with it and she more pro than I'll ever be.Overall, this is a great lens, you can read the specs for product details, I won't go into all that, but know that if you need it for outdoor field-range shots, this is the perfect lens. Soccer moms unite! ;) The only thing that this really needs and I keep forgetting to buy is a hood. Sometimes my photos are too exposed if it's really sunny.""

Its a really great lens for wildlife, and general outdoor shooting because of its range, but as I got used too it I really began to want more than 300mm...L series here I come!!As far as sharpness at 300mm, images still look extremely sharp.  The autofocus works well, but I couldn't get a beep from my camera at 300mm?  My only real complaint is the noise.  The focusing makes a weird plastic rubbing against plastic noise, and it gets a little old. The Image stabilization, which by the way works amazingly, is also a little loud (high pitched whine).  These are just minor complaints though, the lens really impressed me!

"20090812","4.0","Best Canon all-purpose zoom","I bought this lens a few years ago before I got serious about photography. Since then everything else in my kit has slowly been upgraded, but I just never seem to find a good enough reason to replace the 70-300mm.The major downsides of this lens are its slightly kludgy focus with a rotating front ring, and its slightly slow aperture compared to whats available.But then the upsides:1) 3-stop image stabilizer. I can't give this enough praise. I've taken crisp photos at 300mm with 1/15s shutter speed, sharp enough to make it onto Flickr's blog.2) Lightweight - as a travel zoom you can't beat the versatility versus weight.3) Sharpness, colours and contrast are top notch. People who've seen photos from this lens have assumed I had a big white expensive lens, and are shocked when they find out.Sure it feels very flimsy and isn't weather sealed, but the reality is, mine has been to dusty game drives in Africa and air shows on a windy beach, and is still like new. For similar money one can get a 70-200mm F4L, but for me the lack of IS on a 200mm lens is a deal breaker.I've often considered upgrading to the 70-200mm f2.8L IS or 100-400mm f4.5-5.6L, or primes such as the 300mm f4, but every time have to ask myself: as a serious hobbyist (rather than a professional), can I really justify the huge expense when this is almost always good enough?""

"20090731","2.0","Less than satisfactory","I am very disappointed with the performance of this lens. I expected better from Canon since I am a long-time Canon user and have many lenses by them. Images are soft to semi-sharp at all focal lengths. 300mm is never sharp. When enlarged even 25% all images go very soft and become noisy and would be useless for printing. I get much better results with all my other Canon lenses. For the price of this lens I expected much better. My son has a cheaper canon telephoto and gets better images. Looking at the reviews others have written on Amazon, it may be that this particular lens has an inherent optics flaw. The IS works fine in both settings, but the images are still not crisp.""
"20090721","4.0","Great lens for a photographer on a budget!","This is one of my first lenses, so understand that my experience is that of an amateur somewhat new into DSLR.Regardless of that factor though, it is clear to see that this lens is a very good value for the cost.  Comparable lenses in quality cost significantly more money.  Comparable lenses in cost suffer from poorer quality.This lens is an EF lens, meaning unlike its EF-S cousins, it will work on all newer Canon models.  The EF-S lenses cannot be mounted on a full-frame camera as-is.  Thus, for compatibility, it is a good purchase in case you ever want to upgrade your camera (as compared to the 55-250 EF-S lens)The build quality is quite sturdy.  It's significantly larger and heavier than the 18-55mm IS kit lens included with my XSi (450d), which feels a little strange as the bulk of the weight is in the lens as opposed to balanced between the lens and camera body.  It's not too bad though, since in general you'd be using a second hand to steady the lens.Image Stabilization on this lens is great.  I've noticed a significant difference between photos with and without my iS enabled, and have definitely been able to slow the shutter speed down and still take clear photographs.I've only found two flaws with this lens thus far.  One is that the manual focus ring is slightly loose--it's very easy to rotate, though that really isn't an issue for me since I hold the lens slightly closer to the body. (and generally keep in autofocus anyway)  Secondly, I have noticed a slight tendency to hunt for focus when in dark situations.  It's not terrible, but on a couple of occasions I have switched to manual to get a better focus.All in all though, the lens is quite sharp, the image quality is good, and though I haven't tested it that thoroughly yet, the bokeh seems to be nice as well.I strongly recommend this lens for anyone looking to extend the focal range of your lens collection, especially if you are starting new with the 18-55mm IS kit lens like I was.  However, keep in mind the additional size and weight, which are pretty significant considering the kit lens' light plastic build.""

What ever you decide GET AN IS lens.  Trying to hold still at 200mm+ is very hard and even more difficult to get a non blurry image.  I was a little concerned about getting good blur @ f/4-5.6, no worries.Cons:  When zooming, lens extends, though has zoom lockNot all that fast, if your shooting sports get something fasterMinim focus distance is almost 5 feet, that's a lot, can be annoying.""

"20090526","5.0","Incredible Lens","It is difficult to write a review for an item when there are so many other good reviews already present. It is even more difficult to give new feedback on an item that has a lot already said about it.I will start by stating that I am not a professional photographer, nor am I a professional product reviewer.With that said let me state that I am a person that does art, and has done it for a number of years. Photography was a means for me to try and capture my own subjects and scenes. I have a limited budget on photography equipment and cannot always afford the best, or elite items.When I purchased this lens I knew that it was not going to be the fastest lens available, or the one with the highest zoom. I intended to get this for my nature photography to be able to zoom in on objects I see all around me. Instead I found this lens to be an incredible lens for capturing faces, and portraits. I can be in a crowded place, or at a party and this is always my lens of choice. I can capture someone from across the room, and they are unaware of me taking their picture. As a result my photographs are more natural and life like.I have also used this lens for nature shots, and architectural shots. In all the lens is a really nice addition to my equipment.As for a hood, I was able to purchase a cannon hood for the lens, separately. I have used the hood on numerous occasions. The size of the lens is not too bad, and storage is not a problem.In all I would recommend this lens to anyone that needed an affordable zoom.""

I also own the 28-135 mm  lens, which is a great all purpose lens.""
"20090515","4.0","Good, not great lens..","I bought this lens about 2 years ago and have taken some great, sharp shots with it. The IS is excellent in both modes. I'm glad it has the zoom lock because without it the lens will flop out. Since buying this lens I have added some L's to my lineup and have gotten a bit spoiled. If I could do it over again, I would buy the 70-200 f/4L IS instead of this lens even though it is white (I hate to stand out). I hate that the 70-300 does not have ring-type USM. It has the micro motor USM that you cannot manual focus unless you flip a switch. If you can swing the price difference and don't mind the shorter focal length, I would recommend getting the 70-200 instead.Update:I just noticed on the description of this lens on Amazon, they claim it has ring-type USM (the better, faster auto focus with full-time manual focus in one shot mode). This is FALSE, it has micro motor USM (slower to auto focus and NO full-time manual focus).""
"20090424","5.0","This Lens is MOSTLY Awesome","Having used both the Canon 70-300 without IS, and the Canon 70-300 WITH IS (this lens), it is ABSOLUTELY worth the extra $400-$450 for this lens. The image stabilization is truly amazing. It allows you get the shot you want from across the room without having to worry about shakiness.Having said that, there are a couple of small negatives to this lens.One, it's a little bit heavy. Not nearly as heavy as the 70-200 f/2.8L IS, but certainly heavier than the 70-300 non IS.Two, there is no manual focus override in auto-focus mode. i.e., you need to flip a switch in order to manual focus. This is probably the most annoying complaint I have. You simply cannot turn the focus ring by hand with auto-focus on.Three, the auto-focus can be pretty slow sometimes. For example, if you are focused on something 5 feet away, and then try to focus on something 60 feet away, it can take as long as 1-2 seconds.Four, this is NOT a macro lens. It says on the lens 'macro,' but that's phooey. It's a blatant misuse of the word. Granted, you can get some pretty nice close-ups, but you're not going to be getting useable pictures of insects.I know I focused more on the negatives than the positives, but that's what you want to hear isn't it? The issues I have with the lens? Overall, it's an absolutely phenomenal lens. It's tremendously fun, and the quality of pictures you can take with it FAR outweighs its inconveniences.""

"20090227","3.0","Disappointed","I'm not particularly thrilled with my 70-300 lens.  It is impossible to get a sharp image with anything less than F8 when shooting at over 100mm.  At F8, I can get reasonably sharp shots and still have a very nice DOF effect.  But still, I can't say that anything I've been shooting has knocked my socks off.  Everything still seems to have a bit of a halo around it.One other oddity is that I cannot seem to use my polarizing filter at all on this.  The results with a filter are always *incredibly* blurry shots - even with manual focus.  Even thru the viewfinder I simply cannot get this lens to focus worth a darn.  I thought it might be the filter, so I tried another one, and same thing:  incredibly blurry shots - completely unusable.  Without the filter things are much better, but still disappointing.The Image Stabilization does work like a charm tho!I had read in another review that the 200mm lens was better and just cropping a high-megapixel image worked better than using this 300mm lens, and I have to agree.  I cannot recommend this lens.""
"20090227","5.0","Excellent Lens","I have owned this lens for 11 months now and I highly recommend it. Its my most used lens and I have taken some really nice photos with it. Here is my take....It handles well on my rebel xti. There is ample space on the barrel to rest it on my left hand and get a nice weight balance, and still turn the big grippy zoom ring. The zoom ring is easy to turn but not loose. Although the focus ring turns during auto-focus its out of reach from my hand. You can reach the IS switches easily by feel without looking. You have to press them a bit to get them to move, but it is impossible to accidently switch them. The AF/MF switch is hard to get to, but I don't MF that much anyway. The build quality is solid and typical of a canon mid-range/non-L lens.AF is fast and accurate. It does have a habit of hunting at 300mm if focus is way off to start with. All other focal lengths are fine. AF noise is very quiet but not silent like my EF 17-40L.The Image stabilization (IS) is excellent!!! If you have good handholding technique you can get blur free (or close enough) still photos to 1/30th second at any focal length. If your hand holding technique is sloppy IS won't help as much. IS really adds to the versatility of this lens.The image quality is great. The images are sharp at any focal length. (I mostly shoot around F4-5.6). The bokeh (quality of the blur) is very smooth, and better than my 50mm 1.8 which can be a bit 'nervous' at times. Colors and contrast are good.I am glad I bought this lens instead of the EF 70-200 F4 L non-IS. The L has better build, and (the consensus is) better image quality. But I have never thought, 'Dang, I wish this lens was sharper or was built better'. But I have thought 'Boy, I'm so glad I have image stabilization right now' and 'I'm glad my lense is less conspicous than the larger white L lense'. I really think that the image quality differences will not be noticed by most people, and can easily be swamped by technique.""
"20090217","5.0","My new favorite","I got the 28-300mm sigma lens a while ago and was unhappy with it. I decided to go the extra $250 and upgrade to this 70-300mm canon lens. I could not be happier. This is a GREAT lens for the money. It is my favorite to use while hiking to get great photos of the wildlife. The lens produces crystal clear images at 300mm. The sigma lens I had is not even comparable to it. Needless to say, I don't know what I would do without this lens now. I should have gotten it sooner.EDIT: I dropped the lens in a puddle (on accident of course) and I was convinced I had lost my best friend. A couple days later, I was brave enough to stick it on my camera and behold! It works! No problems yet and it's been over a week. Canon's stuff has always been GREAT for me in terms of weather and accidental drops. Not to say you should be careless, but accidents happen, and I am impressed by the way the equipment handles it! Especially this lens.Great quality and durability. I LOVE THIS LENS!""
"20090125","4.0","Great lens for the money","I use this lens on my 350D (AKA Digital Rebel XT).  I bought it for 2 reasons:1)My 70-300 Quantaray that works well enough for on my Rebel film camera gives me the infamous 'Error 99' on my digital.2)My daughter's high school graduation was coming up.  The ceremony was to be on the outdoor football fieldI shot nearly 300 frames with this lens at the graduation in very tough lighting.  The distance from the bleachers to the ceremony required every bit of the 300mm focal length much of the time (even with the 1.6X crop factor of the digital rebel).  With the IS I was able to get quite passable images with shutter speeds down to 1/80, although I stayed at 1/125 as much as possible by using higher ISO settings and the largest aperature.  There is no way I would have been able to get decent images handheld at these focal lengths and shutter speeds without an IS lense (especially on a shaky high school bleacher!).Considering the importance of the event, if I'd never found another use for the lens it would have been worth the cost for me.  I have subsequently used it at an air show and a few other events.  I've successfully used the 'Mode 2' on the IS to get some cool motion blue on moving airplanes and cars as well.If I have one complaint about the lens it's the speed (or lack thereof) of the autofocus.  It's a bit sluggish but this isn't a shocker given that this is a consumer product and not professional gear.Anyone purchasing this lens just needs to know what they are buying.  Essentially, you are buying a 200 dollar lens with 400 dollars worth of IS added to it.  One previous poster recommended getting the 70-200 F4L IS instead.  That would be a great purchase aside from the fact that you'd be giving up 100mm of focal length and paying 400-500 more dollars.  I considered that lens (and may get it down the road when I'm 'rich') but this one will meet my (decidedly amateur) needs for quite some time!""

"20081230","4.0","The price is right","Updated 4-20-09Having used it for a few months and comparing it to a 400mm f/5.6L, I still think you get a lot of bang for your bucks for this lens.  Sure it is a little soft and does hunt a bit on AF sometimes, but you are looking at a 500.00 dollars tele zoom, in my opinion, you get more than what you pay for.  Though nowhere sharp near a L lens, it is still quite sharp, pretty good low light performance and very light and compact.  I probably would not used it much for small birds but I will still use this on people and landscape.  Unless you plan to get a L lens in the near future or are birding, you will be very happy with this.Updated 2-18-09After using this for about 2 months, I would still say for the price you pay it is a very good lens.  I have some good pictures from it on birds and birds in flight.  Having said that, it is still kind of on the soft side, but look at the money you are paying for it, you really cannot complain.  I am going to keep this for close range birds in the backyard and indoor/auditorium shoot, but looking to get the 100-400mm 4.5L or 400mm 5.6L for better birds shoot.Updated 1-2-09Do perform the AF Microadjustment, it does make a difference even if you cannot get it spot on.A very good lens for those on a tight budget.  For this price you cannot go wrong.  Do not take the free Tiffen filter, use the credit for a Hoya coated filter.""

"20081120","3.0","Dissapointed","I am a Canon fanatic and own many lenses and this lens is the one that does not give me that happy glowing feeling.  I bought it primarily so when I went to sporting evens I could get closer into the action - I tend to buy seats close rather than sitting at the back of the stands and I am frustrated after a year of ownership.At 300mm the lens is blurry, it seems to produce inconsistent color when I use bursts (1-2 pictures out of ten come up dark.....?) and it can be slow to focus.  I thought I would be able to use this for nature photography however without the predictability of baseball I am not sure I'd be able to snap a birds that might land quickly and dart away again.Its just not up to the quality of my other Canon lenses.  I also think it is shameful that it does not come with a hood considering the price - you can tack on another $40 for that.  When all is said and done you may find something similar from Sigma or one of the other producers that is cheaper and of similar quality.  I personally wish I had gone that route for once.It is not bad ... its just not great.  I'm looking for a replacement.""

I wanted a telephoto; probably more for braggen rights and when I went looking for a telephoto having the 'IS' for Image Stabilizer, something with reach and most importantly looks cool (about 7' long by itself)...well, I had to be realistic about a budget and got this one. As far as quality-hey it's Canon which means pretty good stuff. I rated it at 4 cuz I've not used it yet but for the price? Well, it's either one like this or about a 1000 buck's more. I don't think it's going to see that tick on an elk at 5 miles but it brings those duck's up closer than my point a shoot which seems to always look farther away. Still a bit pricey for us DSL newbies but it's got the all the right stuff for a starter telephoto, in my opinion.""

I use mine with a 30D body and find the combination excellent for shooting outdoor action shots and indoor shots with reasonable lighting.The lens focuses pretty fast and in fairly low light and has provisions for stabilization when panning.This is hard to beat.

I  followed that instructions, and within a little over a week, I had my lens back good as new. The whole process was very simple and straight forward.

"20080623","4.0","Great Canon Lens for Newbies","Let me just say that I'm brand new to DSLRs and this lens just confirmed why I switched from point and shoot digital cameras.  Besides having full control of my photos, the lens is capable of capturing extremely crisp pictures at the maximum resolution and even at low light environment.  I also have shakey hands and with the help of IS 1 and 2, I can now zoom in and capture clear and crisp photos regardless if it's moving or stationary. The Lock feature is another neat idea.  It locks the lens @ 70mm (fully retracted) so you can pull out the lens from your camera bag by holding the front end of the lens preventing it from extending.  The lens is made from high quality plastic and about 60% metal so be prepared for the extra weight specially on extended shoots.I took the lens to its first actual shoot, which is to my son's basketball game a couple of days ago and it performed great with my Canon Rebel XSi.  This lens is neither the cheapest nor the most expensive but it gives you quality photos that you will want to look at over and over.I just have a minor complaint.  There are certain situations when the lens takes a little while to focus.  Sometimes it takes up to 3 times to focus correctly by half depressing the shutter.  This is really not a big deal to me for now.  However, I know time is of the essence to advanced or experienced photographers when you're shooting at fast pace so this might become a bigger issue down the road.  But for now, I extremely happy with this purchase.  So If you are a beginner with DSLRs and have a tight budget, this makes a great starter lens while you dive deep into the expensive world photography.""

This lens does everything well. Zoom, autofocus and IS work very well. Clarity is top notch. This lens would be a steal at twice the cost.Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR Cameras (Camera)Just got it today. Researched this lens, and others, for many weeks. I read all the reviews by consumers and 'experts' and determined that this lens had the least 'negative' reviews in its class. This lens may not be a Canon L lens but at around 1 thousand dollars less it is a steal. I tested this lens on my Canon T3i at all zoom points both indoors and out. The 'IS' works great and is pretty quiet. The 'IS' function switch has two positions, '1' is for shooting still objects and '2' is for panning moving objects. The autofocus is spot on indoors under normal room lighting conditions. The autofocus is also pretty quiet. This lens far exceeded my expectations. This lens is relatively light for this type focal length yet it feels well built. It functions smoothly and is just a pleasure to use. The zoom lock switch is a nice feature. The 200mm & 300mm zoom points were sharp when shooting outdoors at buildings and trees. Some of the bad reviews I read about the 300mm zoom point being soft is not valid. The bricks and mortar lines on buildings were straight and detail was great. The tree branches were sharp as well as the pigeons on them and on the building ledges. I live in downtown Manhattan and face, Freedom Tower, it is still being built and I can see the cranes and steel frame of the building as well as the other buildings being built. The lens has no problem in taking spot on shots of the downtown area.I also bought this lens because it can be used on both full frame and cropped frame Canon cameras. This EF lens is made in Japan and not China.I will provide future updates as to whether its durability under normal use is up to par. Based on what I have already seen, this is 'ounce for ounce' and 'dollar for dollar' one of the best 70-300 IS USM Lenses around.UPDATE: 3/17/2012 - Night time shooting off my terrace was great. Using a tripod I set my Canon T3i manually to ISO 200 @ 1 second shutter speed with 'IS' off. Pictures of lit up buildings in downtown Manhattan came out sharp and no flaring noticed at all focal lengths. Then I took the T3i indoors under normal incandescent lighting and used ISO 400 or 800, depending on zoom lengths, @ 1/10th second shutter speed with 'IS' off & no flash. Pictures again just came out great at all focal zoom points. This is just a wonderful lens. Very happy with it.Will update about durability as time moves on.UPDATE: 3/19/2012 - Today I extensively tested the 'IS' feature. I was able to consistently hand hold this lens at 1/10th , 1/20th and 1/30th second shutter speed at all zoom focal lengths. You indeed need a steady hand and body to do this but the tripod will always give you a slightly sharper picture w/o using 'IS'. Hand held, with the onboard flash, the pictures of course come out sharp. I have no complaints at all about the 'IS'.UPDATE: 3/20/2012 - Today I extensively tested 'Autofocus'. Under normal indoor lighting the auto focus works fine at all zoom points. The auto focus, under conditions where your eyes find it hard to identify the color of objects, starts to bug it out. This however is very normal with any auto focus system on any lens. The system just cannot detect properly the bounce back from an object that does not reflect enough light for the sensor to determine proper distance. If you switch to manual focus and focus on a point your eyes can resolve, you can then snap the shot. Based on 4 days of shooting under outdoor daylight conditions, both sunny & cloudy, the auto focus was accurate. At night, outdoors, I was able to focus on lit up buildings w/o problem. Get this, I was able to use auto focus to take a picture of a single star in a blackened sky. When I looked at it on my LCD I could not believe it. The star looked the same as when I saw it with my own two eyes. I did this by placing the red dot of the central autofocus square directly over the star. It is really fantastic!I will update my post when I have further information to report.UPDATE: 3/21/2012: I have been mostly operating my T3i manually with this long zoom lens as well as other shorter focal length lenses that I have. I find that you can achieve a more life like rendition of the subject that you are photographing in the manual mode. Once you know the lens you are using the easier it is to approximate what settings are best. I look to photograph the subject as the human eye sees it and not as the auto-program thinks you should see it. The T3i, and other DSLR cameras, tend to overexpose the subject by using a higher ISO than necessary. I rather lower shutter speed than raise ISO on none moving subjects. Indoors I look to maintain a 400 to 800 ISO tops. If you cannot maintain this level of ISO, use a flash. When indoors I want the picture to look indoors. If it is night, I want the picture to look as if it is night. I use flash indoors only if I cannot achieve a picture that falls under an ISO of 800. That is my philosophy on taking real life like looking pictures. This lens operates very well manually and it takes great pictures indoors and outdoors.UPDATE: 3/22/2012: I have come to the conclusion that faster & more accurate autofocus can be achieved under poorer lighting conditions when you use only the central autofocus square sensor. Just internally shut down the other peripheral sensors and choose the central red sensor. Then put the red sensor dot on the main subject or object that you want to shoot and the lens will have an easier time focusing. It works for me with this lens, and others, when you shoot under poor lighting conditions. It especially works well when the camera is focusing when using long zoom at 200 & 300mm.Amazon deleted part of my prior post because I copied and pasted the review from Photozone.  I was just trying to be informative and to make sure the consumer knows as much as possible before making an investment in this lens. I can personally tell you it is well worth the cost.""
"20120311","5.0","Great lens but pricing has wild mood swings","This is a great lens that does the average thing really well. For still shots (Weddings, city trips, parks, wildlife (zoos, safaris), some birds (that don't move and are fairly big like over 5-8 inches etc), its a great lens. If you have a great deal of action or movement, you better park it in your bag and whip out a fast lens, like the 70-200, or the 50 mm 1.4 etc. Overall, you won't regret buying this lens because it gives excellent value for the money. Most camera brands have a lens of this sort and range (Nikon, Pentax, Canon to name a few) and they are meant to achieve the average thing and reasonable zoom really well. These are also the cash cows of the lens department. Even professionals use them because they are fun to use and get you good results when the light is good and the subject is at not too great a distance away and time on your side. If you are a pixel junkie and spend a lot of time in front of Lightroom, possibly you have a heavier wallet as well capable of the onslaught of the big guns like the 4,5,6 or 800 mm. For the average to serious hobbyist, this is a great piece of glass.Having raved about the lens, let me tell you it is 90 - 100 dollars less on other sites. I have seen this item on Amazon vary from 575 to upper 400's. I don't understand Amazon's pricing algorithm sometimes.

I found several, several reviews on this lens but they were all in technical terms and leaves you scratching your head a little.  So, if you are like me maybe this review will help you.I bought this lens a couple months ago from US1Photo.com (check these guys out.  They regularly have significant sales and terrific customer service).  I use this lens with a Canon 40D.I take several types and styles of pictures so I needed a lens that would do the best job at several things and have a very affordable price (right at or less than $1,000).  I looked through new, used, third party (Tamron, Sigma, etc) lenses, and read too many reviews and looked at too many images to count, and spent four hours in a photography store playing with lenses before I decided to spend money and take advantage of this lens.  All in all I spent about a week's worth of time in research and testing before I bought this lens.---Edit:Okay, so amazon won't let me put a link here.  This is how you find me.~Go to Flickr~Then type in a '/' then 'photos' then '/' and last type in 'gman_five0'And that should take you there.---Test of comment #1:~The Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM does not track moving objects very well and the farther to the end of the zoom the slower the tracking.(Flickr Gallery page 2)This, I have found, to be completely wrong.  I have used the lens at several sporting events and found that it tracks rather nicely.  I was able to track every step of a base-runner from first base to second, slide, and recovery after the play without losing ONE shot.To see what I am talking about check out my gallery on Flickr.

Also, 'Safe' was used instead of another shot taken at the same time and angle with a 70-200mm IS lens.To take these shots I used 'AI focus' and the 'H' settings on my camera for quicker tracking and the H settings for about 6 frames per second.Test of Comment #2:~The 200-300mm range is nice in theory, but a tack-sharp photo from the 70-200mm f/4L at 200mm is going to look better cropped than a 300mm full-frame photo from this lens.Again, I found this to be wrong.  Though I have no actual 'full sized' picture for this if you comment back with an email address then we can arrange a viewing of one.  Otherwise, take my word for it, I own several lenses and this one stacks up well.(Ref Flickr Gallery)The pictures from the Dance Theater and Tashina were all taken at the 200-300mm focus lengths.  Again, they are not full sized because of photo pirates, but if you email me we can see about full sized shots.Test of Comment #3:~The IS motor is loudI do not know what these people are talking about, but if you call that loud...On the other hand, I have heard (once), the sound of the IS motor, but if you are not listening for it you will not even notice it.Things I have found about the lens:If you spend some time with the lens will be one of your best friends.  It is a great lens especially for people on a budget (like me).  To take the best pictures you cannot just twist it on and go to shooting.  Take the time to LEARN about the lens (change shutter speeds, ISO settings, aperture, white balances, etc) and it will show you where it shines - just like the L series lenses and the 70-200mm IS.This lens has a solid make and feels like it will last forever.  Then again, as you zoom the lens does extend and is plastic.  So, watch out if you are doing sports.  You may get it knocked off.  It did well for me, though.  Extending while zooming makes putting a hood on the lens a bit (very little; so little that you cannot tell) awkward and it looks kinda goofy.I like the lens because it is not as bulky as the 70-200mm lens and it is extremely mobile.  It is as quick as some other lenses, not as quick as some, and quicker than others.  It will give you great quality pictures.  It does have its limits, however: in low light situations not being able to take it back a couple stops and get a wider aperture will not give you the same shot as a 70-200mm.  Then again, like I said, it doesn't drop to that f/2.8 and does not cost all that money.  This has been the single drawback for me about the lens.I use this lens for portraits (Tashina, Samantha), for sports (see gallery), and music (Shawn Pander - See Gallery).  So, it's pretty versatile.  I have yet to use with it flash, but that is because I simply do not like to use flash.  I have yet to use it in a studio setting, but when I do I will amend this review and add a couple of those pictures as well.This lens comes highly recommended from me.  I am not a big time, highly paid, or well known photographer.  I just like to shoot and like what I shoot to be of the best quality that I can have AND afford at the time.  So, if you are like me and cannot spend the needed $1,500 - $1,700 on a 70-200mm IS lens then spend your money on this lens.  You will not be sorry for it.---On another note, comments are welcome.  This is my first ever review on here so let me know if there anything else that you would like to know about and I will do my best to answer the question in the most plain terms as possible.""
"20080417","5.0","AWESOME LENS!","THis is an awesome lens that enables me to get shots that would be impossible to get (hand held) w/out the IS feature. I am VERY picky about sharpness and in the same lighting/conditions, this lens produces images as sharp as my L lens!! I LOVE how light it is and it is quick to focus!  Of course to some people the 'lightness' makes it feel cheap, and I'm sure it may not be as durable as a heavier L lens but I like the ease of carrying it around. I can hand hold at 1/10 a sec (I do have steady hands though) and get a decent shot...of course THOSE aren't tack sharp shots but w/out IS I wouldn't get the shot at all and they are still pretty good.  If you are debating between this lens and the L zoom (70-200mm) I can tell you I use this lens A LOT and I LOVE it, it's light, it focuses quickly (I mostly use manual though), it is capable of VERY sharp images and gives so much low light capability due to the IS...the L 70-200 zoom in this price range doesn't have IS so you won't get as many low light shots and the extra 100mm is great also.  People will tell you that the 'L' zoom crop at 200mm is sharper than a 300mm shot from this lens but i have not seen that to be the case yet.  I am 99.9 % sure that if you buy this lens you will be VERY pleased with it!!!!""
"20080415","3.0","Best lens amoung few choices for my Canon 30D.","I am a quazi professional photographer; meaning I have a small business in which I do commercial photography for several clients, which I started after I retired from my main profession (which was not in photography).My first digital SLR was a Canon 30D and have the wide angle zoom, mid focal zoom and then purchased this zoom.I had been very impressed with the quality of the other two Canon zooms (I had about 30 years experience with Honeywell-Pentex, then Minolta).When I got this zoom it felt 'cheaply made' by comparision. I took some test photos and decided to return it.I then bought the Tamron 70-300 zoom which has AF but not IS, but cost only $125. That lens seemed better built, but when retaking my previous test shots, I found it had some flare at the edges and was not as crisp and clear when enlarged greatly. Those two items would not be a big issue unless you work with large photos or enlarge small sections.The biggest problem was no IS. When shooting anywhere near 300mm, you ended up without a clear photo, unless using a tripod.Soooooo, back went the Tamron and I bought this Canon lens....yes, again.I couldn't see any other choices that include IS AND were much less money, so this seemed my only choice.Bottom line: lens performs well, IS motor is a bit slow and noisey, and it is pricey, but there really isn't any other alternatives.""
"20080412","4.0","Nice lens, a bit heavy and make sure you have an extra battery","I have had this lens now for only a few days but I think it's a great lens overall.  Not quiet 5 stars as you'll see below:Cons:1. I have read that at 300mm (480 on my XTi) that images begin to get a little soft.  I have noticed this too however I think it is sharper than my previous 70-300mm Tamron lens.2. This lens drains batteries faster than any other lens I've had.  I imagine it's because of the IS (even if it's off).  I was having a problem on my XTi when I only had 2 bars left on the battery.  I have the Canon power grip too, so I had 2 batteries in there.  When it was at about 2 (nearly 1 bar I imagine) my Camera would take a picture and even use IS with the lens, but after the shutter opened it would close and the lcd screen on my XTi would not work.  The power light would stay 'on' on the camera even if I turned it off.  I had to remove batteries then I could take one more picture and same thing happend.  I read on message boards about this error, and it seems it's just the draining of the battery, so make sure you have a backup battery! :)3. The lens is a little heavy, not that bad, but if you were going to be walking around all day (which I do); I think alterating hands and lens throughout a day will be okay.4.  Not a 'L' lens.  Image quality will not be quite as sharp but hardly noticable.Pros:1.  Not a 'L' lens.  Yes I know that was a con too, but basically what I mean here is that it's not going to standout like an 'L' lens does (the L lens pro series has a white body instead of black like this one).2.  Compact.  Fits nicely in my Canon backpack.3.  IS.  You can really see the difference at 300mm while looking through the view finder, even before you take the picture.  IS is great!4.  Price!  For a Canon lens I think the price here on Amazon is spot on. Great lens and well worth the price.5.  Image Quality.  I feel this lens is better than my old Tamron lens.Well overall I think this lens deserves a 4.  Great lens.  Oh and go ahead and buy the hood, it's worth it too.""
"20080412","5.0","Canon DSLR Rebel XTI and the EF 70-300 Lens","Canon DSLR Camera and LensI researched various digital cameras when I wanted to step up from my Kodak Easy Share 'point and shoot' digital, which I do still love but wanted to broaden my photo abilities.  I read articles, e-mailed friends, and even stopped people on the street with cameras to ask them the brand name and what they thought about their cameras.  The Canon DSLR Rebel XTI came out ahead of all others, for simplicity in use, dependability of shots, lightweight, and price.  I LOVE my Rebel XTI and it wasn't any time before I just had to order the the EF 70-300mm lens for even more zoom. Even I can't mess up all my photos!  It's a great camera to be able to expand your abilities with interchangeable lenses, etc.  Go for it!""

"20080322","5.0","LOVE this lens!","I just got this lens a week ago and I love it! One of the things the included booklet says about this lens is that it has a 'truly round aperture hole resulting in a nicer background blur.' That is a very true statement! The IS feature is definetly worth the extra money. I have taken a couple hundred shots so far, all handheld, and nothing has come out blurry yet. Awsome lens!""
"20080322","5.0","Not L-quality, but really good at f/8","Don't expect L quality from this lens. The build is not amazingly solid, it extends when zooming or being carried, and the focus is not silent.However, when stopped down to f/8 this lens is great. The IS is amazing. The focus is fast and accurate, and the build quality is good to very good. So for the price it's an excellent buy. Just don't expect miracles, and be willing to tolerate some softness wide-open at 300mm, and having it extend when carried pointing downwards.Update: I recently replaced this with a 70-200 f4 IS L, and the difference is amazing. The L lens is a lot heaver, but enormously smoother, faster, sharper, and better quality. It costs twice as much, but it's significantly better.""
"20080303","4.0","The reason to get this lens is for the IS","I recently used this lens on an impromptu nature walk and was pleasantly surprised at how much the IS helped, especially at the 200-300mm range.  I was able to get some really good long shots--all hand-held--on a relatively low contrast overcast day.  Perhaps it was what I was shooting (relatively still nature, like birds) but I didn't experience any problems that others may have noticed with focus speed or visual quality issues.  I will say this is probably not the lens to use for fast moving sports or even everyday walk-around photos.  For me, telephotos (200mm+) are fairly specialized (I prefer street photography).  In most cases I would use my 28-135mm and crop.  I usually use this lens for very specific purposes.""
"20080302","5.0","This is the 1st lens you want to buy after you got your new Canon camera !","I just received my Canon 70-300mm USM/IS a couple of weeks ago, and I finally got the chance this week end to go out and try it. I was kind of scared after reading the other reviews that I would have issues with the quality of the images at full zoom. Well, let me tell you something, WHAT A GREAT LENS !I was able to take EXCELLENT pictures of my fiancee at a full 300mm settings. After reviewing the pictures on my computer, I was amazed at the details. You can clearly see the smalled strands of hair in the wind. Absolutely amazing.I also took pictures of my dog running on the beach at full 300mm. Some people told me that the focus was kind of slow and I would have issue. It's a little bit slower I agree, but I took great shots of a moving subject. I do not know how good and fast would be the focus in another kind of day (not sunny, low light...) but my first experience with it was great.If you go and look at the customer images link, you will find the one I uploaded (under Simon Templar) and you'll see what I am talking about.The IS is also a great feature. No need to walk with a monopod anymore.Gotta love it !""
"20080224","5.0","TVfuzz","I have shot with the 200L (don't own one) that people are comparing this to.  The lenses are different, and suit different needs.  This lens was what I purchased because I wanted a longer telephoto with IS, instead of the shorter, higher quality non-IS lens.  The thing that most photography reviews often don't take into consideration when talking up one lens over another is price (I'm not picking on any reviewer on this, I'm just saying from experience reading many reviews all over).  To get a theoretical 70-300mm IS USM in an L series, you would pay a TON more than the 200L.  The 200L is obviously shorter and higher quality than the 70-300ISUSM.  If you want to know about the quality and performance of the 70-300mm IS USM, my opinion is that its a strong build with excellent IS.  I'm totally happy with mine, and have taken a few excellent shots at 300mm that turned out great.  I use it in fairly harsh temperatures outdoors.  For the price, you won't find a lens even close that does the same job better.  If you're deciding on what lens to buy, I can't help ya.  But if you're wondering about THIS lens, I say its great.""
"20080218","5.0","EF 70-300 IS lens is great!","Got this lens for my Rebel XTI primarily for sports.  It was a hard decision between this and the 70-200 f4/L lens.  It is a debate everyone has.  After checking with several people who have had both lenses I decided the extra 100mm and the IS was what I needed.  True the 70-200 L lens is a hair sharper but you have to really enlarge the photo to tell.  This lens gets me excellent photos.""

If you want to stick to the quality of the photos, go get more money first!I went on a trip out of country right after I received this order. This lens didn't disappoint me.

"20080202","5.0","I Feel Like a Pro","As an amateur, I shoot a lot at airshows and I have been using a Tamron AF XR Di 28-300mm lens with a Canon SLR Digital Rebel for several years. Most shots are of aircraft from 1/4 to 1 mile away. I don't use a tripod. The Tamron lens is great until you get to full zoom or your trying to get a shot of the P-51 in a high speed pass. The results are ok. Out of 100 shots, 25 might be considered good. With this Canon lens, its image stabilization, and AF almost 75 out of 100 are poster quality. You can count the rivets on the planes! I just can't wait to get to the Sun n' Fun and Oshkosh airshows this year.I realize this lens is not professional grade, but it at least makes me look as if I am a half-decent photographer. The stabilization compensation for my inability to stay perfectly still makes all the difference in the world.Try and take a shot of wildlife or the moon with a non-stabilized lens and then try this one. It is an amazing difference.I was nervous about investing about the same money in a lens as I did the camera, but I have not been disappointed. It was certainly worth the investment and I will be able to use it on my future Canon camera upgrades, too.""

"20080127","4.0","Reasonably sharp pictures - especially for the price","At 300mm, this lens produced much sharper images for me than the EF 100-300mm zoom lens. The image stabilizer (IS) allowed good handheld photos at much slower shutter speeds - had to use 1/800sec previously. With IS, I can now use 1/200sec.Would like to have full time manual focus override but so far only needed it once when the autofocus was temporarily confused because I had not pointed at a contrasty area before pressing the shutter button.Using it on a 1.6 crop factor camera with very satisfactory results.""
"20080124","4.0","A Powerful, Versatile Lens for Consumer Grade Digital SLR Cameras","When purchasing my new Canon EOS 40D I wanted to get an additional lens that would add an extended zoom range from the 28-135mm lens that came in the kit.  I had a budget of $2,500.00 for a digital SLR camera, hot shoe flash, additional lens, memory card, and a large gadget bag.  I wanted to purchase the best quality camera that I could get, so I had decided to purchase the EOS 40D by Canon (kit with 28-135mm lens), but that meant that I would have to sacrifice money spent on the other accessories.  I purchased a 4GB Sandisk Extreme III CompactFlash card, and the Canon Speedlite 580EX II flash with the camera, so that meant I had roughly $675.00 for another lens and a nice camera/gadget bag.  I researched the Canon EF lenses extensively and decided that I had to have a lens with image stabilization.  I wanted a Canon lens and wanted it to have a large zoom range.  All reviews I read pointed to the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens as a solid choice.I ordered this lens from Amazon and got a great price, and with free shipping.  The first thing I noticed is that this lens is lightweight and feels very well made.  The light weight did concern me a little, because I typically process the thought of lightweight electronics gear with cheap build quality.  Well I am convinced that this Canon lens does NOT suffer from cheap build quality.  The lens feel solid, and the focus and zoom rings are not sloppy at all.  The auto focus is fairly fast (although it can be a little slower in the highest zoom range), and the image stabilization works great.  As others have pointed out, this lens produces a somewhat softer looking image above the 200mm range.  However, the contrast and color remains sharp, even at maximum zoom.  If you don't mind giving up some depth of field by adjusting the aperture, you can get very clear images at the full 300mm.My biggest complaints with this lens are as follows:-  The end of the lens rotates when focusing, which causes the constant need to adjust my circular polarizer.-  The zoom changes the length of the lens.-  If you tip the camera at a sharp verticle angle, the zoom adjustment of the lens will retract on its own.-  Auto focus becomes slower at higher zoom setting.-  Having the lens set to AF prevents you from fine tuning the focus manually (there seems to me a mechanical, gear-type lock of the focus ring when AF is engaged)Overall I am extremely happy with this lens, even with the few shortcomings mentioned above.  The auto focus is accurate and fairly fast, the IS feature is rock solid, and the light weight of this lens makes it very good for handheld shots and does not cause balance issues when using a monopod or tripod.  Although I have noticed some minor softness in photos above 200 or 250mm, my pictures always look clear and contain excellent contrast and color.  I'm sure you could get better results from a Canon professional lens, which would cost you well over a grand for this kind of zoom range, but for the average hobby photographer I think this lens is about as good as you can get; and it can be had for under $600.  I am confident that this Canon EF 70-300mm lens will last for many years to come, and I would definately buy it again.  I hesitate to recommend this lens for a professional photographer, but for everyone else it is an excellent choice.""
"20080114","5.0","Great performing lens as a good pricepoint","So, this certainly isn't an L lens, however given the pricepoint and image quality, you can't go wrong.  I've used this lens at a number of motorsports events where the image stabilization is a must have.  Before using this lens, images were blurry and just as many were bad as good.  With the IS turned on, things look great.  Additionally, being able to shoot in lower light has allowed me to take some shots that might have otherwise gotten away.  I'd buy again, though this time I'd add the lens hood to it.""
"20080113","5.0","Great lens","First off, I am not a professional photographer.  I am a newbie with limited digital SLR experience.  The main reason I bought this lens was for landscapes and action photos.  As a landscape lens, it is not good. As an action lens, it is great. When I was in Vermont over Christmas, I took great sledding action photos.  The lens pretty much sucks for any subject less then 20 feet away.  It is good for indoor shots; I used it at my sister's graduation and was able to get great up close shots from about 25 rows back. THIS LENS IS BIG, AND HEAVY.  It is about twice as heavy and bulky as the non-image stabilized 70-300 lens.  It is a great lens, and Amazon had the best legitimate price I could find.""

I also have used it to take outdoor senior pictures of several kids, again with excellent results. It is a bit slow, but shooting at the highest resolution and increasing the ISO does a very good job. IS is amazing, just remember to switch to mode 2 when panning.

I would suggest a monopod for that kind of shooting-not taht the lens is that heavy, it's just a lot of waiting for a few frantic shots.

"20070817","4.0","Looks great on paper...","As a serious amateur photographer and careful research on a decent lens to help get me started, I chose this one. The photo quality and sharpness had me immediately impressed, but after using it for a while now I do start to see its downfalls. It seems to have a serious drop in photo quality as it approaches 300mm, making true telephotography with this lens a challenge. I had read reports on its focusing issues (being too slow, etc) but never really noticed or cared much. After a while using it however, it does start to get a little frustrating and sometimes found myself manually focusing on the object I wanted then switching back to auto to make sure I had it right (and so auto wouldn't search for seconds at a time).That being said, the Image Stabalization does do a great job for low-light. I never found it much use during the daytime and it's currently set to off to help save my battery while I'm on vacation. The photo quality is really tremendous for a beginner, and one will not be upset with it by any means.

The benefits of the Image Stabilization is apparent the first time the shutter is depressed enough to focus this puppy.  I also have the 28-135mm with the IS.  I can't see ever again buying a lens without this feature, even if it means saving just a little while longer to have it.Also, as there was an unexpected delay in shipping (which can happen to any seller), Amazon did me right by adjusting the shipping option to meet the reality.

The IS is awesome, you can actually see the frame stabilize as the IS kicks in.  I tried out the 70-200 but I just couldn't get the shots handheld that I could with the 70-300 IS.  I actually considered the 70-200 IS but once I played with it I thought 'do I really want to lug this around on my travels?'.

So good in fact, that I have posted a few of the images under this lens for you to judge yourself.  Photos that I took at the Atlanta Zoo, under all types of lighting conditions.  The lens produced incredible photos.  All were hand-held shots, most of which were at the full 300mm range.  And the IS is incredible.  I had one photo which was taken in the shade and I was shooting with aperture priority and wide open.  I did not realize how well the IS stabilized my photo till I looked at the exif data on my Flickr site - the shutter speed was 1/10th of a second, hand-held, and at 275mm.

But, for the number of times I need a lens this long, I found it a great choice.  A pro will want faster lens but for many if not most folks, this is a great choice.  The IS is a great feature for a lens this long.I found the image stabilizer noisy, not annoyingly so but clearly louder than my other Canon IS zoom lens, which is perfectly silent.  I took it to Canon and they were also concerned but then they tried some others of the same lens that they had on hand and they were all noisy, so we concluded that that's the way this model is.""

Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 is f/5.6 at 300 mm. I shoot indoor sports a lot, and find that 5.6 is sometimes really not enough, even with IS, even at ISO 1600. When I shoot with sigma at 2.8 (constant aperture throughout the range), i get enough light and can usually have better enlargements because of crisp image quality.i haven't used canon 70-200 4L or 2.8L so i cannot compare (plus they are more expensive), but if i were making a purchase today for my telephoto needs, i would definitely opt for sigma 70-200 2.8, i feel it is worth of its price premium over this canon.""

The 70-300 range is versitle and I have even taken very clear shots of the moon, wildlife and far away scenery. The negatives have to do mostly with its construction: The fully extended lens is very long, especially with the hood. Oh yeah, the hood was an extra $30+ :( ; The barrel wobbles a bit and sometimes it can't autofocus at 300mm. The barrel also rotates when focussing which makes it difficult to use a circular polarizing filter. In spite of these flaws I would recommend the lens as a really good consumer grade product. I use this lens with a Canon close-up lens sometimes to get awsome macro shots. I have a 1.4X teleconverter on the way that will extend its range to 420mm (672mm on the XTi). I will update this review after trying the teleconverter.""

"20070131","2.0","A Solid Lens with drawbacks","This was one of my first lens purchases. I initially enjoyed it however as I became more and more serious about photography I found that this lens was not producing the quality I was looking for. For one, the chromatic abberation at the long end was terrible when the image was viewed at 100%. Secondly, when shooting wide open, the images are soft although stopping down a stop or two corrects this. I ended up trading this lens in towards the purchase of an EF 70-200 f/4L IS USM lens.This lens, however, is not a complete loss. The 3-stop IS is fantastic and the focusing is relatively fast and accurate. I would suggest people just starting out on a tight budget purchase this lens if the higher end lenses are simply out of reach especially if you don't plan on making outlandishly huge prints from your photos. That said, if I had to relive this purchase, I would have held out for a lens with a higher resale value and higher quality.""

I wanted to work without a tripod in most circumstances (soccer games, nature hikes with my son, etc.), and the IS allows me to get great long shots with little loss of quality.  I'm sure the L lenses have great optics, but with the IS, the L lenses would have been WAY too expensive for my needs.The lense searches a bit when using AF, but a minor quibble.

"20061231","4.0","Missing the "wow factor", but still worth it","I own several lenses for my Canon Digital Rebel XTI, and this is honestly not my favorite one.  However, I can't fault the overall performance of this piece, and I would recommend it being aware of its limitations.PROS- Excellent build construction.  The case is metal and appears quite solid even when extended.- 300mm at a reasonable cost.  Combine that with the 1.6 magnification of the common half-frame sensors found in many digital cameras, and that equates to some serious zoom.- Fairly short focal length: this is definitely a telephoto, but if you want to take portraits with it, you can get within 5' or so of the subject, even at more than 70mm.- Image Stablization: invaluable.  I rarely get a blurry shot; recently I compared this lens with and without a tripod and could not notice a difference.  Of course, low shutter speeds will greatly impact this feature, but it is still a must.CONS- I'm not impressed with the clarity of most pictures.  The AF is quick and reliable, but it often feels like something is 'missing'.  Pictures are not out of focus but sometimes feel excessively 'soft'.- Weight: if you are going to walk around a park or nature trail all day, figure a creative way to carry this thing.  Not a 'con' per se, but definitely a consideration.- Color just feels lackluster sometimes.I think this is a decent lens which requires careful attention to lighting and camera settings to take a truly good picture; it's less forgiving than the other lenses I use (mainly a Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II & Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-4.6).""
"20061225","5.0","A note for beginners...","I got this lense as a Christmas gift for my Digital Rebel (so I haven't had it very long) but I was absolutely blown away.  When I was looking to upgrade to a lense with a larger range (from the original 18-55 mm lense that you pretty much get with the camera), I read through most of the reviews and compared prices between the different lenses.  I wasn't sure if getting the IS was worth the significant extra money over the other lenses offered, but decided it was worth a shot.  On my first picture, I zoomed all the way in with the IS turned off and noticed a large amount of shaking just from me trying to hold the camera still.  Then I flipped the IS on and decided right then that it was worth the money.  I can't believe how well the IS works...The only thing I wasn't really expecting was the weight of the lense.  I don't have much experience with others like this, so I don't really know how it compares, but I realized it was much heavier than I was expecting.  The only other disadvantage is that it sucks battery power like there is no tomorrow.  My next step will be investing in a higher mAh battery... and now a bigger camera bag to hold this monster.""

"20060801","5.0","Fast AF, Excellent IS, good sharpness","I bought this lens to replace an EF 100-300mm (USM) that we had from my wife's film shooting days (not a common lens to have, apparently; the 75-300mm seems to be more widespread).  That older lens produced some surprisingly good pictures (quite sharp), but handheld shots were hard to get right at long focal lengths.The image stabilization feature of this lens works remarkably well, but it's quite a bit noisier than that of the EF-S 17-85mm IS (my first IS lens; you hardly hear the IS gyrations at all on that one).  The sharpness is quite good (probably a tad better than that of the EF 100-300mm, although it's not a foremost strength of this lens in my opinion). I was surprised by how much faster I can acquire focus with this lens, even though reviews suggested that it still falls short of L-series lenses (see e.g. the 'flying gull' shot I uploaded to the 'customer images' set).If you want to shoot hand-held at 150mm+, I don't think this lens has much competition under $1000 for Canon EOS users.""

This is a powerful lens, yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use.  I was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds, zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (Canon EOS 20D) and virtually every shot was a keeper.  The IS feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus.  Usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one.  I shot in both portrait and landscape mode and I didn't see any problems with focus, clarity or sharpness.  All the images were clean and razor sharp.  If you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment, I highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.""

I put the movie mode on my T2i and you can really see the amount of shake the IS takes out of the image.  Very impressive.  Only negative I can give this lense is that the IS mechanism was audible.  You really notice when it's working with a slight hum from the lense.  You don't hear it out and about, but in a quite room it took me a while to figure out where that new noise was coming from.

"20120129","5.0","Beats My 55-250","I debated a long time before buying this lens.  I already had the Canon 55-250 and was getting pretty good shots, however, I wanted more reach.  The 400L and 600L were way out of my pricerange so my options were stick with the 55-250 or get this lens.  I did a google search re comparing this lens with the 55-250 and got lots of threads on photo forums where this was discussed.  Most comments indicated if you already had the 55-250 it was foolish to spend $400 to get the additional 50 since you could gain the same by walking a few steps closer to your subject.But walking closer is not always an option.  I enjoy photographing kiteboarders and surfers in action and walking a few steps closer means being up to my waste in water.  Likewise shooting other types of sports action you can't walk onto the playing area in order to get closer to the subjects.So I bought this lens and am very glad I did.  Now the subjects come closer to filling the frame and the photos are clearer and sharper than those taken with my 55-250.Yesterday I had an experience that would have convinced me I made a wise decision if I had any doubts.  When shooting kiteboarders I normally shoot Tv at 1/1000 because they are moving so fast and I don't want blurring.  Yesterday the wind was very good and the kiteboarders were going airborne.  I had a field day and was certain I had lots of good shots.  Until just before leaving I noticed that I was in P and had been shooting at a slower speed.  I felt almost physically sick thinking about all the good shots that I'd messed up by forgetting to switch to Tv 1/1000.  Staying and taking more was not an option because the wind had died down and the best kiteboarders had come ashore.What a wonderful surprise to upload those photos to my computer and find that even though shot between 1/395 and 1/512, more than I would have expected based on my experience with the 55-250 were keepers.  1/1000 would have been better, but the photos were sharper than had I been shooting with the 55-250 and because I was shooting RAW and the blurring was minimal, I could correct for much of what there was in post processing.This lens is definitely sharper than my 55-250.  I have confirmed this many times over as I pull together photos of kiteboarders to make a kiteboard gallery.  The photos taken with both lenses are good, but those taken with this lens are a little sharper, a little clearer, and require less post processing.And the subjects fill more of the frame, the  desire for which was a major reason for buying the lens.I like to have a hood on my lenses to prevent possible flare, however, because this lens is long I decided against the plastic-type hood I have on other lenses.  Instead, I purchased a rubber lens that you can collapse.  It is not as deep as the plastic hood for this lens so doesn't make the lens appear excessively long when in use, and because it collapses it takes up less space in the camera bag.Finally, I'm using the lens on a Canon T2i, which is smaller than most of the other Canon SLRs.  However, I have a battery pack, which makes the camera larger and provides more places to hold it.  If it were not for the battery pack, I believe this lens would be difficult to manage on the T2i because of its length and weight; the weight is about the same as the camera without the battery pack.  It is noticeably longer and heavier than the 55-250, which is a better size for the camera without a battery pack.  So if you are thinking of using this lens on a T2i, I suggest you also consider getting a battery pack so that the lens is attached to a larger, heavier camera than is the case without the battery pack.""
"20120109","4.0","Great lens for price!","I've owned this lens for more than a year now and have had great results from using it with my EOS T2i. Of course this lens is not the build or glass quality of an 'L' series Canon lens, but it does take great photos in good light. I use it mostly to take photos of critters in nature, especially dragonflies and it generally results in sharp crisp images. I have used it on birds as well with not as much success. I recently acquired the EF 100-400 L lens and when comparing the two, it is obvious that this lens doesn't come anywhere close to the L lens but for nearly $1000.00 less that is to be expected.""
"20120102","4.0","Great Lens with minor issues","I have owned this lens for about 2 years and have taken close to 5000 photos with it. At best, I consider myself an `advanced amateur' that spends 95% of the time taking landscape or wildlife pics. I use this lens on a 50D. I love photography but unfortunately at this stage of my life I cannot afford the 'L' quality lenses that so many of us can only dream of. Maybe one day. This lens fit nicely into my budget and I was pleasantly surprised at the optical quality.Pros:* Pictures are very sharp* The image stabilization is great. I have consistently handheld at 1/30 second when shooting at full zoom and the pics still came out sharp (most of the time). Even lucked up at 1/15 second occasionally.* Affordable* Built solid* Love the fact that you can lock the zoom down at 70mm when in transportCons:* At times I have had issues with the focus not wanting to lock in when the lens is at full zoom and wide open. It doesn't happen often but can be aggravating when it does.* The focusing time seems slower than any other lens I have.Overall I love this lens and for the money it is a great buy. The focusing issue is relatively minor and would not keep me from recommending this lens to anyone.""

Fast focusing and great image stabilization (IS does use quite a bit more power, though).  Have not had one problem with it. Solid build and has a little heft to it.  It is a bit pricey, but I chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens.""
"20060511","5.0","Superior Image Stabilizer Telephoto Zoom from Canon","The Canon EF 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM telephoto zoom lens replaces the first Image Stabilizer lens of its kind, the Canon 75-300mm f4-5.6 telephoto zoom lens. It offers now up to three - as opposed to two - apertures in image stabilizing mode, as well as slightly wider focal length. The current June 2006 Popular Photography issue has a fine test report on this lens, showing that it is capable of excellent contrast and resolution in the range from 70mm to 200mm; at 300mm, both contrast and resolution decline slightly to very good, but still an excellent result for a zoom lens in this class. It is also fully compatible with Canon's digital SLR cameras (112-480mm equivalent), with improved lens coatings optimised for digital sensors. Without question this is an excellent lens for the Canon photographer interested in excellent nature and landscape photography, without resorting to a sturdy tripod to hold both the camera and lens; thus it is also quite suitable for handhold panning shots at most outdoor sporting events held under good weather conditions.""
"20060428","4.0","There are Better, but There are More Worse","This is a good zoo lens.  It is not as heavy or noticeable as something like the 100-400 L lens.  Also, with the 3 stop IS and smaller size and weight this makes a great backup lens to the 100-400 on trips or when I just don't feel like carrying around a 3+ pound lens all day.  So if you don't want to have to deal with the cost or size of an L series lens this is one of the next best options.""
"20060321","5.0","Quite happy with the lens","After debating between this and the 70-200 L series I decided to purchase this lens.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the results.  I also own the 17-85 and the 50mm 1.8 lenses and I have found that I have gotten the 'most pleasing' results from this lens.  The pictures have been very sharp from my 20D - even in the 200mm - 300mm range.  I've also been happy with the quality of the bokeh.The primary drawback I see is that the AF tends to hunt a fair amount when confronted with low contrast images.  That being said, I used it for some flying bird shooting at the wildlife refuge and was surprised to see how many of the shots were in sharp focus.  However, it was a little bit of all or nothing.  Several shots were also wildly out of focus.  Since the lens is fairly slow to focus, you never know what you're gonna get with such a fast moving object against the distant sky.I had much more consistent results when shooting soccer, softball and football in the park.  The AF speed did not present an issue for any of these activities and the results were excellent.I wish the lens were a little less expensive but I the prints I have gotten from my 13 X 19 printer have been worth the extra money.""
"20060316","5.0","Canon Lenses","This Canon Lens upholds the tradition of fine products from the Canon line of photographic accessories. It takes very clear, sharp, hand held pictures with the Image Stabilizer capability activated. It negates the necessity of carrying a tripod every time one wants to take long telephoto shots.

The lens is a little slow but the IS allows you to take at 2-3 stops than normal for static subjects.  If I would rate it with 10 being best, optical quality is 8, focus speed 8, construction is 7 because of zoom creep and loud IS, price 9.""
"20060218","4.0","Nice Lens","This lens does everything it should very well. Really allows you to take a close look at something with great image quality.

However, as long as you plan for it and the conditions are constant, you can work around it. All in all this is a nice lens.""
"20060111","4.0",""The hidden L lens..."","I bought this lens about a month ago when I purchased my Rebel XT.I was initially dissapointed by the image quality but it turned out that I actually had a bad filter on the lens. Once I removed that cheap filter the lans came to life and has blown me away!!If you read some of the forums there are actually Canon owners complaining that this lens is too good and has effectively devalued their expensive 'L' lenses!The only negative thing that I can say about this lens is that the front element rotates while focusing, making using a circular polarizer somewhat cumbersome. The Image Stabilizer really is a technological marvel though and will leave you wondering why every lens doesn't come with it (the answer is that it adds to the weight and IS isn't cheap).This weekend was the first time the weather cooperated enough for me to try it outdoors. I went to a small local zoo and took a picture of a red fox from about 30ft away... through 2 wire fences... in sub-par lighting. I didn't expect much. The picture actually came out and is so sharp I am having it framed.Buy this lens!""
"20060109","4.0","so far so good","I have just bought the lens and took some trial pictures1- the Auto focus is not great at 300mm.2- it is impossible to take sharp pictures at night using image stabilizer at 300mm, however, between 70-160mm IS works great at night and to me, it is good enough.3- regarding the construction, it looks little bit cheap comparing the L models.4- the images taken under day light are really sharp even at 300mm.I would strongly recommend this lens if you do not mind the negatives I wrote down above.""

It is currently my favorite carry-around lens. Adequate for birding and pseudo macro functions. Not a bad portrait lens. All of this is in the context of use with a 20D and Rebel. It is a full-frame 35 mm lens.Cons:  The lens face rotates with focus, so use of a circular polarizer is problematic. You choose MF or AF, but not both at the same time like the 100-400 L-Series.Pros:  Huge improvement on older 75-300. IS is excellent! Much more subtle in use than a white L lensCons:  No ftm. Front element rotationif your a newbie here's some infoA lens is 'fast' when it has a low f-stop... ok so when you have a smaller number the apature is bigger which allows more light through, so this means you can up the shutter speed. and still have enough light reach the sensor.ok so lets say you have an out door shot if you have say an f/4 lens the shutter speed could be 1/250 of a second and you would get a good exposer. Now this lens can only go f/4but if you in the same outdoor setting, had an f/2.8 lens you could jump to 1/500 of a second and get the same exposer. and freeze the action mmore effectivly, this i believe is why it's a 'fast' lens.ok have fun and get it done""
"20051108","5.0","Impressive lens","I bought this lens as a replacement for the earlier 75-300mm IS lens.  I was generally happy with that lens, but it had definite limitations - I needed to shoot at f8 or f11 and bump up the ISO to get a decent shutter speed.This new version seems sharp at full zoom even wide open, allowing me to use a lower ISO setting.  Size is similar to older version, but the IS seems more effective - looking through the lens when it kicks in you can actually see the image become more stable and less shaky.  I got this over the Canon 70-200 f4 L because of the extra reach, smaller size (slightly) and the images I've seen from both are very similar.UPDATE:  There have been reports of soft images when using this lens in a verticle orientation - however I have not experienced this on my copy.

I never realized how pathetic third party lenses were in the AutoFocus department until I purchased one. The AF speed and accuracy are worlds apart. Reviews say the AF stops working when using a 1.4x adapter. Ummm, they got that wrong. The AF works just fine. Take off the 1.4 and you're good for shooting in a dimly lit church.

The previous lens that I had just wasn't long enough, so after reading through all of the reviews here and elsewhere, I got this lens.  I love it.  Plain and simple.  I have had no problems with it.  I have used it at all focal lengths and have seen no problems with softness at 300mm, but maybe that's because I'm not taking pictures of charts and then zooming in on the corners of the picture and looking for problems.  When I first got it, I tried it out in the quiet early morning hours in my house and the IS did seem a little noisy.  I checked this out on the internet and from what I read it seemed normal.

I came pretty close to getting an L lens and decided on this because I want to purchase others items for my fun bag. I didn't want to go with any of the other cheap ones made by other brands. I have a relative that has a 75-300mm and thought it was OK but it didn't have IS. I didn't buy this for the IS and was in for a big surprise at how well it works. It is a bit noisy when active but I can live with that considering how much shake it really takes out on setting 1! I haven't tried 2 yet.I was kind of bummed that it didn't come with a hood though (I knew this beforehand). So you might consider purchasing the hood along with this. I've had a bit of an issue with the focus ring while zoomed all the way out. I hold the barrel while shooting and have ,on occasion, had the hood ruin a shot or two because it rotates when you focus. It was resting on my hand or moved a leaf in my field of view while shooting birds. Not enough to take any stars away though. I just need to be aware that the barrel extends and rotates when zooming or focusing. I'm very pleased with this purchase.""
"20111009","5.0","A must have","I have to admit that after reading several negative reviews on here, I had actually passed on this lens and was going to save up to buy the 70-200 f/4 instead. To my surprise, I was actually able to pick up this 70-300 for just $50 at an estate sale, which was an absolute steal. After using this lens extensively with my T3i, I have to say that I don't see any reasons why anyone would need to spend more on the 70-200 f/4. The pictures you can achieve with this lens are remarkable, and the IS is incredible for handheld night time shots. Even when cropped in, you really don't lose much detail. I would have no problems buying this lens at full price knowing what I know now if I didn't already own this lens. I guess the pictures some people get with the 70-200 f/4 must be out of this world, because I really can't imagine getting any better than what you can get with this lens. I definitely plan to take this with me, along with my Tamron 17-50 f/2.8 when i leave for France later this month. I have a feeling that I will be coming back with some amazing photographs.""
"20111003","4.0","Good for Pictures, Not so good for Video","Ok, let me start off by saying that I do both video and photo work at weddings and birthdays and other events. I do this professionally, but only started with doing it within the last year.PhotographyThis lens is pretty much what you expect when taking pictures. Not the best, but not the worst at all. It is great at events for taking candid close up shots of guests. The 5.6 aperture, if taking pictures at a poorly lit area at night is a little difficult if you do not normally work with your own lighting equipment. But this review is about the product itself, and it has the aperture and focal length stated on the box. So you pretty much get what you expect. With that in mind, it is a good starter lens and gets the job done.VideographyI also shoot a lot of DSLR video professionally and as a hobby. This lens, is not so great for video. It has a really loud and distinct motor noise that is very annoying and makes the lens seem pretty cheap. Fortunately most of the video I shoot has music on top of it, and I also have two other sources of external audio recording. If not for the separate audio recording, this lens would make it impossible to film with. The video quality is good, but the motor noise makes it impossible to shoot both audio and video with it.OverallGood starter lens. Good for photo, not so great for video.

I've recently gotten some lens filters which will improve the photo quality even more. I highly recommend this zoom lens for my fellow amateur photographers.""
"20110916","3.0","It's OK...","When my EOS 10D died a month ago I decided to buy the 60D and wanted a longer focal length and IS lens than the 28-200mm USM I've used over the past 8 years.  I really wanted the EF 100-400mm L 4-5.6 IS USM but the $1600 price tag was a bit rich.  I'd test driven both this lens and the 100-400 in the past and really thought I would be OK settling for this one.  I was wrong.  Not that this is a bad lens, far from it, it's a very good lens, especially considering the sub $500 price tag.  For the money it's great, it just didn't give me a whole lot more than the 28-200 I already owned nor the 400mm (640mm on the 60D) I desired.The Pros:  Great telephoto-zoom for under $500.  Good clarity in well-lit situations.  Lightweight. An excellent prosumer grade, 2nd lens if you're looking to add to the kit lens that comes with a your Rebel or D series.  The Image Stabilization works very well and allows you to shoot quick moving objects at reduced shutter speeds.  I shoot a lot of aviation photography and if you shoot fast shutter speeds on propeller aircraft, you end up 'stopping' the propeller and it looks like the aircraft isn't moving.  With IS on in Mode 2m you get the nice full-motion propeller circle while freezing the detail of the aircraft's fuselage.Cons: Slow and noisy focus.  In lower light situations, even cloudy days, this lens' shortcomings are magnified.  Things get grainy on cloudy days.  Even in bright sunlight I found myself pushing the brightness compensation in my 60D up a few notches to get acceptable results, even with the 60D's lens illumination compensation on.  I feel the 58mm barrel diameter just doesn't allow enough light in.  The construction is ABS which makes the lens light but not sturdy feeling.  I worry it wont absorb 'rugged use'.  Autofocus is slow, noticeably slower than my EF 28-200 USM (non IS).The bottom line:  I went to my credit union, borrowed the $1600 and purchased the 100-400 L and will be returning this one.  It is a GREAT 2nd lens but when I had the EF-S 18-135 IS which came with my camera & the 28-200 USM from my previous rig, this lens just didn't give me much more than I already had.""
"20110911","5.0","The first lens you should buy in the telephoto range.","This lens to me is the only lens I would recommend without hesitation. My results for this lens have been better than any other lens, and I consistently get what I want.One of the features that is not often mentioned is the two IS modes.  If you are tracking moving subjects, switch to mode 2.  Then check to make sure your shutter speed is at least a 400th of a second.  You might want to go much higher, say one 2000th of a second.  Sacrificing ISO and going to 200 or 400 will not affect your quality. Shoot away and take lots of images!  Note that even at 1/400th of a second you will be almost stopping quick moving objects, and sometimes a little motion blur adds to the feel of the image.Note that it is an EF lens, so you can upgrade to full format.""
"20110827","2.0","Not the lens you expect from Canon","Here's why I give this such a low rating - the IS motor sounds like a cheese grater in the lens.  Now, I might not make a big deal about this if the kit lens on my 60D made ANY SOUND AT ALL - but it doesn't - it's silent.  NO WAY should a lens like this be THAT loud.  A click here or a light buzz there is fine - this is way beyond that.So I headed off to a local camera store after the grinding sounds to try some of these lenses in this class:At a local camera store I shot this one, the 70-300 Tamron and the 70-200 f4 L all on my 60D.To be honest - the Tamron is pretty damn close to the 70-200L in sharpness - but the L is a faster focus for sure.Point being - this lens wasn't even competing...  the images were NOT of the same quality as the Tam or the L - they were just blah.  Guys at the camera store said the same things about the shots, saw the same issues I saw.So - for those of you who are happy with this lens - great.  I found the IS morot noise to be unbelievable and unacceptable...  I don't want people looking at me thinking my camera is dead when it's just stabilizing an image...  I went with the Tamron 70-300mm from the local store and LOVE the results on the 60D (the lens correction profiles in the 60D recognize the 70-300mm Tamron).  Guess that's why they make so many - to each his own.P.S. - this lens at the camera store was also way too loud in IS mode.""

It performed quite well; very intuitive, easy to handle, and easy to swap between my standard lens and this one on my Rebel T-2.  Managed to get some good shots of grizzlies and a black bear, as well as bison, etc. At times I wished I had gone with a longer lens, the bighorn sheep were quite a distance off, so a longer (and more expensive) lens would have been helpful. But, for general purpose, and portability (which was one of my main criteria), I was more than satisfied. The optics are clear and focusing precise.It would be nice if they offered a hard case for the lens; my old Tamron telezoom had a nice hardened foam lined  leather case; alas I could not find one for this so I substituted a Tamrac,nylon and foam case that worked adequately.""

You need to be about 5-6 feet away from your subject to take a picture but the results are excellent. I have noticed some of my photos were a little soft if the light was not good and I was shooting at F11 or higher. With good light I have had some excellent results and have been able to take hand held shots that I would have missed with my other lens.Overall I have been very pleased with this lens so far.

Hopefully this review can give you that last push to finally pull the trigger.After buying a Canon 5D Mark II with a 24-70L lens, I realized that my needs for a lens with extensive reach was necessary during nature trips, graduation events, etc. Knowing that my next purchase of a telephoto lens usage was seldom as compared to my primary 24-70L lens, I was bit more frugal regarding $ value but image quality was still my utmost priority. I set out on a journey to a local photography store to borrow a 70-200 F/4 IS USM (~ $1250) and 70-300 F/4-5.6 ($500) which only costed me $40 :) Though they had my credit card on file incase of scratches or loss :(. Notice that my reviews are primarily focused on lenses with IS since my hands are not the steadiest.After going to an airplane show and local mountain, I took many pictures of flying airplanes (little redundant but just to illustrate that they weren't inactive!) to landscape portraits. When I compared the pictures from both lens down to the pixel, I realized image quality was VERY VERY similar. Of course you'll have differences in terms of minor distortion, vignetting, resolution and chromatic aberrations from the 70-300 lens but it was so minor that you'll never notice it without zooming in. This is where the power of the 'L' comes in, but only to an extent. Pictures printed up to 8x10 were fine, but any larger the minor flaws of the 70-300 became indisputable.There are many claims that the AF on the 70-300 is rather poor especially on maximum 300 zoom--AF was able to capture almost all my airplane photos 7 out of 10 attempts whereas the 70-200 was right on the dot 10/10 which wasn't a big problem for me considering the image quality was still up to par. Also I must note that the 70-300 was able to retain a great amount of detail just like the 70-200. This is not a subjective con but rather raw proof that this lens can perform just as great! My only itch with the 70-300 is obviously the narrow aperture will perform poorly in low lit areas which inevitably increases ISO and slowing down shutter speed which may result in blur or 'noise'. Also please note that the 70-300 does NOT come with a lens hood whereas the 70-200 does. Weight is not a problem since they are both about ~ 1.5 lbs.As I have mentioned before, it all comes down to YOUR needs, so:BUY THE 70-300 F4-5.6 IS USM - if you don't mind the wide aperture F5.6 on far zoom which also means the majority of your pictures will be taken under well-lit areas, need the longer focal length range (which comes handy especially if your trying to catch a bird), MUCH less expensive which is by a non trivial margin from the 70-200 F/4 IS (~1200) and offers just as great image quality!BUY THE 70-200 F4 IS USM - if need a constant aperture size at all focal lengths which can translates to faster shutter speeds/low ISO at long focal lengths, compatibility with 1.4x and 2.0x teleconverters which can potentially extend your focal lengths to 400mm!, enlarging your pictures past 8x10 while retaining phenomenal image quality and detail, shooting sports needing faster reliable AF.BUY THE 70-200 F2.8 IS USM (aka King of telephoto lens) - if your sick and tired of reading review after review and just want the best of the best, have at least $2400 to spare from your piggie bank (which is the same price as a Canon 5D Mark II body!), wedding photographer, basically same specs as 70-200 F4 except for F2.8.Given my needs and my seldom usage of this 'secondary' lens, I bought the 70-300 IS USM along with a B+W 58 multi-coated uv filter (a must!). I've been scolded at by some colleagues for placing this lens on a pro grade camera Canon 5D Mark II, but after performing many tests, the image quality of the 70-300 IMHO is just as good. Surprisingly, this was initially a recommendation from my photography professor at ucla.I hope this helps! Good luck!""
"20110817","3.0","Fair lens","This lens is fair for what you pay for it but don't expect anywhere near L quality in sharpness, contrast and saturation of colors. As a beginning lens it is useful and the image stabilizer works well. This lens is part of an older generation of lenses designed to compliment the wide angle kit lenses.""

"20110722","1.0","Auto focus not good","Liked the lens at first but after looking closer at pictures that were taken at shorter distances they were very good, but when taking distance shots they were blurry. I switched to manual focus and the pictures were much better. I tried different settings on the camera with no luck. Returned lens and purchased the canon 70-200 L 4.0, so far much much better, it's the lens I wanted all along but the cost held me back. Save your money and buy what u want.""
"20110701","5.0","Excellent lens!","I really LOVE this lens. Great value for money. It is a little heavy when on camera. If you are walking around a lot it will make your neck sore with just the camera strap. Installed on a T2i Canon and works GREAT! Very easy to use and takes great pictures. I'm a novice camera user, but take some great pictures thanks to the quality products Canon puts out!""
"20110628","5.0","Perfect upgrade form 75-300 f4-5.6 III","This lens produces incredibly sharp pictures from Wide angle all the way up to lower 200s. After which, the image starts softening. But, you probably already know this. If you are trying to decide between this lens and the 70-200 f4L, the decision is simple - If you are a big time tripod user, get the L lens, if not, buy this. The IS in this lens is awesome, although, it makes a crackling noise, which can sometimes be annoying, especially if you are unaware of it. It can even make you think there's something wrong with the lens. Just be aware of the noise, and you'll soon get used to it.""
"20110621","5.0","Canon EF 70-300","I was very pleased with this purchase. I use this lense as much if not more than my others, with taking pictures of nature, family and around our farm. Its easy to use, operate and understand. I take beautiful pictures of our Elk, the sunrises and of the kids during sporting activities. I use my Canon all the time, and usually you don't see me without it, and I am trying to add many lenses for multiple purposes. I also purchased the 50mm for close-ups of flowers bird nests, etc. would highly recommend this purchase to anyone.""

"20110612","5.0","Great lens for price!","For the most part, couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Only real issue is with using the auto-focus to track rapidly moving targets at events like an airshow.  At long focal lengths, it is occasionally a bit tough to keep the focus dot on the aircraft and then  the lens will basically focus on the infinite sky background instead of on the airplane.  This cost me a few shots, but I still got a number of good ones that I really like.  I have an older Canon Digital Rebel and the camera/lens combo produces great shots, with crisp colors, both indoors and outside.  Definitely glad I went with the Canon lens and not one from a third-party manufacturer.""
"20110606","5.0","Good Value IS USM Lens","IS for 300mm is a good MUST-HAVE feature, and this Canon lens is not too pricey! Sure, the 'L' lens will give better image quality but they are so much more expensive.Compared this with Tamron and Sigma, and given the slightly (rather than much more) price difference, went ahead to buy this.Am happy and no regrets! Strongly recommend this Canon lens.""
"20110602","4.0","Good but Soft at 300mm","It is a good buy for the money; however, the lens does go soft at 300mm. It is much better at 70mm and 200mm. The softness in my lens was not apparent until I magnified the image on my 60D. I was shooting some picures of a hawk (who turned out to be a very cooperative model, by the way), and when I magnified the picture to check to see if I had gotten the eyes sharp, I could see that the eyes were not tack sharp. I mounted the camera on a tripod, used a cable release, and the sharpness improved but still was not tack sharp. I decided to shoot the brick wall on my house at 70mm, 200mm and 300mm with the camera mounted on a tripod and again using a cable release. Again, I magnified the image as high as it would go and checked it. At 70mm the picture was very sharp. At 200mm it was slightly less sharp but still excellent. At 300mm though the picture was quite soft. Is this a fair test? Yes and no. With my Canon 100mm macro lens I used live view magnified to focus on the stamen of a flower, and the picture was tack sharp even at the highest magnification, so the act of magnifying the picture, in and of itself, is a fair test of a lens. But, of course, the 70-300mm is not a macro lens and can't be expected to perform like one. And, in fairness, most of the zoom lenses that I see reviewed also show some degree of softness at the longest setting. So, in conclusion, buy the lens but if you see softness at the long end don't be surprised. (P.S. Prior to my experience here, the lens had been thoroughly overhauled by Canon as part of a recall program.)""
"20110519","4.0","Nice lens, but give and take.","I will not get into all the specs. on this lense becuase there are plenty of reviews with peoples experiences on them. If you are new to the lens world and are considering a zoom lens for capturing your childrens moments then this review might give you some insight in helping you decide if this is the lens for you. This review is not really about the lens itself but to help if the zoom range of 70-300mm is something that will work for you. So we don't need the camera geeks out there ranting and raving about how this has nothing to do about the lens itself.I use this lens for my childrens performances indoors and activites outside. The motor is built into the lens so it focuses real fast and is pretty sharp, but you will still get some shots that are soft. This lens has image stabilization that works pretty well and also a second stabilizing setting for following objects in motion when you pan the camera. I caught some good sharp pictures of my kid running to third base on this setting and I was snapping away and panning. Try this with a regular lens and you might only get a shot or two. This lens works well in low lighting also which is a plus because your flash won't reach the distance where this lens can cover. With all these features built into the lens, it is a little on the heavy side to hang on your neck for long periods of time.Now to get to the gives and takes. This lens is fast enough to focus and capture your shot with different stabilizing modes. The downside is this lens is long and heavy. Not exactly something you want to carry around on vacation or in a crowded environment. Another downside is that this lens is 70-300mm. You still have to carry another lens to cover the shorter distances less than 70mm if you are planning on taking close pictures. It is either step back far away (if you have the room) or switch lenses. So if you carry two lenses and have to swap them out which can be tricky if you are in a hurry and pulling them out, fumbling with caps, worrying about not to drop them, dust and putting them away.You might want to look into two other options Canon offers like the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS and the EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS or some other brand.The EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS is smaller but does not have the built motor so it focuses a little slower. You might miss your shot. But you have your close range covered and a decent distance reach. Good enough in my opinion for like small gyms, weddings, parties, kids playing in a park, etc. But limited in reaching out into a playfield and your sitting in the stands or in an auditorium and your not sitting in the good seats.The other option from Canon is the EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS. Now this lens should be able to cover all your needs. It is a wide angle which is nice to get everyone into the shot if you don't have room to back up. But with a wide angle zoom your shot of let's say a building will not be as close as a normal lens. The reason is because the wider lens is capturing a more wider horizontal view rather than a taller vertical view. So vice versa with a normal lens that will capture a larger vertical view rather than a larger wider view. So give and take. I think that this lense will be the most versatile of them all because you only have to carry one lens and it is a little more compact. You have all your ranges covered. The jump in zoom from 135mm to 200mm and 200mm to 300mm is not that major. The 200mm falls in about the middle of the 135mm and 300mm so I think it is a good median. Compare them in a store and you will see. And depending on how good your shots turn out and the quality of it, you can always crop to compensate to some degree. There are other cheaper after market lenses out there without out image stabilzation but if you zoom out far then you need it. If you do all your shots on a tripod then not so important.I am looking into getting the 18-200mm lens. I don't use my SLR as often as I like because of the bulk, carrying extra lenses, hassle, and worries. With an 18mm range on up lens you will get all your shots near and far. I miss a lot because I don't have the room or time to step back get closer or swap out lenses.The price differences between these 3 lense from Canon are from about $100.00 to $200.00 Don't get me wrong, the 300mm will do the job. But if you want more versatility without having to carry an extra lens and needing to change it out then you might want to explore options. If your a serious photographer then yes you probably want specialized lenses, but if your a soccer mom trying to get shots of your other child on the field while your other child is hanging all over you or your taking pictures at your kids birthday parties where their running everywhere far and near, or want to take your camera on vacation, then you might want a lens that has a more versatile zoom range and is more compact. But remember you won't have the second stabilizing mode for panning on these other lenses.""
"20110515","5.0","For the money, it's Five Stars","The EF-70 70-300 IS USM doesn't cost what the L-series version costs, it doesn't claim to be the equal of the L-series version, and it's not the equal. If you want bona fide 5-star optics and build, then pay at least twice as much and carry an extra pound of lens around. But for the money, this is a very nice lens, produces nice images, it's easy to use, and it's built reasonably well. Canon pretty much ticked all the boxes at price and focal length range. Image stabilization is really impressive and it will indeed give you at least a couple of extra stops--very handy at full zoom. A ring USM would have been preferable, but the USM as supplied generally did a good job and wasn't as noisy as I thought it might be.""
"20110503","5.0","Awesome lens!","I bought this lens as a gift for my husband.  We are amateur photographers who take photos for our own pleasure and memories.  We purchased this lens shortly before taking a cruise to the Caribbean islands.  It was delivered on time, packaged well and arrived in perfect condition.  The price was better than we were able to find in other online and retail places.  The lens was a great addition to our gear and worked beautifully to help capture island memories.""
"20110417","5.0","Worked great on Safari","I took this lens on a recent trip to Africa and it worked beautifully on my 60DI had planned to take a canon 100-400L which I really liked, but I needed something small enough to fit in my briefcase.  The 70-300is was perfect and I was very surprised by the high quality pics I got.  I got shots of a leopard and you can see the individual hairs on his eyebrows.  Not the whiskers which are obvious, but the eyebrows.I cropped one print in half and blew it up to 16x20 and I can't see any loss of detail.Colors look accurate and blend subtly. The 3 stop IS was great and necessary because everything was hand held.  I got bird shots with great feather detail and no blurring.Granted this isn't a fast lens and I didn't get any pics of birds flying or animals leaping.  However,for my use it was perfect.I've thought about upgrading to the new 70-300L but it's 3 times more expensive and I can't imagine it's that much better.""

You can spend a lot more for an L lens, the 70-200's or the new 70-300 L, but you'll be very satisfied with this lens.  The build quality is a little loose compared with the L series, still if you are not using it every day you'll be happy.""
"20110402","5.0","My husband loved it!

Needed to be able to zoom in and capture our kids who are moving fast.The cheaper lenses are no good, and the expensive ones--too expensive for what we're using it for.This is the best of all worlds for us and I would sincerely recommend it for a parent wanting to document a kid's activities. I wish so much we had purchased it years earlier. Now we can have great close-ups during high speed action that we never could capture before, especially in dimly lit gyms.It more than met our expectations and has been quite durable.""

"20110225","4.0","First use - not impressed at all - second use IMPRESSED","I am not a pro, but I am experienced. I own a T2i. I just got my lens and took it out for a trial shoot. It was raining outside and a little foggy. I took some pics of trees, a road sign illuminated by my headlights (shot through my windshield) and geese standing on an iced over pond. I was sitting in my car taking the shots through an open window (except the sign). I will say that I am not impressed at all and even disappointed. I shot the same scenes at F5.6 @300mm and F8 @300mm. I had the stabilizer on setting 1. I dont have the shutter speeds with me so I cant list those. The pics are VERY soft, almost out of focus. I checked the pics with Canon's software and noted even where the autofocus was focused on was very soft. Also the stablizer motor makes terrible noises. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I am going to try it again in better light before I send it back. I was so excited to get this lens based on the reviews here and the pro reviews I read elsewhere. Maybe I just got a bad copy. I also see the price went up about $20.Edit: Ok. LOL I was wrong.I took some more shots today in much better lighting and they turned out great. I Looked at the original shots that I judged the lens on and the fastest shutter was 1/25. I even had a couple at 1/10 and really for 300mm and that shutter speed they weren't that bad! I guess I am just so used to wide lenses (my other lenses are a Tokie 11-16 F2.8 and a Canon 15-85 F3.5-5.6) that I figured everything should be sharp even with slow shutters. My bad. Moving to 4 stars. The IS motor is noisy.""

I read all the reviews and they were very helpful and I chose this lens based on those reviews.  I have 2 sons that do competitive gymnastics and it is very difficult to get good close up shots of the action.  It is very fast, dimly lit and they are usually far away.  I used this lens for the first time this weekend and it was great. A little heavy but I got some really cool shots of them and their teammates in action!  There are some shots that could be put into movie format and would be just as good as the film version.  There was some hesitation with the auto focus at times, but I was very happy with the results.If you are not a professional and are just looking to get some good close ups I recommend this lens.  I am sure there is a lot more that I can do and I will be learning as I go.""

Sharpness and color are poor on this lens and it can be very frustrating when you review your photos at the end of a trek and toss, literally, all of them.  I sold this lens at significant loss and bought a used 70-200 f2.8 L (non IS).  The difference was stunning.  There is a reason the f4 is best in its class, don't make my mistake.  You can easily crop your super sharp photos to match the reach of the 70-300.  I've since bought a used 400mm f5.6 L - even at f5.6 the L glass is so superior to other products that it is easily hand-holdable (this lens is non IS) in all but the lowest light.  Additionally, the L lenses are built like tanks!  The f4 L will not dissapoint, buy it.""
"20101128","5.0","EF 70-300 was my second step - What's my THIRD in lenses?","A few years ago, I made the amazing forward step UP to a Canon SLR from a point-and-shoot that I liked very much.  The move took me into a hitherto unexplored spectrum of extraordinarily rewarding picture taking that was about as remarkable as adding a digital CD player to an outdated record machine with an average turntable.  It had a 100% WOW factor for me, the novice photographer with limited skill but (if I do say so myself) a pretty good eye for a great pic.I bought the Canon Rebel XTi with standard EFS 18-55mm lens . . . very satisfactory, but relatively unremarkable in some ways.  I wanted to 'take the next step' UP by adding a great telephoto lens and found myself examining $1,200 - $1,700 lenses that scared me away for a while.  When I garnered enough courage to return to the camera store, I discovered the EF 70-300 Zoom with Image Stabilizer and USM . . . all the bells and whistles I wanted and a perceived level of quality and value that bought its way into my camera bag with relative ease.  I became a BIG fan very quickly as I found that the lens easily multiplied my delight with the SLR digital photography experience and provided me with a considerable extension of the Rebel's base capabilities.The results of this super 'duo' have been no less than inspiring. And now, I'm ready for step #3.  So, oh universe of great photographer buddies, what shall be my next level of gratification?  I have definitely grown a lot in the last two years and want to add to my skills and volumes of happy experiences.Let me hear your comments and suggestions.  Thanks.CP""
