"20120612","3.0","Nikon Coolpix L120--worth it or not??","I got the Nikon Coolpix L120 in May 2011. Since then I have used it a lot and feel like I can give a full review. I was kind of disappointed by the zoom. It worked really well up to about 10x, but after that the camera couldn't focus. The camera quality is extremely grainy and washed out. I was really looking forward to something really high quality. The pictures themselves often turn out blurry. This is because the camera sets the shutter speed, and sometimes decides that it should take a whole second to take the picture!!! This really disappointed me and as a result many of the pictures turned out blurry. Also landscape and scenic pictures seem kind of washed out.Some of the things I did like included its viewing screen. It is 3-inches wide, with amazing picture viewing quality. And with the 14.1 megapixel camera, I definitely have gotten some amazing pictures. And like I said, the zoom worked really well at up to 10x, which is pretty good, even if I was really excited about 21x.Overall this camera is at a very affordable price, and is like a slightly higher tech point in shoot, with a cool, sleek body. It's a good camera for a beginning photographer (like me), but in the future, to take higher quality shots I will definitely get something a little more advanced, like a DSLR, but I will hang on to this little guy!Oh, and to answer the question in the title for my review, I would say this camera is worth it for beginner photographers, but if you are more advanced or even professional and are looking for something a little higher tech than a point and shoot, but lower tech than a DSLR, then I would keep looking. It doesn't have many of the features higher grade cameras do, and if you are used to working with those higher grade cameras, you will find yourself extremely frustrated with this camera.Hope this helped!!""

"20120602","5.0","Great supplement for an SLR","I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to find the perfect tag-along camera for my bulky SLR. I'm going on an out of country trip, and as much as I love my big camera, it can be a hassle, and honestly looks far too touristy for my taste.The L120 is the perfect in-between for those who don't want a giant camera, but also don't want to compromise quality with a pocket camera.It has great zoom, works well in low-light, and hasn't let me down while chasing my 2 year old son who just won't sit still for a good picture.""
"20120520","5.0","Great point and shoot camera","The only camera I've worked closely with is a Kodak Easyshare point and shoot.  This point and shoot far surpasses my Kodak.  The Nikon COOLPIX has been fun to learn.  It has surprised me with the amazing quality.  I especially love the results I got playing with the exposure.  If you don't want to move up to a DSLR which are much more expensive than I would highly recommend this camera because of the easy point and shoot functionality and the quality of the photos.""

"20120515","3.0","ok but not what i expected from a nikon","It's a hit and miss with the pictures.  After 1 year, I love the sports continuous shots but poor portrait quality.  I was so excited to get a Nikon but I get better pictures with my small point and shoot.  Go for another model from this company and you probably will be happier.""
"20120506","1.0","Bad camera","This is a very bad camera when it comes to zoom and focus. Do not buy !Works fine when you do not zoom. However when you zoom beyond 10X the autofocus goes wild and the picture keeps moving and that is the reason why people get fuzzy pictures. I am not sure if this product was fully tested by Nikon before it was released to the market or if just the one that I bought was bad. The white balance is poor and most indoor pictures have a yellowish tinge.All in all, it is a useless camera for anything more than wide angle shooting.""
"20120504","5.0","Great Camera","This camera takes great pictures, it takes a little getting used to. you need to hold the camera absolutely still to get a perfect picture, if you move a little the picture will turn out a little blurry. otherwise it is a great picture and takes really good pictures especially with the 21 optical zoom. It gets really good close up pictures.""
"20120426","1.0","Never again...","No view-finder. Mediocre lens (Though Nikon touts it as a Nikkor lens. They shouldn't be too proud of this one.) Smart focus not very 'smart' at all (A lot of my photos are taken along the Atlantic Ocean shore and smart focus cannot focus on the horizon of the ocean. Only the landscape mode will.) Most photos 'washed out.' And who really needs all these silly modes? I would have gladly given them all up for a decent lens and a view-finder. If I pop-up the flash, I expect a flash in any mode, but not with this camera. I paid full retail at $280.00; I easily paid that much for what should be at most a $100.00 camera. This was my first Nikon, and it is my last Nikon. Never again. It's back to Canon for me.""

"20111127","1.0","Almost bought it!","I'm a very casual user relying on the automatic features. After reading many of the reviews on this camera I thought I could live with the Video being so-so, but was concerned about the reviews that mentioned the 'blurry' pictures. I checked out the camera at Best Buy and comapared the Nikon coolpix L120 with a Panasonic DMC-ZS8. I took pictures of the boxes at the far end of the store at full and equal zoom with both cameras. The Nikon pictures were blurry. The Panasonics were crisp and sharp. Check it out before you buy this camera.""
"20111123","3.0","A good camera for those who are trying to learn from it","The problem with cameras designed for amateurs is that they attract exactly that, amateurs such as myself, who might not be able to get good pictures because photography is not something for amateurs. That being sad, I must say that I am happier now with this camera than I was three months ago when I bought it. I have managed to get around the most irritating problems, namely poor focus when anything moves (including the wind), not selecting the right 'mode' in 'easy mode' (for instance last week at about noon, full sun in the sierras, the camera chose 'night landscape' for a landscape picture and of course it resulted overexposed). I now can say that given my expertise and experience, I happily get 20 good pictures of 100 that I take. Now, the lack of manual controls is really annoying but it is not the camera's fault, it is my fault that I could not afford a camera with manual controls. A good choice if you are patient, willing to learn, willing to carry around, and use, a tripod, and concentrating on framing.""

"20111119","1.0","Blurry","I needed a camera with great zoom to take photos of my daughter during school functions, parties, sports and just plain old portrait shots.  I did my research thoroughly or so I thought I did.  Great reviews, recommended from Consumer Reports, sold.  Yes I did see a few stating their photos were blurry but hundred's of others loved their camera!  Well, guess what...blurry photos regardless of setting, lighting, etc.  Awful to the point it brought tears to my eyes when I looked at the shots of my daughter's play at school (only 10 rows away) and every single solitary shot was blurry. Tried a tripod the following week...no difference.  Emailed Nikon four times for help.  Their answer?  Leave the flash on at all times (which everyone who owns this camera knows you just can't do that as there are limited settings where flash is available). That's it??  There's nothing else you can do to help me?  I had such high hopes for this camera I really did.  Now I'm back to square one.  Trust me!!!  For a camera you can trust with capturing moments in your life and those of your children, look else where because sorry Nikon, I just can't get those back.""
"20111117","5.0","Cool Camera!!!","I always like fuji cameras... but the last time I ordered fuji, it was not working like it supposed to.

EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!!!  Especially when I try to use the video mode, you can zoom while recording and playing it back to see if you can hear the zooming (which fuji had disappointed me with) YOU CAN'T HEAR THE CAMERA ZOOMING....

"20111031","1.0","Buy cheap, buy twice","Im absolutely livid with myself for buying this camera.  I've gone through a divorce and been left with nothing (including the loss of my SLR cameras) and this was the one I could afford that promised to be the most similar to the SLRs.  I have a 2 year old son, and armed with only this camera, I have missed documenting the last 6 months of his time with me.  Every picture is blurred-- granted he's 2 and moves a lot, but even the slightest movement by the photographer blurs the image.  Blurred.  EVERYTHING.  I wish I had saved up and bought something decent.  I will take my loss on this one for an Amazon gift card, but DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  *sigh*""
"20111031","2.0","Not great for kid/family pictures","We have a Nikon digital SLR that I use and wanted a simpler point and shoot camera for taking pictures of family and kids.  The Coolpix L120 had some great specs and reviews, so we decided to try it.  We've also have an older Canon Powershot A720is point and shoot camera that we've really liked, but it was starting to not capture all of the shots in focus (seems to be a common problem with digital point and shoots as they get older).We really wanted to like the camera - it's comfortable to hold and seems to have all the features we needed.  However, our immediate impression was that so many of our shots of the kids were blurred by their motion.  It seems to work very well for still images, and as I look back over the previously posted pictures, most of the shots are still ones.  If there is any movement (and with kids from 18 months to 7 years, there always is), there is going to be some blur.  You don't have any sort of manual control over the shutter speed with this camera, so we were unable to correct for it through any of the modes.  There is a sports mode that will shoot many shots consecutively, but the resolution is cut down significantly to about 3Megapixels.I looked back over the reviews and found someone else who had a similar experience with the camera.  They had recommended a different Nikon point and shoot the Coolpix S8100 that seems to have worked well.  We returned this one and purchased a Nikon Coolpix P300.  It gives you a little more control as compared to the Coolpix s8100 with a metal case and a very fast lens (f/1.8).  The fast lens means that it can choose a faster shutter speed to capture kids before they move.  It also has a sports continuous mode that will shoot full resolution shots at a very high speed.The pictures with the P300 are night and day as compared to the L120.  No more motion blur, and it is very responsive (not as fast as a digital SLR, but still good).  The zoom range is much more limited than the L120, but most of our shots are of reasonable distances from the kids at home, outside, or at a party.  For this, the camera is excellent.  We didn't really buy the P300 for the video, but it works well and looks good.In hindsight, we should have paid more attention to the speed of the lens.  The Canon point and shoot we have is a f/2.8 lens (which is very good/fast) and the P300 has a f/1.8 lens (which is even better for low light/action photography).  I think the L120 with a f/3.1 lens should work well, but it seems that the metering consistently selects a longer shutter time (even with the flash) and we just haven't been able to get good pictures unless the subject is completely still.""
"20111028","4.0","Cool Nikon Pick","Ordered on Sunday afternoon and it was delivered on the following Saturday afternoon. Just in time for my upcoming camping trip and football game weekend. This camera does all it says it can do. I love it. Perfect for someone like me who's not a professional but still wants ample shooting options. A little slow to re-focus on the zoom. Thats the only con I can see. Takes great pictures and allows you to edit them right on the camera. Coolpix L120 is the bomb.com!!""
"20111027","5.0","Awesome Camera","This is an awesome camera for a non-pro and for those that don't want to drop a small fortune for a professional SLR camera.  There is a bit of a learning curve for those who are used to just pointing and shooting pictures on a standard digital camera.  My advice is to play with each mode available to determine in what situations what mode will give you the best quality pictures.  Eventually it will become second nature to you.Also, with certain modes it does take some time for the focus to become clear.  I have found that backing out the zoom and slowly zooming in on your target will produce a better focus.  I will be purchasing a tripod as this will also help with picture quality for modes where you are zooming in (no matter how steady you think you are, even with the anti-shake on, you will find it takes a lot of skill to get a clear picture because you are moving the camera even when you don't think you are).Also, this is what I call a two-stage snapper.  When you press the button to take a photo, the first stage brings the picture into focus and the second actually takes the photo.  The LCD screen will let you know when the optimal time to fully press the button by turning the red box to a green box.I have take some very spectacular pictures with this camera already (especially the macro mode).  I am very happy with this purchase!""
"20111026","5.0","really happy","My wife has really enjoyed using this camera.  It has all the features she was looking for including the super zoom.  I might have to get a second one just so I can use it.""
"20111026","4.0","Great Product","This is a great camera. As previously stated by another review, you have to take some time to at least learn the basics as to how to properly use this camera, otherwise you could end up with a ton of blurry photos. However, once you use it and learn how to operate it correctly, it takes wonderful pictures both in motion and still shots. So far this camera has been used on a recent vacation and a school activity and has provided excellent quality shots both daytime and nighttime. The only negative I have found with the product is that you must manually raise the flash to activate auto flash. It can be seen as a positive, though. Sometimes it is annoying when you forget to raise it, and you need flash, but it is also helpful because then youknow for a fact that you will have a picture with flash or without flash depending on whether it is raised or not. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a camera that takes great, crisp photos.""

I am also impressed that I can zoom in fully on the moon and take pics that show full detail of craters. With my cameras of the past (Fuji FinePix S9000 and a 12mp Kodak EasyShare) all I could get of the moon was a streak of white light. If I can, I will post a pic just to show you the detail involved.I have recommended this camera to all my friends. Its perfect for my little family and the type of shots we like to take.""

The literature indicates the flash should be operative in Easy Mode.  The flash did work in Auto Mode.  I am returning this camera.

"20111021","5.0","Amazing Photos, Difficult Flash Control","I would give this camera 4.5 stars if it were an option.We ordered this camera because, with a baby on the way, we wanted a camera that would take great photos quickly and easily, and does well indoors and in low light WITHOUT the complications of a Digital SLR.  This turned out to be a really amazing answer to what we were looking for, with very few downsides.PROS:-Amazing and accurate color and clarity in the photos.-Absolutely no noticeable 'grain' in low light photos.-Very, very low lag time between pressing the button and the camera capturing the image for a point and shoot.-Many presets for many situations (indoors, fireworks, macro, etc.)-Just great photos.CONS:-Slightly larger that we thought it would be, but this isn't a big problem.-Little to no customization of settings. (No changing of aperture or F stop, or anything really). You have to mess with all of the presets to find what works in each situation. (This isn't an issue for us, we really got this camera to pull out and capture moments anywhere and anytime, and the presets are amazing.)-The flash doesn't automatically flip up when low light is detected, you have to do it manually.-In 'Easy Auto' mode, it is impossible to get the flash to remain 'on', it is always auto and resulted in motion blurred photos. (This is remedied by using one of the presets, where you have more control over the flash'Overall, this is the best camera I have used in it's class and the price is amazing.  We love it and have had zero buyers remorse.""

I was recording a video and its started  acting weird, the focusing  did not work and every time I clicked the shooting button it turned off ! So at Nikon i was told nothing was wrong  but instead i was told that the cause of it was that my sd card was almost full. It could be but I'm not too sure.Since I have read about the same problem with other people.Any way I was taking pictures xmast  nigth and I could not make the flash work for me it did not let me use it ,it did work but not in the auto mode i guess the camera takes over and decides when its needed buyt the pictures were too dark. And lastly you really have to wait a couple of seconds and the subjects must not  move a hair or it will be blurry (in low ligth conditions only) I have no time for all this drama i will stick to my D3100 wich really is excellent.

"20110910","5.0","cool Nikon COOLPIX","So far I have tried this camera in my garden and in my house.  I think the photos came out rather well.  I read the instructions to connect it to the computer and may have had to experiment a little before I actually found where the photos were stored in my files; however, this did not take a lot of time.  I feel comfortable with it and look forward to when I fully understand all it has to offer.  I was glad to have received it so quickly as I want to use it for some wedding photos in the near future.  I must say that the len's cap is frustrating as once it is taken off, it does not go back.""

"20110903","2.0","Returned it... Quick. Not good enough for that kind of money.","Okay, nobody was expecting DSLR quality from a hyped up super zoom point and shoot, but I did expect it to do better than my old 8 megapixel Canon A590IS. Surprisingly it did not. I was attracted, as I'm sure a lot of people are, by the DSLR look, the impressive zoom capability, and color. Smile detection as well as other features caught my eye, of course. But to start off, the zoom very much failed to live up to the expectations raised by the ads. Anything beyond 2-4x was highly pixelized. In fact, though the colors were superb on this camera, most pictures were far worse in quality than my 8 megapixel point and shoot. I actually had to reduce the size of the images by half in order to cover up this camera's shortcomings. (which obviously makes the print capabilities fall short of the print sizes boasted which were supposed to be better than most point and shoots.) I found the macro to be lacking as well. I did side by side comparisons with my old 8 megapixel Canon A590IS and found that the canon beat it every time in macro, and almost every time in most other areas. Color was one of the exceptions. But I can get the same results by using photoshop to enhance the colors on my old camera's pictures. And yes it's nice to be able to zoom in on a bird in a tree a long distance away, but if the picture is so pixelized that you have to size it down to 300 by 300 pixels in order to make it look good, what's the point? Yes up close, it takes some decent pictures, but don't try to use the zoom. I say keep my a590 which I can buy lenses for until I save up enough for a real dslr. And honestly? If you want an SLR, spend about a hundred bucks or less more and buy a low end DSLR at around 10 megapixels. The image quality will be far better. For now, look up the cheaper point and shoots for around 60-150 and you'll get better shots than this. I can speak personally for the Canon models, but I'm sure some of the more basic Nikons are just as good. My personal experience with super zoom cameras is that they pretty much suck. Don't bother. The added zoom power is worthless if the quality of the photo is bad.""
"20110901","5.0","Nikon Coolpix L120","We previously had a Canon Powershot digital camera.  I spent most of my life using a SLR camera but my wife cannot cope with the intricacies of this technology.  Hence our first digital camera was the Canon Powerpoint. We decided we wanted a replacement camera with a good telephoto lens and after doing much research we decided on the Nikon Coolpix L120.  Wow what a camera!  For its price and features it is amazing.  We take pictures of birds at our farm using max range on the telephoto and even though we don't have the most stable hands we are able to get wonderfully clear shots.  Its controls are easy to use and it compares very favorably with more expensive camera's.  It takes good photographs in poor light without using the flash.  I can only say that my wife and I are thrilled with the clarity and quality of photographs.  We would strongly recommend it to others seeking a wider capability of telephoto lens and flexible controls for special shots.  It is not a small handbag camera which is desired by many folk these days, but it is well worth the effort to lug around on vacations and family visits etc.  On the superficial side, it is a very attractive and sophisticated looking camera - we got the red one which has a particularly smart look to it. Great camera for its price!""

I searched the internet and found this one with 'Great' reviews and it was sold at a store near where I was so I ran out and bought the last one they had. It was new and from a reliable store. I and my husband read the manuel and it was easy to figure out. We both also have a lot oh camera knowledge. I am dismayed to say that EVERY Photo taken with this camera was Blurred, poorly lit even when flash was used and even in video the movie and sound quality are the worst I have ever seen. All photos both indoors and outdoors are awful in every way you can think of. More then one person took photos using this camera even a professional photographer and all are bad. Not a single one worth keeping. I bought this because I had not seen these relatives since I was a kid and wanted photographs for memories. Now I will have to rely on just my memory. I used the no name brand $20.00 camera I bought for my 12 year old daughter for some pictures and though it does not take great photos it blew away the photos taken with the Nikon l120.Unfortunately The receipt had gotten lost on our trip. I purchased it The day after easter of this year 2011. Basically now I am stuck with a camera I will never use and out the $279.99 it cost. I usually love nikon products but this is the exception. I will now think twice before buying Nikon again no matter how good the reviews are.I had to give it ! star only because it would not let me leave it at 0 stars which is what it should be.""

"20110731","5.0","NIKON Coollpix L120 Camera","I read the reviews of this camera by previous buyers, and on websites for photographers who review cameras for a livingbefore I decided to buy this camera through Amazon.  I got the camera at the best price on Amazon, with free shipping plus my creditcard rewards and a gift certificate too.I took it on vacation with me one week later and was amazed and very happy with the camera's performance.  It's very easy to use and I am still trying out new things with it.I think the battery life has been great so far and I am fully satisfied with how it performs.  The lense cap cover gave me some problems at first, not having to remove a cap from my old camera, I had to make it a habit to remove it first before turning on the camera.  It is quiet and smooth as you turn it on, so taking pictures of babies and pets or wildlife is easy because it doesn't scare your subject.I am not an expert photographer, just a grandmother who wants good pictures of my family.  My reason for buying this camera was the desire to be able to take good long shots at school functions of my grandchilden that are clear and of good quality.  The smaller camera's I have had (that were easy to use)never took good pictures from a distance.  The zoom is great and fast on this camera so you don't miss shots.The only drawback too this camera is the fact that it needs batteries.  The last small camera I bought has a lithium battery and that battery has a long life.  This camera is also a little heavy but that is outweighed by the quality of the pictures it takes.  I Can't wait to try it on a tripod and do some family sitting poses.All in all, I would say, buy it and enjoy it.  You won't be sorry!""

But I cannot work out how to get it to shoot more than 20 continuous shots at once.Auto portrait mode is interesting and good if you only have use of one hand. Auto portrait will take photos by itself when it recognizes a face.Not something I would use often but interesting enough.Motion video recording is O.K. quality, but not the main reason I bought this camera, so not really something to gripe about.Be sure to get at least a 30Mb/s class 10 SD-HC card for taking video though.This camera has and will continue to get a whole lot of use from me.My best purchase this year!""

I wanted something with amazing quality, great zoom and a nice look and feel - not quite SLR and not a regular point and shoot (I have one of those already!).  This met my need and exceeded my expectations.  Like many other reviews, this is not for a professional photographer.

I have read everything that came with the camera and tried every single setting and the only mode that is usable on this camera is the 'smart portrait' mode. Every other mode whether zoomed in or zoomed out, results in extremely blurry pictures. I don't have any medical issues that cause me to shake, I would say I am average if not better than average in the 'shaky hand' department. I was so excited to get a camera that would take black and white pics, but that mode is useless, because as I previously stated, the only mode that will give a clear crisp picture is the smart portrait mode. I am extremely disappointed and will be returning it unless I figure out that I am in fact missing what the big deal is about this camera. I just find it hard to believe that ANYONE would rate this camera above a 1 star with the way mine is currently working.""
"20110724","5.0","Coolpix Review","I bought this camera based on the reviews. I previously had a Nikon D40x that died and it was going to cost $250 to fix it, so I decided to look into a point and shoot camera instead. I've taken night shots, fireworks shots, close-ups, action shots, and more. I love it. The action setting is amazing!! I can't believe how clear these pictures come out. I was actually really impressed with the video quality as well. I went to a Toby Keith concert and shot some video and it came out fantastic, which I wasn't expecting given the reviews I had read of the video quality. The fireworks mode is also fantastic. The zoom is great...I was surprised how close you can get and how clear the pictures are (you do have to hold it very steady though).The SD card is in the battery compartment, which is the only negative I have to say about this camera. It would be nice if it was located in a more convenient place.""

I take pictures of recipes I'm creating to post on my blog and it does great handheld shots without the flash. Now, if I could find the manual...I tried to find one to download and struck out.""
"20110724","4.0","Great Camera!","Over all I think that this is a great camera. I chose this one over the Canon SX 130 and I am still happy with my decision. This camera is for those people that really just want a point and shoot camera without worrying about settings. All the settings are pre-determined and you can choose things like whether you're shooting indoor or outdoor but you cant choose aperture or some of the more specific personalized settings. (if you want that then go for the Canon).One of the reasons I chose this camera was because of the display. It is a big display with crisp clear images that transfer well on a computer screen. (the canons screen was very grainy) also the hd video is amazing. the images come out so vivd and living and full of color.The only things that I have experienced that are a little irksome are 1. battery life during video. while the battery life for pictures is fairly decently long the battery life for taking video (which is one of the main reasons i chose this camera) is rather short. normal double a batteries last approximately 3 hours. this may be different for rechargeable batteries, they may last longer, i haven't tried it yet. so just be warned that if you plan on using it a lot for video taking (not just once in a while, i am talking about using it for video only, throughout the day) then you might want to get rechargeable batteries.2. while taking video when zooming in or out sometimes it will have to auto refocus which fuzzes the video for a second. this could just be me and my so far lack of knowing how to properly zoom. but just know that there is that issue.3. the rapid photo shoot mode isnt the greatest. i tried to take a rapid picture of my friend jumping off a 15 foot diving board and because of the way that rapid shoot was made i dont know when it is actually taking the picture and when its loading. ( a little timeglass comes up and sits on the screen for about 30 seconds).overall i still think it is a great camera and i would highly suggest it to those who want an easy point and shoot camers with great video quality. for those who want it to use for making video (5 minute youtube movies) i would suggest getting rechargeable batteries.for those of you who like to be able to pick your own settings like aperture etc. this isn't the camera for you""

"20110721","5.0","Everything I hoped for and more!","I am not a professional photographer and this is my first digital camera.  I would first like to simply confirm everything Mr. Rosenow has said about this camera.  For those of you, like myself, however, who are looking for a truly impressive point and shoot, I can confidently say, 'look no further'.  Within less than a half hour out of the box, I was taking outdoor pictures that were truly impressive for a camera at this price point.  I sent a few of these off to a friend of mine whose husband is a professional photographer and she reported back how impressed she was with their quality.  Then I took some panoramic pictures of my back field and stitched them together with the incredibly easy-to-use software that is included without even reading the manual first, and I've never even done this before!  The results blew me away.  Once I actually read the manual, I got even better results.If I have a single complaint, it would be with the quality of my indoor shots. Some of my photos tended to be quite grainy. But please bear in mind that I have a LOT to learn about photography yet, so you must take this 'complaint' with a very large grain of salt.  I think once I work with this camera a bit more and learn more about indoor lighting techniques, I have a feeling this will become a non-issue.  I still rated image quality with a 5 based on the results of all of my outdoor shots.  Most of those photos were of my animals who are sometimes in constant motion and, using the Pet mode (called a 'scene' on the menu), they turned out terrific.  Please note:  I used a tripod in most cases.Again, I don't have a lot to add to Mr. Rosenow's excellent review.  I simply wanted to reinforce his findings and add my two cents from the perspective of someone just getting started with digital photography.""

"20110718","4.0","So far, so good","I've only had this camera a few weeks and I don't take pictures every day so I may change my mind a bit over time on this camera.I bought it to replace a Canon Powershot that I really love except for the way it eats batteries.  That camera would say batteries were dead even though they really had half the charge left.  So, I finally gave in to my partner and got this camera so that I'd stop complaining. What happened is I've traded one complaint for another - sigh...So far, I've not had to change the batteries in this camera so it's tons better than the Canon in that regard.  What I don't like, and this is true of almost all the digital point and shoot cameras now, is that there is no view finder.  I was hoping that the larger LCD screen would make it easier to use in bright sunshine, but that is not the case.  I was on a whale watching trip recently and didn't manage to get the whale in any of the still shots I took.  I did manage to get it in one piece of video.  Whether that would have been different had I had a viewfinder, I can't say for sure, but I would have been more comfortable.  However, having said that, I would also say this is a nice camera.If you don't want to spring for the big bucks of an SLR (and I didn't) this camera is reasonably priced and does a good job.  It seems that camera manufacturers have taken pity on us and gotten together on their controls because the controls on this are very similar to my Canon so that made for a much easier learning curve initially.  However, I'm sure there is much to learn to take full advantage of all the features of this camera.It did take me a while to figure out how to force the flash.  The camera doesn't come with a printed manual - it's on a CD - so if you need to look up how to do things, you'll need a computer handy.  Overall, I think I will really enjoy using this camera once I get past the lack of the viewfinder.  I'll try to remember to update this in a few months after I've had a chance to use the camera more.""

"20110711","3.0","Good, but not great camera","I bought this camera so I didn't have to lug 5 lbs of D200 around with me all the time.  It weights about as much as a deck of cards.  I don't think it will last long given the plastic, but if you are looking for a point and shoot system that will do video, this camera will work.I don't like the vibration reduction.  They should call it 'image destruction' since you get nice grainy shots and a pic killing 1 second delay using it.  I switch it off and get nice clear shots and fast reaction time.  Using the camera is pretty easy once you get used to the layout.  Nikon wants you to basically pick your type of shot (night, pet, fireworks etc) from a menu, and then they set the camera up for optimum conditions.  But that is annoying.  I find more advanced Nikon cameras easy enough to use, I just don't like the weight.  I would call it an intermediate camera from the $100 point and shoot crowd to the price point of the $500 SLRs out there.I would go into a camera store and examine one before buying it to be sure of what you are getting.  There are some fine cheap digitals that fit in a pocket out there, and you can't beat the cheap SLRs either.  It is a good time to be a photographer, for sure.""
"20110711","5.0","Everything and more","I really love this camera. I was upgrading from a smaller camera (that I did like because it would fit easily in my purse or pocket depending upon the pants) in order to have a better zoom and more features. I debated long and hard on those available on Amazon had it narrowed down to this one and a canon and decided this one was better because it took regular batteries instead of a battery pack. I figured in an emergency, batteries was better. I was shocked that the batteries that came with the camera lasted as long as they did. I played with the camera when I got it, used it off and on and even went on vacation all on the same 4 batteries. That was delightful. I also really like that the flash does not pop up automatically. It took a minute to get used to that because I didn't expect it, but I prefer having the choice instead of the camera deciding for me. I work for a newspaper and we had all always griped through the years that it was a pain or impossible to stop the flash. No complaints thus far!""
"20110705","5.0","The L120 and I; A Love story","I've had the L120 for a while now, and this is our love story. When I first got the camera I was so excited. I immediately opened the box and started getting to know the camera. Like every love story, there are a few bumps in the road to happiness. The first thing I noticed is that the sport continuous feature is not my favorite. In fact, my CoolPix from a few years ago has a better sport feature. There's lots of noise in the picture, and the edges are fuzzy sometimes. After fiddling with it for a while, and reading the manual, the fuzzy edges were no longer a problem. But there is still a lot of noise in the picture. I live right near the attractions in Orlando so I headed to Universal and took some pictures in the Wizarding World. The second thing I noticed was that the lens cap falls off easily when in a carrying case. The third thing I noticed was that the battery life is not wonderful. After reading previous reviews I was prepared for that, and I had rechargable batteries ready. However there are some really great features to this camera. Inside lighting is not a problem. Inside the castle at the wizarding world is very dark. This camera had no problem with this, and I have some amazing pictures from the portrait gallery. No flash needed. Adjusting the ISO is very easy, but most of the time you don't need to do any adjusting. My favorite feature with this camera, however, has to be the macro mode. It has a great zoom, which is great for sporting events and such. Since yesterday was the 4th, I also got a chance to try out the fireworks mode, which turns out is nice. It has a longer exposure than my other cameras, which is fun when you have sparklers and you can do light writing. All in all, I really do love this camera. It's my new favorite and I enjoy using it.""

The camera is great looking, easy to learn and comfortable for one-handed up-in-the-air, on-the-go picture taking.  In the Plus category: lightweight despite the need for 4 batteries; I took almost 3,000 images before having to replace my lithium batteries; great quality movies with good audio and stable playback; ability to crop images; color choices -- love the red!  My fellow travelers marveled at the ease of use, number of features that are relatively easy to maneuver, the quality of photos ... and the red!  In the Negative category:  the fact that I can't play .MOV movies on Windows Media Player and Windows Movie Maker which I'm comfortable with was a disappointment when I got home and found I couldn't watch the movies of the water flowing over Victoria Falls or the elephants and rhinos crossing the road or the giraffes grazing or the zebra tails wagging or the hippos bobbing up and down or the lions eating :(  But maybe I just need to learn how to convert the format or learn new software.

Here are the positives:+Nice, well built body, feels fantastic in hands, very natural and not too large+Beautiful close ups, although can be a bit hard to find a focus+Easy, simple to use interface+Takes 4aa batteries, which was a big plus to me as they can be purchased anywhere, anytime.+The flash will never accidentally go off as button must be pushed+colors are generally nice and vibrant+Takes nice low light photos, but only with flash on.Negatives:-Photos easily blurred, and there is no flash available for pet mode or sport mode.-Flash does not go off when you put it up, you have to set it to on with button, inconvenient.-Red eye flash gives terrible color to photosOverall the thing that killed it with this camera was the blurry images. It's not reliable and very finicky. The pet setting is the best way to shoot moving subjects, although not perfect, it does take a pretty good sport photo with vr stabilization on. In pet mode you are able to take one picture at a time and the pictures come out quite well in sunlight. (play around with settings a bit to get a decent IQ) Continuous shots are available too, but not as smooth operating as other cameras i've used. The problem I have is indoor movement pictures. Without flash options on pet setting or continuous sport mode, my pictures are very substandard. I want to capture my kids blowing out their candles, roughhousing with each other, unwrapping presents, etc. If I were able to use flash mode it would be a much better camera for moving subjects. Don't get me wrong, I've gotten excellent pictures of my kids sitting still, and good ones of them moving outside, but anything inside with any movement is very hard to capture. Even outside pics are going to be blurry IF you aren't using the correct settings. For landscape photos and close ups this camera is very good. With a heavy heart I have returned this camera and instead am trying the nikon p500, hoping for more kid friendly results.Finally: I posted 2 of what I believe to be AMAZING pictures. Please take a look, this camera may be exactly what YOU are looking for.""
"20110626","4.0","Patino's opinion on Nikon","Recently purchase the Nikon Coolpix L120.  My main purpose was to get a camera that was easy to use.  I wanted a point & shoot camera that had the ability to zoom in/out and still produce quality pics.  Was able to use the product right out of the box.  The quick start guide was all I needed.  Have taken some photos with the telephoto and it is working as it advertised.  Have not used all the features yet but so far I am satisfied.""
"20110626","5.0","Great Point & Shoot","I've owned this camera for a couple of weeks and am impressed with the ease of use and the quality of the shots. Granted the easy auto leaves something to be desired, but the other modes, portrait, night landscape, pet, etc have all produced wonderful pictures. I haven't really used the video feature enough to form an opinion on it. I have a camcorder for video, so that feature is not important to me. If you're looking for a camera that's easy to use right out of the box with a great zoom, you can't go wrong with the L120.""

"20110622","5.0",".","I love this camera! I haven't had any major problems with it yet.The only thing I don't really like about it is that it uses AA batteries, I wish it would have a rechargeable battery because I use it so much.""
"20110620","5.0","Impressive!","I have always been a Kodak customer, so never thought I'd stray & had purchased a Kodak M580 earlier in the year (it was time to upgrade from my Kodak 6440---which took beautiful pics). I just wasn't happy with it though. Doing a lot of hiking I wanted a camera that took good shots. So I grumpily started looking at camera's again and looked at the Kodak Z981 and Z991 bridge camera's--still wanting to stay with Kodak.  I'm not sure how I fell into the Nikon L120, but in comparing it to the Kodaks and the Canon sx30is (?), reviews were good consistently and pictures appeared to be better, so I decided to take the plunge and buy the Nikon.  LOVE this camera! Easy to use, no complicated menu's, crisp clear pictures. The camera self adjusts ISO quickly and accurately. I seldom use the flash even indoors. Pictures are rarely blurry, even on zoom they are acceptably clear--without a tri-pod. I'm on the Nikon L120 page on FB, where over the last full moon a young man in India (or somewhere in that area) took a pic of the moon, I laughed and said it looked like my moon, so posted mine--on both you could see the shading on the moon. Someone took a pic of the half moon (he must have used a tri-pod) and you could even see the craters. Phenomenal. My sister-in law has a high end Canon, and even on her zoom extension couldn't get the detail. The detail on macro is incredible and, to my eye anyway, indistinguishable from a DSLR.I put lithium battery's in it and they are still hanging in there, so I'm very satisfied with the battery life.  I absolutely recommend this camera for anyone who might want a little more than a compact will offer,  who wants to be able to get creative but still have the ease of an automatic.***Just an update, still love it, and take it snowshoeing with me, as well as roam around the country finding old barns, etc. People always ask me what kind of camera I'm using. I think they think I have a real high end DSLR.***""

I know that you have to push the button down halfway first to focus, but this camera did not work inside at all.  Horrible pictures.

"20110615","2.0","Disappointed","UPDATE: I took a few pics with this camera and the issues are the same. I also bought at another warehouse that starts with the letter C, the Coolpix S8100, as that also has good reviews and is fairly zippy in the speed department (bootup, shot to shot and burst mode). The difference is night and day. I am going to post up a picture of a comparison shot I did, with the S8100 right out of the box. Let me put it this way, after two L120's (I REALLY wanted to love this camera), on this one shot of the S8100, I took 8 shots with the L120, and NONE of them came out as clear as the S8100. Only one came close, and after looking at it on the display, I redid the shot, same settings and it was more blurry than before. EIGHT SHOTS!!!!! I ahve a 16GB card, but EIGHT SHOTS for none to come out clear???? Unacceptable. I'm not a fool, I've taken digital photography courses, and know how to hold and shoot a camera. But the quality was unacceptable. I'm glad some of you have taken great pictures. Maybe Sam is getting junk at his club, but TWO???? C'mon. Look for the picture of the Toy Story cups. Its sad to see this camera go, but it must.______________I bought this camera after extensive reviews. Everyone generally seems to like it and only a few complain about the quality and the blurriness of the photos. I am now in that complaining group. We got this camera because our old Canon A540 died on us. I know the wife was the reason as she always complained about the slow shot to shot speed of that one. So while she wanted something faster, I wanted something that had a better zoom, and actually felt like a camera. I was hoping, before it died, to replace it next year, with the Lumix GF3 that was coming out next month. I figured next year's tax money would pay for the camera. However, we couldn't wait, nor did we want to spend $600+ on a camera. sooooo....I bought the camera from one of the big warehouse stores. I LOVE the camera in terms of how it feels, the options, etc. The continous mode was great. very speedy. I've held and tested various Fuji and Kodak models, and I wasn't impressed with the menus of the Fujis and the Kodak, i've always felt something was missing. I was told Asthon Kucher used this in a commercial so I joked I would take it back then. since this was the first dSLR-looking camera we had, I started to read the manual to try and figure it out first. I am the one that usually figures the settings out, and the wife usually does the auto.. So, I'd take a few pics of the kids on various settings to see which was better. Throughout it all, the camera was very hit or miss in terms of quality.Let me explain. On some shots, like of the kids from about 15 feet away zoomed in, I'd do the Easy Auto and it would be ok. slight blurry of them. I'd move to another mode, and really blurry. I'd go back to the easy and it would be blurry. I'd do several, just to make sure the kids didn't move (while telling them to not move) or I moved, but each time they'd get blurry, some more than others. Same thing with using flash. I don't like how I cannot dial the flash down, like the A540's, but the camera did take better shots without the flash in some instances, than the A540. However, again, sometime the camera would get blurry. I found that in many instances, if the kids were anywhere close, the Auto mode, with Flash fill worked best. But then again, sometimes it was good, others not, but usually it was.Outside was better. I took pics of the kids running around in the sprinklers and they generally came out ok.But it wasn't as good as our old pokey A540. For the price of the camera, the pics should have been better. Taking longer zoom pics generally were blurry, even with the vibration and antishake enabled. I tried changing the focusing modes, ISO, etc, and it didn't help. The wife wanted to get rid of it before and get a cheaper one, but I insisted to give it another try as the cheaper ones wouldn't be as fast. However, the quality kept being a disappointment.Since I REALLY want to like this camera, I took it back and got another one, which was fine for me, as the price went down, and as a result, the extended warranty did too. So for less then the camera in the 1st place, I got the camera and extended warranty.Initial shots showed the same issues, but we will see this weekend. I'll post up an update. However, I am now looking at the Nikon S8100 as it has a 10x zoom, and is very speedy. I may buy that one and do side by sides when I use them both to compare. I also like the Canon S4500 too. Who knows.""
"20110614","3.0","Great camera for beginners","This camera is for folks who want point and shoot capability, a good zoom lens, and do not need manual controls. If you want the camera to do all the thinking for you, then this is the right camera for you.The Nikon L120 has only minimal manual adjustment controls. Menu navigation is not very user friendly or intuitive, and the functions are very limited. The self timer only has one setting - 10 seconds. You can adjust exposure compensation and ISO, but that's it. The zoom is jerky and I missed a few great shots of wildlife because the image stabilization software kept making image captures, which are supposed to help (not!) instead of showing the actual view. Test drive it in the store and you will see what I mean. I recommend turning the image stabilization off, and using A tripod for long zooming. There is no manual override for fill flash.On the plus side this camera is compact and stylish, and the continuous mode is fast. The smile mode worked great, but I had a hard time getting the pet mode to recognize my pet and snap the picture automatically, even when my cat or dog were looking directly at the camera. The pet must be perfectly still for a full two seconds or so to get the face frame to appear. Pets don't stay still for long! These issues prompted me to return this camera and purchase the Canon SX30IS. The SX30IS has better manual controls and a much better zoom mechanism and image stabilization software.""

"20110608","4.0","Some pros & cons but worth what you pay","First off let me start by saying...I have always used Kodak digital cameras.  I did an upgrade from a Kodak 7.1 mp with x10 optical zoom to this L120.  I have had it for about a month now which has been plenty of time for an adjustment period:PROS:-The image quality is better. (that could be from the doubling my MP)-Can take several shots in Sports mode/action pics.  You can control the number to low/medium/high-The images are beautiful in low lighting. They are not blurry.  Don't always have to have that flash that can sometimes white out the image.-The battery life is great...I used the ones that came with the camera(which were AA akline). Still have 3/4 battery life.  After using camera several times a day.-CONS:-* the mannual is on a CD!  So it was really hard to figure out how the camera worked because you have to look it up answers on the computer (which was not always available)*-The Auto mode I do not like.  My Kodak took better images in auto mode.  I have tried several different scenarios alot of the time they would come out blurry.  So I pick my settings. Not fully grasping the Five-way VR Image Stabilization they say the camera offers.-It take a few mins to adjust your settings so you miss alot of action if your not familiar with what you are doing.With all that said...for the money you pay it is worth it.  I enjoy taking pictures and will enjoy using it hopefully for years.""

"20110608","5.0","I Love This Camera","I am thrilled with my purchase of this camera. I have taken MANY pictures with this camera and the batteries (regular energizer batteries) have held up very well. I got the rechargeable ones but can't review them because I haven't ran down these yet. (maybe it's the battery options need changed in some cases) I really can't understand the ones who complained about that, but that's my experience. The zoom captured a photo of a photo of my boyfriend (group football pic) from an auditorium wall, from the other side of the room, and the picture quality on that was even great. I'm shocked! I'd definitely recommend this camera. It's VERY easy to use and I LOVE the fact that the zoom is on the left. I couldn't be happier. Everything is at your fingertips and it's easy easy easy to use.

So far I am still using the alkaline batteries that came with the camera and have taken well over 200 pictures and a few videos and the battery still shows full charge so it doesn't look to be too much of a battery hog.

It locks on focus fairly quickly, though not as quick as a dSLR; good enough for what I do.  The only issue I have is that it doesn't do well with sunlight glare.  I wish Nikon would make an optional 'hood' for it.  I also have to set the exposure one click on the + side since picture tend to come out just a smidgen too dark.  Other than that I'd definitely recommend this camera.""

"20120326","4.0","Great "Lifestyle" Camera","Although I do a considerable amount of commercial work (or perhaps because I do!), when I'm out for the day with family or traveling, I want a camera that takes decent stills and video, has good zoom, a reasonably small form factor, and 'just-take-the-shot' performance features.This camera does the job, and incidentally does fantastic close-ups.  I mean really close-up.  It has enough automatic modes that you can be very creative without needing a manual (as in, 'read the manual') mode.  In fact, a great deal of photographic creativity has nothing whatsoever to do with setting apertures and shutter speeds.  (However, it is interesting that the camera does inform you what settings it's using for a shot.)  I have another P&S, a Canon 500 HS, that gives me aperture and shutter priority modes, but I rarely use them - or need them - for lifestyle photography.  Most of the time the Canon stays home because it has limited zoom, which is much more important for this type of photography than tweaking exposure settings. Plus, there's always a lot of creative things you can do with your photo editing software if you've got a good shot to start with, and this Nikon will give you lots of good shots.The L120 isn't exactly a pocket camera, but it fits my belt pack just fine and I *rarely* carry a camera in my pocket anyway.  It has a nice solid feel and a much better grip profile than most P&S cameras - more like a DLSR - and although I prefer knobs and dials from my old film SLR days, the touch screen is plenty fast and responsive.AF can be a little laggy, and at times the camera does seem to get confused about focus as some have mentioned.  However, I find that releasing and re-depressing the shutter button halfway usually grabs the focus, and if not a quick off-on cycle takes care of things.Low light (indoor ambience, lamp light) performance is more than adequate.  I like the flip-up flash (which separates it further from the lens axis than most P&S cameras), and it performs very well.Cycle on to first shot and shot-to-shot speed is just fine.  The view/settings screen is quite sharp, although like most it does suffer some in direct bright sunlight.Video is just fine for this type of camera and casual short clips.  Would I use it to shoot 'Gone With The Wind'?  Uh, no.  The audio is also perfectly adequate - again, you're not working with a boom mike.It's a huge bonus that this camera runs on normal AA batteries, too.  Although it seems to be pretty economical with battery life, there's nothing like being able to run into any 7-11 store (or most places in the world, for that matter) and get batteries if you need them.  If you've ever run out of those precious electrons while traveling, you can appreciate this.NO camera is everything to everybody, or even everything that any one person might want.  But for a camera that you can really use but that doesn't take you 'out of the moment' fiddling with settings, this Nikon is my all-time grab-and-go favorite, hands down.""

"20120321","5.0","Beyond awesome!","I love this camera. I had the previous model purchased back in 2009 and I still do. This one has improved on what was already a great camera. If you are looking for a decent priced semi-professional camera, this is it. It has awesome zoom and the 14.1 megapixel is a plus. I love being able to take pictures in situations where smaller digital cameras cannot (for example in a graduation). The zoom allows you to get close pictures without the grainy images. I should mention that this is not a typical fit in your pocket camera. However, its size is what makes it stand the middle ground between small cameras and the professional DSR. I really enjoy it versatility. I have now taken pictures in just about every mode and they come out great, even at night in Las Vegas. The sports mode should also get honourable mention. In short, it's a great buy.""
"20120319","3.0","Great for stationary shots, but limited in action","I've taken some beautiful photos indoors and out with this camera.  As light goes down, artifacts (picture's overall blurriness) becomes a major issue on auto mode.  I have to use the flash when shooting in auto in low light.The preset settings are limited.  I had a $100 point and shoot Canon that had more settings.  There are major issues with blurry pictures of moving objects.  The only setting that works in high resolution is pets, and even that is far from perfect.  The continuous burst mode works great for sporting and action sequences, but there are a high rate of artifacts and I would only recommend in high light settings.Video works great and is truly 720 HD.  The auto focus is great when you're in a hurry to start a shoot. The only drawback is that you can hear the zoom lens if adjusted during a quiet shoot.Would I buy this camera again?  Not at full price, but for a 21X zoom HD video camera, it was worth two benjamins.""
"20120314","2.0","Poor choice for indoors or for non-stationary subjects (I get blurry pics no matter what I use for settings)","I took well over 300 pictures using many combination of settings (auto, scene modes, VR, flash, ISO, etc) at my daughters indoor dance show and unfortunately was not able to find a setting that is going to work acceptably for this situation (indoor, medium light). I found that VR on this camera didn't seem to help much at all if there is much movement in the subject. I also was not able to get pictures of my kids at a birthday party that are acceptable - there is some level of blurriness in almost all of the shots.I thought I was having some success with the sports mode (those pics looked Ok on the LCD), but once transferred to the PC, they were unacceptable, even though I used the highest resolution available. I see that Nikon even suggests a different camera for people wanting good indoor or low light photo capability in their recent advertising, so even they don't recommend this model for indoor pics.So this camera seems good for outdoors with lots of light, when taking photos of stationary objects or landscapes. But things with movement just aren't working out for me. I returned it since my previous Panasonic SZ7 outperforms this L120 (I was also A/B'ing the two).I was also not happy with the clarity of the pictures - they seem a bit off even on stationary objects with lots of light, almost like the autofocus does not work really well. After reading other reviews, it seems that others are also having problems with blurriness indoors or with pictures of people too, so I guess I'm not alone on this.Also note that it is possible that my L120 was defective - I just can't believe so many people are giving such good ratings for the most part based on the types of pictures mine gave before I returned it. And I am actually a test engineer by profession and am certain I was setting things up correctly when I did my trials with it, so possibly my camera was defective since I could not get good pictures with it no matter what I did.

I am going to write this review now after testing it for a day and I will do like some others and continue to add updates periodically if anything noteworthy comes up.  Now for the details.  If you are looking for a PnS camera with P,S,A,M controls (aperture, shutter speed, etc) then this camera is NOT for you.  This camera is for one group, the folks that want to turn it on, push the button and get a good photo (my wife is in this group!).  There is absolutely nothing to learn about the camera.  You put in the 4 batteries, the memory card, and turn the power on.  Even the most photo ignorant person could figure out the functionality without ever consulting an instruction manual.  The 'scene selection' button will bring up a menu of 4 main categories.  1. Easy Auto Mode (for those who only want to know the power button and shutter button), 2. A large assortment of scenes (portrait, landscape, Sunset, closeup, and many more), 3. Continuous SPORT mode (I was VERY impressed with this mode), 4. Auto mode (with the ability to change the normal PnS stuff like white balance, ISO, flash, and a few others).The setting I had to try first was the Sport Continuous mode.  I was VERY impressed with this mode.  Does it equal my D90 shooting with my 2.8 70-200? no, but the quality is VERY good for a PnS camera.  We have the Canon SD700, SD750 and SD800 and none of these would even come close to capturing what the L120 did.  To compare image quality I used the L120 and my D90 with a Sigma 18-200 OS.  I shot the flowers on a tripod.  I shot the little girl handheld.  I tried to frame the same shot at the same distance with both cameras.  This is not a lab test so it is not perfect.  I simply wanted to compare the $900 SLR with a $400 lens to the $275 PnS.  The quality of the L120 was pretty amazing.  I am going to post the images of both cameras in the product images above so you can see them.The initial cons I found are: I don't like the SD card and batteries being in the same compartment.  The battery door is not very easy to open and close.  I also found a few of the buttons a little easy to accidentally push until I get the camera situated in my hand.  It is however, very comfortable to hold.I have not even tried the video and all the various scene selections.  I just began snapping pictures and then looked at them in photoshop compared to my D90 photos.  I did not have to do alot of testing to see that I was very pleased.  I will post more as we use it and I have informative info to add.  I can say ditto to the many many positive ratings for this camera.UPDATE 05/22/11 : I am finding the still the photos to still be outstanding.  However, the sport photos have been somewhat of a challenge.  In the scene selection you can only choose 'Sport Continuous'.  The part I don't like is that while you hold the button down it will take multiple photos.  Then when the shutter button is released, it will complete the 'write to card' process (I have ordered a class 10 card to see if that speeds up the write process).  In a normal DSLR camera, you would continue to track the person you are photographing and keep shooting if a shot is there.  The L120 is used to capture a 3-5 second span and then it will write to the card.  While it is writing to the card, you will NOT see anything on the LCD and therefore you would have lost the subject.  When using my D90, I would continue to track the person I am photographing and continue to shoot.  That is just not feasible with the L120 (i.e. track, or any sport where they are running in a somewhat straight line).  You just simply capture a 3-5 second time frame and have multiple shots of that moment in time.  The picture quality is not as good when trying to pan the camera and capture a moving target.  When I am so used to being able to make all my changes manually, it is somewhat hard for me to use this camera and have no control other than selecting the appropriate scene from the menu.  As I stated in my original review, this camera is designed for the aperture ignorant use who simply wants to turn on the camera and take a picture.  At my kids' field day, I found out after importing the images that they were all shot in 640 pixels!!!  I have no idea how she (my wife) changed that but she or someone did.  That rendered the photos useless for print.  I fixed it but it was too late.  This was only for the 'Sport Continuous' mode that I had the resolution problem.  When she had 'auto' or 'portrait' mode selected, the image size was normal.  There is a setting in the 'Sport Continuous' mode that allows you to change the image resolution for just that mode and anything less than the largest size is going to be too small to print anything decent.UPDATE 05/25/11: I am very sorry to say that I am growing increasingly unhappy with this camera.  I mostly take outside pictures and in good light it has done really well, especially landscape pictures.  However in low light I finding that it really stinks.  A REALLY major problem is that the flash will NOT auto popup if needed (even if you have it set to 'auto').  The flash must be raised manually and then it will fire if you have it set correctly.  Most of my initial images were in my normal outdoor setting.  But once we began to use the camera indoors at the recent end of the year school functions, it has been a big disappointment.  I guess the real question is this.  Is there any PnS camera out there that will perform well in relatively low to medium light situations.  I am really considering calling Adorama and seeing if this can't be exchanged for something else.  I have already mentioned that I don't like the door for the battery and SD card.  I hate it even more.  It is very hard to open and close.  Finding out that it goes thru batteries fairly quickly too.  Oh well....""

"20110508","5.0","Great photos","I bought this Nikon over a month ago and have already taken over 1,000 photos on it. All I can say is wow. First of all the battery life for me was great. I was not to keen on the 4 AA batteries that were required to be used because i never had good luck with that type of camera. My first set of batteries that I used took over 600 photos and that is using the flash most of the time. The zooming on this is great. Now when there is a really far zoom, don't expect it to be top notch photo but the anti-shacking option on this camera helps with the far photo shots. I have a 16 gig SD card in mine and with the max mp turned on to 14.1 i am able to get over 4,000 photos on one card. Now the photos, it really does a good job for a point and shoot camera. It does take some time to learn the camera but there are two settings that make it much easier to use. One is the easy mode, and the other is the Auto mode. Both are good for starters or just to get a good couple quick shots off. Attached are a few photos I have taken with this camera in all different light conditions. I hope this helps everyone that want's to find a good point and shoot camera with good zoom and good photo quality.""

"20110507","3.0","Too much green color in the Nikon L120 outdoor photos?","I just purchased a Nikon L120 from Amazon. I tested it in a nice day outdoor, taking photos of an open space view with hills, trees and a beautiful sky.The L120 camera is a nice camera, overall. However,all my outdoor photos come out with too much green in the photos. I am not sure if this is just the way Nikon L120 is, or is there some problems with the sensors of this particular camera.I went back to my old camera, Kodak Z650, to take duplicate photos of the same view, just for comparison purposes.Comparing the two sets of photos side by side, the blue sky in the Z650 photos definitely are more true to the real life sky color. The L120 photos have way too much green in the photo.I also notice that there is noticeable LESS red/brown color in the L120 photos, compared to the Z650 photos, which causes the L120 photos to appear too green.I am wondering if there is a way I can reduce the sensitivity of L120 on green and enhance its red/brown?Or should I send the camera back, assuming that there is some problem with the camera?""
"20110506","5.0","Terrific camera for the $","My old Nikon was 2003 vintage Coolpix 885 and great back then but the menu had died in it soconsidering trying to get it fixed vs getting a new camera, I shopped around.I'm glad I did. This Camera has only one flaw if it can be called that, the lens cover isn't quite as good as the one for my older model. It does however come with a tiny cord to attach it to the camera which was cool! No more setting it down and then looking for it. You need to be careful installing the batteries properly. I ought a couple of the Transcend 16 gb memory cards through Amazon. Walmart had a 4 pack of their Lithium best AA batteries so I bought and used them. I popped them in, popped in a memory card and then had to read the book to see how to turn it on and WHAM! I was taking pics. You can edit them real easy right in the camera as I tested it on my wife getting out of the shower who immediately demanded I remove them. I did.The menu is now intuitive and easy to maneuver compared to my Nikon Coolpix 885.I really do need to read the book though since this camera has outstanding features. The picture quality, I can't believe how good it is.The larger screen is really really nice. The software I had already tried with my older camera. I love it. You get the manual on a CD along with a cd with the software. The Macro which another poster mentioned is just great and one of the reasons I bought this one. I bought a $7 Zeikos case for it and it's perfect.I'm as tickled as I can be. I was hesitant at first spending more for it than other brands, but my experience with my previous Nikon Coolpix 885 already leaned me towards this one. It's really well packed in it's box complete with cables and straps and 4 Energizer AA alkaline batteries. Being able to get batteries at Walmart is a huge plus. You can buy rechargeable ones with a charger as well.What's not to like? I spent the extra $ and am 100% completely satisfied.I'm so satisfied that now I'm going to try seeing if I can get the 885 menu restored through Nikon and give that camera to my niece as it still does take great pics......but not like this unit does.OH yes, and I DO like the fact it's a bit larger than other compact models.It easier to hold it steady since I grew up with a lot bigger older cameras.We're buying some property with outstanding views and I can't wait to take pics with this camera to share with family and friends.""

"20110504","3.0","Nikon Coolpix L120 -  poor directions for memory card","I got this camera and rushed out to buy a memory card (PNY), not knowing that this camera is so sensitive that you should only use one of 4 recommended cards.  Well, you guessed it, I bought the wrong one, but it had automatically formatted card so no problems to this point.In the middle of the directions that are on User's Manual CD (but not in the quick start guide) I saw they are recommending different cards -- San Disk, Toshiba, Pansonic & Lexor.  Then I buy an extra card (San Disk)for this long trip I'm going on with my new camera.  Put this one in the camera to checked it out, and boom! the camera freezes in a loop of trying to format the card.Nikon technician told me about the camera sensitivity to card when I called...that the wrong card could damage the camera from 1 day to 1 year after loaded. So why wasn't this in BIG RED LETTERS IN THE GUIDE??  Camera can be fixed but not before my big trip, so back it went!""

It's amazingly easy to use, takes GREAT pictures, and the video feature is the best.  I love how easy it is to record video with this camera.  And the mic picks up sound easily.  The only thing I would add to this camera is a volume control to boost up the sound when taking video.  My husband likes the 20X zoom feature.  Brings everything right to you.  I would totally recommend this camera to anyone thinking of upgrading their point and shoot.  This camera is well worth the price.""

"20110429","3.0","It's good, but it could have been better.","I've used over 30 different cameras in the past 5 years, once upon a time, I used a Nikon F3 and an F4 photo cameras, so I know camera's pretty well.  I would have to say this camera is an entry level camera for it's high powered zoom.  It's about $40 over priced.  It has some basic features, that are handy, but really it has a serious lack of picture control for someone looking for P, S and Custom modes.  But if you are the average consumer this is an easy, semi affordable camera with a whoppin 21x zoom!!! 14 mp is good too.  I was not overly impressed with the panorama mode, not that many people use this feature, but basically when you do a panorama with many other camera's it helps you take the photo, then stitches things together for you.  This camera however, helps you take the photos but they remain unstitched, which may be a good thing for those who want to stitch it themselves.Overall I would say, this is a good camera, but not a great one.  Not the once in a lifetime find one was hoping for lol.  I would have rather seen a 219 price tag on these, but I guess they're compensating for a 21x lens.DON'T TAKE YOUR CAMERAS TO THE BEACH, ESPECIALLY ON A WINDY DAY!!! I tell people that all the time, but I am constantly seeing people taking their cameras to the beach, and coming back with a jammed lens, This camera, will have the same issue, if you do take it, block it from tiny particles, it doesn't take much, and for heavens sake, don't lay it down for a moment.""

"20110426","3.0","Loved it - but returned it","Bought this camera and loved the ease of operation and picture quality. I also have the Panasonic DMC-FZ35, which is VERY complicated. I needed something simpler. I learned to use this Nikon after only 1 hour of reading the manual (compared to months still trying to figure out the Panasonic). Was easy getting great pictures. Smile detection and Pet mode worked terrific. Unfortunately, my primary reason for this type of hybrid camera, is for the convenience of camera and HD video in one unit. Video quality on this unit is well below average. I compared it to my Panasonic - no comparison. The Panasonic's video was smooth and clear, the Nikon - grainy and jerky. I really wanted to keep this camera for it's ease of use and picture quality, but the poor video quality ultimately caused me to return it. Until I find an easy to use camera with good picture and video, I'll continue with the months of trying to figure out the Panasonic.PROS: Ease of use, great pictures, smile detection, pet mode, easy to understand manual, price.CONS: Poor video quality""
"20110425","5.0","A solid performer with some minor quirks","I purchased the Nikon L120 about a month ago in preparation for a trip we were taking to California.  Although I was impressed by several of the features I read about, such as the extended zoom and pseudo-dslr design, I still had some concerns about a couple of features such as the complaints about focusing and lack of manual controls.  After shooting about 200 pictures, I am happy to report that I will be keeping the camera.I'll address my concerns about the reported concerns others expressed.  First was the concern over focus.  At one point, the camera was having trouble focusing on a shot of the sea and horizon.  Everything was blurry and only items within 20-30 ft. would be in focus.  I tried several different modes, including landscape and beach, but it did not cure the problem.  At that point, I decided to just turn it off and turn it back on and that solved the problem.  There must be some issue with the algorithms which pick certain items to focus, but the old 'off and on' trick fixed it and I had no other problems, even under similar circumstances.  The other issue was of the lack of manual modes. Except for the focus issue, I had no problems with exposure under any conditions, inside, outside, bright lights, dim, flash, portraits, etc.Now onto the good things.  Battery life is very good.  I took over 200 pictures  with regular alkaline batteries. Although I had lithium batteries ready to go, it has not been necessary to use them.  With battery life that good and the fact that it uses 4 AA batteries, I don't think I'll go to the expense of lithium batteries.I really like the form factor of the camera.  The bulge on the right side is very handy and you can hold it securely with only a couple of fingers.  Taking the lense cap on and off is annoying, especially when you forget to take it off after  you power it up.  However, it's no more annoying than it was in the old days of analog cameras.  Also with the plain old lense cap, there are no concerns with sand jamming up exterior shutters.  The camera is too large to fit in your shirt pocket but not too big to fit in a coat pocket or purse/backpack.  I think it's an acceptable compromise on size.  Zoom is excellent.  Seals which were several hundred yards away looked like we were right on top of them.  I did not experience any shutter lag, although I have not used the camera in burst or sports mode yet.  Video mode is about what  you would expect for a hand held camera.  OK, not great, but works well enough for that quick video when you need more than a still camera.To sum it up, I like the battery life, picture quality, good assortment of modes, adequate flash range and fantastic zoom.  The camera definitely has a few quirks but ones I decided I can live with.  I give it a solid  9 out of 10.""
"20110425","5.0","GREAT POINT AND SHOOT, CAMERA CAN DO MUCH MORE IF YOU WISH!!!!","I didn't want to spend the money on an SLR, since I largely don't have the patience for instruction manuals and technical maneuvering.

"20110423","4.0","over all performance","I'm not a professional with camera's but I've used them for about 35 years, since I started using my Dad's 35MM split frame and developing the film myself. Now, The Nikon COOLPIX L120 14.1 MP camera is very easy to work and use and has that Professional feel about it. It takes great photo's and focus is fast.  The only draw back about it that I do not like is that it uses AA batteries and if you do not get the RIGHT kind, than the camera will not work at all, but than again, you can always get batteries where ever you happen to be and take extra's with you while traveling or out for the day.""
"20110421","5.0","By far the best choice!","For anyone looking at getting a decent, mid-level point-and-shoot with the look and feel of an SLR, the Nikon Coolpix L120 is by far the best choice, even with its few shortcomings!As a semi-professional photographer who primarily shoots film (but is slowly converting to digital) I always have kept at least a digital P&S camera with me to get those 'quick' shots that I can't get because of the time involved in setting up the shot in an SLR. My previous camera, the Minolta DiMAGE S414 had been getting long in the tooth and was starting to glitch. A friend gave me his Nikon Coolpix E5200 and I was immediately hooked on Nikon's legendary imaging quality. However, the 5-megapixel sensor in the Coolpix E5200 was short of what I truly needed, so the same friend who gave me the E5200 also let me try out his Coolpix L110. I was blown away with how well the photos turned out! In my quest to buy my own Coolpix L110, I had heard back in February that Nikon was releasing the Coolpix L120, with a 2-megapixel increase over the L110 and several new features. Having read the first reviews of the camera, it seemed like a sure winner, so I took the plunge on March 14th of this year and secured one for myself.Instantly, I was hooked on it. Right out of the box, this camera is a winner! The settings, user-interface, the sleek design and the nifty zoom selector on the lens barrel makes this camera worth every penny. In the short time I have owned it, I have already taken approximately 1,200 photos with it; everything from nature, bridges, even the sun! (with a solar filter, of course). And with its fantastic 21x optical zoom, I can photograph a car at more than a quarter-mile away and be able to clearly read its license plate!The only drawback I can see is that Nikon has left out the ability to manually control your aperture and shutter speed settings (instead, leaving that for the Nikon Coolpix P500 which I was unimpressed with). However, those small shortcomings are overwhelmed by the simplicity this camera offers. Itching to get into Panorama photography, without the need for an expensive SLR with built-in panorama stitching? Consider it done! With this camera's Panorama-Assist feature (which overlays a small portion of the image onto the screen for the next shot to be composed), and the supplied Arcsoft Panorama Maker Pro 5 software, Panorama-style photography has never been more affordable. Looking to enhance photos with HDR-like color clarity? Consider that done, also! This camera supplies with it built-in D-Lighting that preserves the color intensity of an image yet bringing out the details otherwise hidden within dark shadows. Also supplied, incase you don't want to edit your images in-camera, is Nikon's own View NX-2, which not only includes D-lighting enhancement filters, it also offers a host of other image-editing capabilities!In short, this camera has the competition beat! I would recommend it (I have the black version) over anything else.""
"20110420","5.0","EXELLENT CHOICE  for an Upscale Point and Shoot Camera.","Although this camera looks like a SLR Camera it is not, it is however an excellent point and shoot camera with some features you would find on a more expensive SLR for quite a bit less money.  If you are an amateur photographer with some basic knowledge of photography, this feature rich camera might just be the camera for you.I was looking for a camera that looked good like a SLR, had a great zoom, fairly easy to use and could get off multiple shots fast and of course produced some good end results. This camera so far has done it all plus some. I did not realize there where so many features on this camera until I put there CD in my PC and downloaded  all there material.Instead of me trying to explain everything about the camera I have found a wonderful United Kingdom web site that has done an excellent extremely detailed review on this camera. It has pages of review on all aspects of it plus photos and video taken with this camera. Much more thorough than I could ever be.  Just go to ' photographyblog.com ' and in there review section type in Nikon Coolpix L120 Camera for there review.I put some zoom photos that I took on the product page. These where taken the 1st day I got the camera. The photo,s of the Loquat tree are the actual 1st and 2nd photos I took with this camera. I will be adding new photos as I get more familiar with it. So far I like the Nikon L120 very much with a few small exceptions.  Not quite a 5 star camera but closer to 5 than 4 stars. So 5 stars it is for now since it is doing most everything I expected it to do when I ordered it.PS ::: I have the red version and love it.  Definitely a sharp, eye catching camera.

"20110328","5.0","Finally a digital designed like a 35mm","I recieved this camera just a couple of days ago. Wow what a fantastic surprise! My two previous digital cameras were a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ10 which I purchased in 2009 for a bicycle tour. While the camera had a lot of good things going for it a couple of problems stuck out which I could not tolerate. 1st and foremost it was very poor in bad lighting and the flash did not compinsate. 2nd..it really needed to be held steady any movement created a blurry picture. Declining light only made the issue worse. My other digital is a Nikon Coolpix 4300 which I bought 6 or 7 years ago to handle an online website. I love that camera, great pictures. good in bad light, not much zoom capability but could deal with that. The big problem...It was designed with an odd memory card which is hard to get and did not hold as much as comparable cameras today. I still use this camera for my website.Good luck with Nikon and poor luck with Lumix I decided to chance another Nikon. Wow again..quick focus, Holds a common SD card, great zoom capabilities, and best of all it opperates very well in poor light conditions, in fact I forced a poor light condition under my desk with no flash and worked beyond belief! Add to those good reviews the fact they have redesigned the zoom key and placed it on the left side on the lens (can you say 35mm like)long, long, long over due.If your thinking about one...make the plunge. A+A+A+""
"20110323","5.0","Just love it!","I couldn't wait until this camera was released and it was worth the wait!  I love how it looks, the bronze is beautiful, and it sits well in my hand.  It felt comfortable from the very first holding.  I like how the lens cap attaches--can never get lost, but not in my way either.  Easy to use right out of the box.  After reading the comments on it's predecessor the Nikon L100 and L110, I did two things immediately.  I used fresh lithium batteries instead of the ones it came with, and I, after a few too many blurry photos, upped the ISO.  The photos are fabulous so far!  I am enjoyed playing around with the black and white setting and got some stunning results, just from sitting in my chair indoors, focising on ordinary items and my dog in my living room!  I'm having fun experimenting with the different settings in the menu and recently took some very interesting night shots on my street. Macro is stunning.  I found some great cases at Target and Walmart, but the one I bought fits so nicely is a small Lowenpro, it was under $20 with room enough for the camera with strap, and a little pouch for an extra set of batteries. I cannot comment on the video, as I have not used this feature yet.  I've only had this bronze beauty for two weeks but so far I am very impressed!""

"20120301","4.0","Stylish and reliable mid level camera","I recently returned home after taking my relatively new Nikon L120 red on a 3 weeks long trip to India. Without knowing much about its full capabilities, I was able to experiment in the moment and still get some amazing pictures. Not all but most. I liked the sport mode for taking pictures while in a moving car and for far away images of the street from the rooftop of one of the hotels In which I stayed. I was able to see great details from pretty far away even beyond the camera's yellow bar indicating the focus was AF.One of my main gripes from my experience was the sunrise/sunset mode and taking pictures at dusk of the many colors and faces which and who graced our early morning and evening walks. The flash was a bit much and made images a little garish, something I was able to somewhat address with some editing software but I am not a big flash fan anyway and would rather not use it. The shutter ended up being open too long. Some pictures with the blurry looked arty while others were throwaways, er, deletes. And I agree with another reviewer who mentioned the annoying lens cap as well as losing precious time if I turned on the camera without first removing it.But my #1 gripe is that it used AA batteries and it is one hungry beast. I could not use rechargeables and I went through so many batteries it was embarrassing. I wish it had a NiCad battery which would not only reduce environmental waste but the charge would last longer. No one likes hauling a 36 pack around in one's day pack. Based on that my next camera purchase will definitely have an internal battery charge feature.I  think if I spent a little more time learning about the L120 and anticipating its peculiarities my next set of adventure photos will be that much better. Recommended with the suggestion of using it as much as possible before setting off on your once in a lifetime experience. :)))3.5 stars.""
"20120229","5.0","easy to use; great pics","I am not a professional photographer, but I needed something that could zoom better than my little point and shoot. This camera takes good pictures, has great zoom and is easy to use. Exactly what I wanted.""
"20120223","5.0","UP UP and AWAY","I read many of the reviews on this camera but have been using the smaller cool pix cameras for a year now and wanted a little more macro.  We photograph tinny tinny beads and the original cool pix that we bought had already replaced our 6 meg Pentex and heavy macro lenses(state of the art when we bought it). Nikon was one of the first to offer macro in a point and click I wanted to see how they improved and boy did they.  I am pulling more detail in all my photos we also added the CowboyStudio Table Top Photography Studio Lighting Tent Kit. Between the 2 WOW.  Some of the reviews I read were about blurry pictures and people were really unhappy so keep in mind our review is for those close up still shots. The cool pix dose take a little time to learn because they have many extra setting you can use and ours is always set for close up macro shots. For the best photos with this camera play with the green settings button and try them all out to find the setting that work best for your application we have been able to shoot indoors with minimal light (usually happens when I'm carrying the camera back to the computer to download and well take a picture of my feet, the wall, or the dog snoring ya know the ops I bumped the button again shot). If I were talented and didn't shake so bad I would probably go back to a professional camera but for our needs the quality is what we need. Thank you Nikon cant wait to see what you do next year.""

"20120209","1.0","A Nikon Miss","I bought the L120 to replace my Canon PowerShot A650 IS that I use when I'm hiking, because my slr cameras are too big and heavy to carry all day.  I thought that I was up grading, but after using it for the last three months I'm finding out that I was wrong.  One reason that I bought it was because it uses AA batteries.  When I'm out in the middle of no where I can't stop and charge batteries.  I'm on the second set of batteries.  A set of batteries would last me about a year in the Canon.It is a nice camera and takes great pictures part of the time, but the zoom works to fast and it is hard to stop it where you want it.  The vibration reduction isn't great.  It is almost impossible to use in bright sunlight or to follow a moving subject.I'll keep using it, because I made the mistake of buying it, but I'll probably be using my old Canon more.  I like Nikon and have several Nikon and Canon slr cameras.  This is the first small Nikon that I have bought.  I think that they sure made a mistake with this model.  I don't recommend it at all.""

We need to purchase it separately. 3) Picture quality is not like DSLR neither it is like Nikon P500, its just below that level. But good  4) Need to click photos by seeing through big screen which took battery life.Well Thats it.If in future, if I did photography course and if I become faster in adjustment of lenses and effects, I will not buy this product.

"20120125","5.0","Where have you been all my life?","I'm not a professional photographer although as many photos I take daily I should be one. I have hundreds maybe thousands photos saved through the years. I take pictures of everything, I mean even food, drinks or anything at all to 'document' our life. I carry a digital camera and a video camera with me in my purse at all times so I'm always ready to snap a photo or two. I have been a true fan of Olympus cameras, thats all I ever had since they ever started making digital cameras I still have their first model from about 15 years ago. My camera got very slow to the point that I was barely able to use it. My photos were blurry and I needed a new camera. After carefully readng reviews I decided to order this Nikon L120 and I have to say it is everything I ever wanted: I wanted to take amazing photos and capture life. Check out the photo above I uploaded of Derek jumping in the air (which is just about a second) and this camera clearly captured it even in Night mode! I love the wide angle and the zoom, it's very easy to switch scenes, the camera itself is very fast, reboots fast after turning on, I love the large LCD and even on Easy Auto mode the photos are clear and true in color. Oh, and there is a Pet mode scene, when you take a picture of a cat you can literally see the fur and the small eyelashes of the cat in such detail I was never able to get from a point and shoot before.

"20120122","4.0","Great in Every Way But...","Like many other owners, I did research and selected this camera based on feedback and Consumer Report info.  My previous camera is an Olympus, and I was reluctant to buy another camera because it was such a positive experience, but the camera started acting weird with the memory cards and they are no longer available.  The Nikon is great.  I am not going to repeat what everyone else has said about its features.  I have not used the video.  Not really a video person(except on my ipad2). So, overall, great camera. BUT, Nikon really missed the boat when they put the battery/memory card slot on the bottom together.  What's that about?  Every time I go to take out the memory card, I have to turn the camera upside down and leave it that way so the batteries do not fall out.  Locking the 'door' is a real pain.  No longer can I stand in place and remove my card and insert it in the slots.  Before, I could open the slot door, pop out the card, and when finished, pop the card in and close the door. Done. No messing with the batteries or holding the camera a certain way.  With the NIKON model, it's like handling glass. Awkward. I prefer to take the card out and view the pictures through the sD slot rather than connecting the camera to the computer with a cord.For me, that is the negative part of owning this camera.  Would I recommend it?  Yes, but I would definitely point out this feature. The pictures are great, the choices are many, and the results are pretty awesome for this type of camera.""

"20120110","5.0","Great little Nikon!","I purchased this camera at a warehouse club for a considerable discount.  I purchased it not knowing it took AA batteries; if I did I probably would have passed on it, which would have been a big mistake.  It takes excellent pics and very good vids due to the excellent Nikkor lens. Yes, it is mostly plastic, but that does not effect the performance at all.  Being less than a pound, even with the batteries, I have no problem carrying it around for all-day shooting. All the controls are pretty much standard to most point-to-shot cameras nowadays.  Contrary to a few comments made, I like the fact the flash has to be activated.  There is nothing more annoying then to have to fiddle with a menu to turn the flash off, or for auto flash, etc.  The only con I have is that the zoom is in steps and is pretty slow, but I guess that is a cost saving item.  All-in-all, I am very pleased with the L120 and would recommend it to anyone who wants a more advanced point-and-shoot camera for a tad over $200.""

"20111229","2.0","Disappointed","I bought this the Coolpix L120 for my wife for Christmas. I was intrigued by the optical zoom and the Nikon name. I am familiar with Nikon's SLRs, and have used L110s at work.First, the L120s body feels plastic and flimsy in comparison to the L110. Not sure what the difference is or why that would be, but the L110 seems sturdy and well put together. The L120 feels like a dressed up camera from some brand you've never heard of but found for a really good deal at a flea market.Second, to its credit the L120 performed admirably outside. The images were crisp and clear with good color balance. The L110s I've used were done so primarily outdoors, so this is not a surprise.Third, the L120 performed horribly and inconsistently indoors. For example, sitting at my kitchen table I set the camera to auto. I then snapped two pictures, one after the other. One looked fine, but the other had a horrible yellow tint to it. No flash was used for either photograph, the same settings were used, and there were no lighting changes, just click and click. What that's about is beyond me.Fourth, as mentioned above the L120 performed inconsistently. I took a series of photographs of my wife with the L120. Some were focused and clear, others were slightly blurry, and others looked as if I Photoshopped my wife into the picture. Other photos were grainy, much like those produced by my 7-year old, 3 megapixel Sony point and shoot that cost roughly 1/3 of the L120.Fifth, other complaints include an awkward menu system, a 'hidden' stabilization option in that my wife found it, but it certainly isn't in an obvious place and could not be found by me without looking in the manual, a lack of something as basic as a manual option, use of weird terminology in 'sports' mode menu, and probably a few other things I've forgotten.Overall, I would not recommend this camera. It's not worth the money - even at Amazon prices. I am entirely disappointed. I don't understand how a company like Nikon would attach their name to such a subpar product. The presence of a 21x optical zoom does not make up for other, glaring shortcomings. Needless to say we're sending this one back.""

"20111224","4.0","Surprised me and I'm loving it.","After much hemming, hawing and checking out reviews I decided to purchase the Nikon L120 bridge camera.  It's not exactly a point and shoot camera but it's not fully a DSLR either.  It's caught somewhere in-between helping you get comfortable with using features on the DSLR and still have the simplicity of a point and shoot camera.  The surprises came when I started to use it.  I had my heart set on buying a Nikon D90 but those are going for $600+ on Ebay (crazy!).  So that was out of my reach but I had seen this one before at Target and there was a deal at Wal-Mart and I figured let's try it out, worse comes to worse I'd return it.  I'm glad I kept it and this is why.Surprise #1, It runs on regular AA's, 4 to be exact.  You can use rechargeable but it comes with 4 Energizer AA's.Surprise #2, It has an internal memory.  Most digital cameras do not have that.  I found this out when I took pictures of my mother in front of the Christmas tree when she was all dolled up and realized after she got undressed that my SD card was still in my laptop.  I pressed the image preview button on the camera and the images were there.  Strange I thought but I took a chance and plugged it into my laptop and was able to download the images from the camera's internal memory.  Whew, was I happy to have not lost those pictures.Surprise #3, The setting for kids and sports.  I used it on the Macy's animated Christmas window display.  They had things moving and I wanted to capture that and I took the picture of the window and the lens shut and delayed for a second or two.  I figured it was going to be blurry and I moved on without looking at the photo.  Later I looked at the image and saw that the camera had taken 3 separate images of the moving image in the window display and when you put them all together it was the doll moving.  It looked very cool and in focus and I couldn't believe it had done that in that short amount of time.Surprise #4, the focus can be controlled on the lens or on the click button.  It takes getting use to using the one on the lens but it gives my left-hand something to do besides holding the camera.  The focus itself is great.  I know there have been complaints about blurry images but that's the beauty of a digital camera.  You take a blurry image you'll know right away to erase it and take another one.  Haven't had a chance to take images of the full moon or stars but that will be the first order of business in the spring.  I'll really be able to test the focus then.The cons are why I can't rate this a 5-star camera.Con #1: The flash won't come up in auto-focus unless you pull it up.  Annoying.Con #2: Hate the lens cap.  It dangles and gets in the way and I always forget to take it off before I turn on the camera.  I know it protects the lens but it's a nuisance.I've taken photography classes to learn the nuts and bolts of photography.  I've had a Nikon N65 for years and a Canon point and shoot for years.  I came to hate the Canon and it's limitations and there were many.  I loved my Nikon N65 for it's fast shutter speed but it was a film camera and I wasted more film and money on bad shots than I did on good ones.  Plus the price of Nikkor lens were and still are outrageous.  I'm not a professional photographer and I don't want to be one.  I want to take photos of things that interest me, things I want to remember, family, friends, places and moments.  I want to take photos of what I like, period.  And so far, this camera has helped me do that this Christmas better than all the others I've had, including my favorite which is a Fujifilm camera.I've shared some images that I took in New York during 2011 Christmas time visiting the store's window displays.  They were taken with crowds of people all around, pushing and vying for a photo position.  They are not blurry or out of focus and IMHO pretty nice for a self-described 'one-notch above amateur photographer'.  In my opinion, anyone should always do their do diligence and read all the reviews, compare prices and features but give this one a try.  This is a bridge-camera not a DSLR.  It definitely looks like a DSLR but it's not.  It acts like a point and shoot camera but it's not.  Like I said at the beginning it's an in-between camera.  If you don't have some experience with SLR you will get pissed quickly.  If you have too much experience with SLR and looking for a DSLR you will be annoyed and get pissed quickly.  This is just my opinion and experience with Nikon's Coolpix L120 so take it for what it's worth and happy photo taking to all.""
"20111222","3.0","No image stability, not great with small kids","So I purchaced this yesterday from Best Buy, as it's three days before xmas and I need a camera to take pictures of my kids xmas morning!  I have a cannon powershot from 2007 that I loved, till it stopped focusing my pictures on me.  Grr.  I have always used a Cannon and Pentax 35 mm before that.  Yes, actual film.  So I was disapointed with reviews for current Cannon cameras so I looked at other brands.  Nikon is a reputaple brand.  I have also been taking photos for over 20 years now, been a proffesional photographer three times and worked in TV.  So I have a steady hand.  Having started with that.  This camera has many pros.it's not a bad size as a mid-level camera.  Not quite point and shoot, but not an DSLR either.  That's fine for me.It has an AMAZING zoom!  and many features for changing your settings if needed.  Takes an SD card.Downside.I'm used to AA's in my camera vs. the rechargable ones.  But it would have been nice.  I'm the type who needs to replace them, of course just in that important setting.  So I can go buy somemore, and done.  Vs.  It's dead, wait for it to recharge. It's a personal choice for the batteries.  Does add a bit of extra weight.  Again, a personal choice.Lens cap will bother some people.  I'm an old school user, so it doesn't bother me as much.The flash in auto mode for low light situations is only gonna come on if you pop the thing up to begin with.  Just FYI.  It won't pop up on it's own.  Little stupid in the design of the thing.The zoom.  Which yes I said was amazing.  And it is.  IF your zoomed in and it's on a tripod.  I zoom in on one of my kids, or dogs from across the room ( cause at 7 yrs and 15 months they don't hold still for long) and even if they are NOT moving, it still looks like someone hit my hand as I lightly touched the button!  OH I CAN'T STAND THAT!!!  IF I hold it down and it's foucus ( according to the manual ) and I press the button why is it so sensitive!!!!!  OMG.  It's much improved of course if your not zoomed it, but it still happend.  I tripoded the thing and lightly touched the button to take a picture of a non moving item ( my xmas tress) and it was still blurry.  ????  It only improved (greatly might I add) if the flash was up.  Which I don't understand cause I had plenty of light in my shot. And again, nothing was moving.  But it still looks like you slaped my hand last second while holding the camera.  This of course is with the image stabillity thing on.IF it were not for that I'd give it five stars.HOW can it be a 14 MP camera and so many features and be so sensitive???!!  Otherwise this would be an outstanding camera right out of the box.  I'm thankful I have a seperate video camera for xmas.  But I'm gonna play with the thing for a few more days.  Only because I want some pic for xmas ( something is better than nothing ) and maybe I'm missing something.  Maybe it's defective the over sensetivity thing.  I''ll update this again after xmas and give my final judgement.It has video but I haven't used it yet.  So unless someone else has the touchy movement thing also we shall see if it's just mine, or poor design on Nikons part.Great camera for settings and picture quality otherwise.  If focusing wasn't an issue right now, this would be an amazing camera.***UPDATE***So it's May 2012 now.I still think this thing is okay.  I will say yes to the person who said turn off the Image Stabilizer while on a tripod.  I knew that, and could have explained that nugget of wisdom better.  So thank you.  While I like the camera still, I don't love it for my kids or pets.  The best shots come when you have the flash up.  So if you have people that hate to be blinded they won't love you for this cammera.  I have to re-take some of people just because they blink.  The time you have to wait from when you take one picture, till you can snap the next one is SLOW.  It irritates the crud out of me!  SO MUCH!  I think that in proper lighting or being outside I should be able to snap a shot without having the flash up.  Even if it doesn't go off, it still takes a better picture then if I leave it down.  I find that irritating and retarded.  Don't get me wrong, my shots look GREAT otherwise!  I don't use it for video still.  Perhaps I'll test that out...  I just don't think this is a good camera for capturing small kids or pets.  Anything else, perfect.  Just spend time testing it out on things you don't NEED to have a picture of.  Get to know it's settings, what works best where.  READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, they do help.I use rechargable AA's in this.  I keep at least one/two sets charged and in my camera bag for when the set in the camera go.  I use less batteries that way, and they last just as long... and I'm snap happy!  It cost less in the long run to buy these kind up front vs. over the life of your camera, and all the ones you'll feed into it.Happy Snapping!""
"20111221","3.0","Pretty Good","This camera is pretty easy to use it is not really a point and shoot you need to know how to use it I had to contact someone that had one like this. The pictures are very blurry if you do not have the flash on. I do not like this at all. But it takes very good pictures when you have the flash up.""
"20111221","2.0","Pros and Cons...Mostly Cons, though.","I reluctantly purchased this camera despite the reviews being all over the place. I must say that if you are patient and are not using the zoom very much that the camera is not that bad; however why would one purchase a camera that has its features unusable? The zoom at great lengths is quite difficult to produce a blurry-free picture. The focus time increases as the zoom is extended - an issue NOT seen with most point and shoot cameras at the same distance and NOT an issue for the more expensive bridge cameras (ones like this that are not quite a DSLR, but not a point-and-shoot either). I know that most people are quite upset when a camera does not meet the standards or expectations they had, but you must really read the reviews, play with it at the store, and then make a sound decision about purchasing. I did all these steps and still ended up returning the camera less than 24 hours later because I did not want to 'settle'.If you are wanting an entry-level bridge camera for taking still shots and are quite patient with the focus and reload time, this camera will work for you. If you are looking for quick action shots, long zoom use and such, I would suggest staying with the point-and-shoot or upgrading to a compact camera or DSLR.A few things that might sway you one way or the other: the flash is a manual pop-up (good and bad), it takes AA batteries (I suggest buying rechargeable ones from Amazon - they're inexpensive here), it has small internal memory (not found very often in cameras now-a-days), plenty of scene options, easy menus.I hope this helps!""
"20111218","4.0","Great Point and Shoot, BUT","Bought this for my daughter as a step up from her small Nikon P&S....assumed it had a viewfinder, bit it does NOT so all shots must be made via the live view screen on back. Image quality is superb, and for the money it's a good buy.My mistake in researching this camera, also not as many manual options as i would have liked. Takes standard AA's though- always a plus, especially when traveling. Recommended, just be aware of what you're buying.""
"20111218","1.0","Totally Frustrated : ( !!","I got this camera as a gift and I am soooooo returning it ASAP! Definitely read ALL the reviews (pros and cons) and you will note the biggest concern is BLURRY photos. I have tried everything and bottom line, if I have to play around and waste time trying to make a camera work, then it's NOT worth it! Save your money and move FAR away from the Nikon Coolpix L120!""
"20111215","5.0","More than I expected","This camera is just the result of a company who cares about quality, market targets and solid products. If you want to compare this camera vs another brand you'll probably find thousand of points in your favor.. For me it turns out that this is the best camera I've ever order after my all life camera MAMIYA Professional with double focus.. The optical zoom is impressive and the quality picture resolution is something that amazing.. I'm not a pro and I feel like one everytime I take a picture. I recommend you to buy the extra memory cartridge in case you want to record videos. the navigation menu is easy to use. I'm very happy with my product.""
"20111214","4.0","Nice camera","It's a very nice and easy to use camera. But it only has 720P video recording capability. I am a little disappointed. Zoom range is BIG. Zooming speed control is a little too rough, not precise enough. Overall it's a well made camera.""
"20111214","1.0","Absolute Disappointment!!!","I second the review by Soapy's Mom. This camera is an absolute disappointment. Did all the research, it got great ratings and reviews....then what's the problem??? Every shot is blurry no matter what mode you use. Flash on or off, terrible shots. I just had a baby and the early shots turned out terrible. Back to using my compact Kodak that I hated before I bought this one. I seem to have bad luck with my camera purchase regardless of how hard I look to find a great one. It's not at all what I expected out of a Nikon. I am returning this camera.""
"20111213","4.0","Looks great..","After reading several reviews, I was torn between purchasing a Sony Nex 5 or a Nikon L120. I purchased the Nikon, but now i wonder..I was an amateur when I bought this, and honestly, I was amazed by how it looked. It looked sleek and and I thought it would take sharp photos-which it most certainly does, but it's missing that magical touch. I was aiming for background defocus because photos that have blurry background seemed amazing to me. When i take close-ups, the background is indeed out of focus, but when i take general photos, I can't get it to focus on the subject and leave the rest out of focus. I now realize i need something like a SLR, which is way out of budget for a 14 year old; yet, I am pleased with this camera compared to my old camera!If you are looking for a great point-and-shoot camera with brilliant zoom, than this is the camera for you!""
"20111211","5.0","great camera","I have not had the camera long enough to know everything about it.  It is good so far.  Everything we wanted.""
"20111208","5.0","Easy to use for great pictures!","I am a novice at photography and my main subjects are outdoors: birds, scenery, sometimes the occasional family get together. My new Nikon is replacing a larger and bulkier camera. It is easy to use and takes great pictures. I love the zoom on it, it really gets close to the action. It is lighter weight than my previous camera. I love the option of no flash. My previous camera would pop up and flash even though I had set it not to flash. The menus are easy to navigate and set your options. A great camera at a great price.""
"20111207","5.0","An Excellent Camera For The Money","I have given this camera a five star rating for what this camera is, a fully automatic SLR-type camera. If I would compare it with its more expensive brethern it would rate fewer stars. With that in mind the auotmatic function works for me. The exposure is on target. The 21X lens is fantastic for this price range. Also, the L120 takes AA batteries. That is a huge plus for me as they can be bought anywhere, even overseas. One can buy rechargeables and save some money. Ergonomically, this camera feels good in my hands. I would recommend this camera at its price point as it seems that these digital cameras only last a few years and repairing them is way expensive when they die. To me, it does not make sense to spend hundreds of dollars on a camera that is not easily repairable, becomes a relic in a short amount of time and becomes a throw-away.""
"20111206","2.0","Very blurry with indoor photos!","I purchased this camera because I liked all the photo settings and options.  While the pictures I have taken outdoors turned out pretty good, most of the indoor photos are garbage.  If you plan on taking pictures of people, especially kids, indoors with this camera don't bother.  Almost every picture I have taken of my kids is blurry, if something moves even the tiniest bit it will be blurry.  I've tried all the different settings with and without the flash and they still turn out blurry about 85% of the time.  I really wish I would have returned this camera within the returnable time limit from where I purchased it, unfortunately I didn't and I'm stuck with this camera.  I'm hoping I can save money to buy a different camera, this was a waste of my money.""
"20111204","1.0","sent back","I was looking for an easy to use camera that took great pictures. This camera doesnt take good pictures in low light. Pictures outside are fine (like any camera).

Had it repaired by Nikon 2 Times, the first time it took more then 7 weeks waiting on parts! I would buy a Cannon next time or go back to my old Fuji (inexpensive, but good value).""
"20111203","1.0","Uses AA batteries- very lame","I had no idea that this camera uses AA batteries- I know from past experience with digital cameras that AA batteries do not provide long use for cameras and as such I completely avoid cameras which do not have rechargeable batteries. I was very disappointed when I opened the box to find AA batteries! I immediately packed everything up and returned. Didn't bother testing the camera""
"20111203","5.0","Wonderful Camera!","This is a wonderful camera! It has everything I could have asked for in a small point-and-shoot. To be so compact, the full range of features offered are incredible. I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone. In fact, I already have.""
"20111202","1.0","Worst camera ever","We've had this camera for about half year now and I just hate it. It's OK for taking pictures outside in the daylight, but you can't do anything indoors. Doesn't matter what settings I do the pictures are blurry and colors look unnatural. Going back to my compact camera.""
"20111201","5.0","AWESOME. I LOVE IT","I have received my camera, and I really love it. Even thought I did not know that it works by AA batteries, its quality is excellent.It includes strap, LR6/L40 (AA size) alkaline battery x 4, USB cable, Audio video cable, lens cap, software CD-ROM, quick start guide, warranty and registration card.I will recommend it to my friends for sure!!!""
"20111130","5.0","Fantastic Camera","I bought the Nikon Coolpix L120 last month after much deliberation between buying a Nikon or Canon. As a magazine publisher, I wanted a camera that would give me SLR quality at a digital price for my casual photos. This was a great choice. I took a photo of a painting when the room was completely blacked out (dark) and with flash the photo came out clear as day. All my photographs are crisp and look lifelike when I zoom in on my photo viewer. The resolution is excellent!!! My one small issue is the image stabilization which is not in the lens but apart from that this camera is excellent. Worth every penny!!! Do not hestitate to buy it!!!""
"20111129","5.0","great camera for the price","I was looking for a camera with more zoom, easy to use & small enough to easily travel with, this camera meets all the criteria. I received this camera last week and from the pics I have taken it takes great pics of closeup photos of nature i.e. flowers, birds etc. I am a senior and I can say this camera was very easy to setup and easy to use. I would definitly recommend this to anyone. This is a great camera for its price!""

"20111128","2.0","Leaves You Fustrated!","I read all the reviews about this product, and I am a loyal Nikon customer, until now.  I have a DSLR Nikon D5100, loved the camera, but the size was uncomfortable.  So I went with the Nikon L120.  Big mistake.  This camera takes a good picture if you are a statue and never move.  The blur of every action picture, left me way to fustrated.  If I used the flash, everything went ok. But the flash is hardly necessary with every shot, and I have an active 4 year old, and 2 year old nephew.  This camera does not work for action pictures.  If you are steady enough, good luck I think everything will go okay.  But I'm used to being able to grab the camera and not worry about that.  Sorry Nikon, you have left me way to fustrated.  I have went elsewhere for my camera shopping.""
"20111128","5.0","Terrific Camera...  Great Price!","As an experienced DSLR photographer, I was looking for a small, easy to use camera for my wife and I for vacation travel. We've used our L120 for several weeks now and can offer only high praise for this outstanding camera.It is small and light enough to easily fit in a coat pocket, handles a wrist strap well, and feels comfortable and convenient in our hands. The battery life is fantastic, especially with 4 AA lithium batteries. The low light photos (without flash) are superb, even at ISO 100. The telephoto lens is exceptional at 25-525mm (35mm equivalent). We do use a Slik monopod to steady those long shots and get great results.Just read the brief Getting Started guide, select the AUTO setting for most situations, and then smile at your terrific photos. There is little the L120 doesn't do well. A truly superior camera at a very attractive price.""
