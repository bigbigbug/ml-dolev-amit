"20120114","1.0","Not the Product, the Deception","Actually, I bought one of these a while back that was DOA.  I notified Amazon and as usual was completely satisfied when the merchant mailed me a new one that works great. The problem I have with THIS listing, however, is the advertised price of $2.55 and in small letters you just might miss, the $5.95 for shipping and handling. That is outrageous, and Amazon needs to investigate the merchant trying to pull a fast one here on unsuspecting buyers who simply don't see the S&H levy. Also, if you think you can order more than one and just pay the $5.95, you're wrong. It's $5.95 per each item, regardless. In reality, you could mail, say, a couple dozen via USPS for no more than $2. SanDisk is a good product that has worked well for me in photo, video and audio applications. But $5.95 for shipping?  Just be honest like Amazon and the other reputable sellers and sell it for its $9 or so value.""

"20110809","5.0","High Quality, Economical 8 gb flash memory for still photography","The Sandisk brand of flash memory cards seems to be the best all-around quality. This particular card is a good value, I paid around $12 for it. It arrived in bulk packaging, meaning without a re-useable case. The newer Sandisk cards are black, so I assume this blue card is a year or two old model, but that's okay. I have had a few failures with Transcend and Kingston memory cards, but all of the Sandisk cards I own are still working, even the oldest ones. This Class 4 card will give adequate performance for capturing stills in any digital camera that uses SDHC cards, and it will capture Standard Definition (640 x 480) video. It might not be fast enough to record High Def video in some cameras, but in my Canon 60D, I have been able to shoot full HD videos up to three minutes long with no problems. This probably pushed the card to it's limits, as the User manual for the 60D clearly states that a Class 6 card is recommended as the minimum for HD video. A class 10 SD card is probably the best choice for HD video cameras, but beware of the cheaper Class 10 cards; some of these are labeled as Class 10, but don't actually deliver enough read/write speed for HD video.Note on HD video recording capacity and cost. My Canon 60D needs 355 megabytes, more or less, per minute of HD video, so an 8 gb SD card will hold only about 22 minutes worth of video clips, with 4 gb being the maximum size of any single clip. That's three 8 gb cards for 1 hour of HD video; cost is about $90 for class 10 cards. By comparison, the Canon HV-40 HD camcorder stores a full hour of HD video on a single Mini-DV tape that costs about $2.00, and there is no inherent limit other than the 1 hour length of the tape, on long a single video clip can be. In many ways, a camcorder like the HV-40 is much easier to use for shooting HD video than a DSLR like the Canon 60D; for one thing the HV-40 has continuous auto-focus, which the 60D does not. What this means is that video of moving subjects shot with the DSLR will likely have a much higher percentage of out-of-focus segments than a video of the same subject shot with a camcorder. Bottom line is that just because most modern DSLR's can shoot HD video, this doesn't mean that a DSLR is your best choice for video; if you shoot a lot of video, a camcorder is probably a better choice, and one that records on to an internal hard disk drive or mini-dv tape will certainly cost far less for the recording media than high speed flash memory for a DSLR. I own an HV-20 camcorder, and it's definately easier to get nice video clips with it than with a DSLR, especially of moving subjects at close distances.""

I've used them for more than ten years no and NEVER had an issue with them. Can't say the same about some others though. Just remember that the larger card will give you more record time and pictures, and the higher the number circled on the card, the faster it writes those images to the card. To the best of my knowledge (and I'm no expert for sure) they start at 4, go to 6 and at the moment top out at 10. The pro Series and Extreme Series may be rated higher. I'm not sure. But for the everyday user, these three will do.""

But the hassle of buying film, then taking it to the local drugstore to get them developed, became much to much to bare.  Many friends had suggested to me that I should get with the times when it came to photography, yet I continued using my old camera.  Once I purchased the digital camera and found out how completely easy it is to use, I purchased a larger capacity flash memory card for my camera.  I have had the most fun with my new camera.  I am a senior citizen, and when I go walking in the evening, I have taken as many as two pictures in an hour's time.

"20120502","4.0","SDHC Flash Memory Card","The product received was delivered in a timely fashion.  The memory card was sealed in the original factory packaging and functioned as specified.  The seller offered a good price for the memory card and well below local prices.  One thing that should be added to the product description is the difference between this memory card and the micro or smaller memory cards used in cameras and handheld scanners.  Some individuals who are not tech savvy can confuse the two sizes.  This had no affect on my purchase, but it may help others distinguish between the two different physical sizes of SDHC memory cards with their purchases.""
"20120501","1.0","Does not work on DSLR","I thought I hit the jackpot but this memory card does not work on DSLR cameras. It starts then stops.""
"20120427","4.0","Great card....no case","I bought the 16GB card to add to my camera bag so I'd have some extra memory when shooting videos on my point and shoot.  Great card, great price.  The one catch is it doesn't come with the small plastic case to store the card in when it's not in your camera.  This isn't something you want bouncing around your camera bag, especially once it has all your data on it.  Luckily I had an extra one from an older card.""
"20120427","5.0","Reliable","Product does as expected. Important thing about these are that they are reliable and so far no problems. Price per gig was very good. I would buy this product again.""

"20120423","1.0","Didnt Work","I did everything I could to get this thing to work. I thought maybe it was locked. When I tried to take pictures with  it in my camera, I got an error message saying the memory card could not be read. It wasnt even identifiable when I plugged it in my card reader. Bad product.""
"20120422","5.0","Good size for the price","This memory card is big enough to hold ripped movies to be played on my Toshiba Thrive tablet. It also has enough extra space to include a few favorite photos. It works well with both my PC and tablet.""

"20120422","4.0","So far, so good...","This two pack from Sandisk was nicely priced and the cards have performed their duties admirably. Longevity is always the biggest issue with memory, and I have not owned these very long. Will they last? Only time will tell.""
"20120421","5.0","works in my Canon Elph 300","Got it safe and not broken- but wish the package it came in was either in a safer package or better storage card.Otherwise, it works great in my camera and i enjoy being able to take more pictures than with my 4 GB. :)Will buy this again when I need/want more. Or maybe I'll try the 16GB...who knows?""
"20120421","3.0","Okay For normal Use","I am a photographer and this just didn't have a fast enough buffer speed for fast shots.  It works great for normal shooting conditions like a point and shoot camera.  Not for heavy use for serious photographers.""

At first, I was skeptical as I had a bad experience with a memory stick pro with micro SD card, eventhough I formatted the card and it takes pictures but, not video.  However, this SanDisk card works excellent both for pictures and Video.""

This one works fine.It is a class 4, so if you plan to record video, then it maybe too slow. If you are just taking photos, then this SDHC card will suit your purposes well.""
