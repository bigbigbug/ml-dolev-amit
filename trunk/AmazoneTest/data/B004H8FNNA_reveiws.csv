"20120513","3.0","Decent Camera","I received this camera as a gift after my Cannon A2000IS died. It is very small, which is nice unless you have large hands or arthritic hands. It takes nice photos in general, and the advanced features make switching between modes amazing, although it takes getting use to. I am not impressed with the indoor photos that need flash, however. I do not like the heavy yellow tone the flash seems to leave. The flash also leaves the subject overexposed. One will need to practice before understanding how to get the best flash photos. This is the exact complaint I had with my first Sony, and why I switched over to a Cannon. I have yet to locate and flash adjustment to tone it down. Overall, nice little camera for everday use.""

My first impression was that the build is pretty good. It is solid and really compact. However, that is the only good thing this camera has to offer. The image quality is really poor and noisy. The auto modes are so simple that they are really frustrating to use. It may be me who haven't mastered the use of the camera yet, but i hate the way it flashes every single time there is not enough light instead of using or allowing the user to use a slower shutter speed. On top of that, the flash is also really harsh and awful.I get many pictures which are overexposed by the camera even thought those pictures were taken in a moderated lit room. This camera is really the type that fits the old saying 'you get what you pay for' perfectly.  Generally, the build is good and compact. However, the picture quality is super awful. Digital noises are everywhere. I regret buying this for my mother as a birthday gift.  Note: this is just my personal experience and knowledge. I don't intentionally denounce sony or anything.

I sent it to Sony, and surprise--they didn't find anything wrong with it. They just reset the camera, which did absolutely nothing. As soon as I tried to take another photograph, it did the same exact thing. The new problem it has had is not recognizing my memory card!

It's super slow and hard to focus.  There were so many pictures that I missed because it took too long to take the picture (and, as you know, kids don't quite sit still).  I have shots of them getting up, turning their heads, with their eyes closed, but very few shots that I actually wanted!  And, many of them are blurry because the kids moved.  There were also times that I missed the opportunity altogether because I had to press the button multiple times or hold it down.  It's really a plug-and-play item in that once I charged the battery I could just toss it in my purse and go.

It's light, has an easy to use menu and excellent warm colors with high megapixel count.  Great for the money.  I did learn though that the QUALITY of your SD card determines how fast the digital camera processes per picture.  I started with my old SLR's 2MB basic SD card and upgraded to a $15 high capacity 4 MB SD card that processess 15MB p/second and it is noticably faster.  If I had went with the 20MB p/sec or 30MB p/sec card, I'm sure it'd be even zippier.  So happy with my purchase.""

This was the first time I had used Sony digital cameras and after just 4 days the LCD screen distorted with a 2cm strip down left side white since then, and for one week all colour from the screen disappeared.  Slow to focus, and doesnt seem to know what the focus is on.  Agree 100% with previous reviewers, many photos turn out blurred, this rarely happened with the Panasonic.  Also, the battery cavity door slides open, its positioned under the camera where your thumb rests when taking shots, as move your thumb it opens the cover.

But this one seems to have gone retrogressive evolution, basing on the general trend. Outside its megapixel has increased to 14 which actually does not matter, (5 is enough for regular view, including post card prints). But many good features are missing.Its 'i' intelligent mode has replaced most of the modes. Sometimes it just doesnt work. example- if you are using the timer, with flash off, it does not adjust the focus, and captures irritatingly blurred picture, even when camera is kept static on table. Extra strong flash gives overt lighting. Large screen is good but combined they dry up the battery really fast. With preference mode-selectors gone it only luck that you get good pictures when background and object are in naturally good lighting condition.""

"20111018","1.0","Do NOT buy this camera!","This was our 3rd Sony Cybershot camera (we really love the cameras).  It is super easy to use and takes great pictures.  However, we've had a lot of issues with the quality of the camera itself.  The first one just needed to be upgraded - so we got another Sony since we'd been so happy with it.  Second one I believe we got sand in at the beach - totally our fault.  The third one just randomly got a white screen last week.  First one half, then the other.  It's less than a year old and without a 10 month old receipt Sony is unwilling to do anything for us - other than offer us a minimum of $107 repair charge (which is more than the camera costs new).  The same exact thing happened to my mother-in-law so it's not a one off thing.  There is an issue and Sony's customer service was extremely disappointing.  Enough so that I decided to put my 2 cents worth out there.  :  Hope this helps someone else - we're shopping around for another brand and will likely never buy another Sony digital camera again.""
"20111013","1.0","Poor Quality Photos - Really!","Although I own a Nikon D90, I bought the Sony Cybershot because I wanted a small camera I could throw in my pocket and play with. This Sony Cybershot got excellent reviews and it was the right price.The camera looks great but feels cheap in your hands. The power and shutter buttons are clunky. To turn it on or take a photo, I have to press buttons hard with my fingernail. The 3-second recycling time per shot seems a bit long. Take a photo .... wait.  Take a photo ... wait.Forget the 14+ megapixels. That means nothing when the lens and the processor are cheap. Carl Zeiss lens? Who cares! A gazillion photo-taking features? Why bother! The Cybershot's photos lack detail and are quite poor in quality. As a matter of fact, they look like they've been doctored with the smart blur feature in Photoshop. Everything has that slick model clay look. What is the value of being able to make a 13' x 9' print that looks like total crap?I also own a 5-year-old Canon Powershot (5 megapixels) that takes better photos. I've made small art prints with it. In fact, my parents bought a 7 megapixel GE digital camera from Walgreens a few years ago for $85, and it takes better photos. Heck, I'd bet I can get crisper (though smaller) photos from my cheap iPod camera.This is a kid's camera, nothing more. If this were $40, I'd forgive a lot of its flaws. But at $100+, it's way overpriced. I returned mine.""

I didn't want to lug along my 7D since I was flying and was nervous about losing/breaking it so I went to the store looking for a low priced point and shoot. They were sold out of Canon so I went for this and it proved to be a great little camera! I love that I can fit it in my pocket, it turns on quick and shoots quick so you can catch good moments when you want them to, and the picture quality is pretty good.  I expected to be really disappointed by the photo quality since I use a higher end camera, but I was really happy with how all the pictures from my trip turned out and I'm sure I'll use it again in the future for similar trips/situations.I wish I had more image control,  the auto settings seemed to work fine but I do like to dabble with my own settings every once in awhile. That said, it's really not what this camera is designed for, so it isn't a real big negative.I didn't try video mode, but for quick little home videos and short videos on trips I'm confident it would be adequate.If you're looking for a simple, compact, easy to use camera that's going to give you solid picture quality, this is a a great option!""

Over all great camera make sure you have it on steady mode in case you tend to shake a bit while taking photos.

"20111002","2.0","upset","I read the reviews on this camera and it didn't look too bad.  It even has the Carl Zeiss lens.  It is a low priced camera so I guess you get what you pay for.  The battery door/sd card door  feels like it will fall off with a high wind gust.  The camera feels cheap.  Disposable cameras feel like they are built better.  The shutter lag really does lag.  For shooting indoors like at a restaurant with my family, it  was embarrassing.  The waiter attempted to take a shot and he held down the shutter for about 3 seconds, then a series of three flashes went off for around 3 seconds.  By the time it actually took the photo (after the 3rd flash) the waiter was moving his hand and the photo was blurry.  I'm not too sure on how long the battery life is cause I returned it for an upgrade.  For the price, it is a camera, and it does take photos, but my 3 megapixel camera from 2004 works better.  Oh, the panorama seemed to work fine from the one time I tested it, but the 'smile activated' shutter feature doesn't really work.""
"20111001","3.0","Why can't Sony use standards?","I got this for my daughter. I had very bad luck with Sony reliability a decade or so back; one Trinitron TV I bought died after 91 days - one day after the warranty ran out. Our Sony camcorder went in for repair every few months for years, until the extended warranty ran out. Even though we didn't pay to fix it, we missed a lot of memories while it was being repaired. After that, I swore no more Sony products.But my daughter really wanted this, and the reviews seemed OK, so I gave it a chance. It seemed OK until she lost the computer cable needed to download photographs. That's when I remembered the other reason I avoid Sony: The memory card is a weirdo format only made by Sony - it doesn't fit any of the standard card readers we have, either at home or at work. Same with the cable - Sony could have used an ordinary USB, but instead they put a non-standard Sony-only connector on the camera. Bottom line is that to get my daughters pictures I have to pay Sony a ridiculous price for a specialty item that is useless except for this camera. This time I swear: No more Sony for me.Too bad, because the camera is OK otherwise. It takes good pictures, is easy to use, and still works fine after 6 months.Update: I actually found a card reader at my local drugstore for $20 which read the Sony's goof-ball memory card. My daughter got her pictures, and I only wasted $20 and several hours of my time. I still wish Sony should use standard connectors and parts rather than trying to lock us in to their own non-standard designs, but except for that my daughter likes the camera; so I upped my rating to 3 stars. However for my next camera I'm going back to Canon - they make solid, standards-based cameras, even if they don't make a pink one; and every canon I ever bought still works - some (like my 35mm SLR film camera) over 20 years later. But if you never lose cables, don't want to swap or read memory cards, and really like Pink, then this Sony might be OK for you.""

"20110919","5.0","Owner Review - Nice Point & Shoot","I purchased this camera on sale to replace a point & shoot I had purchased in early '08.  My previous camera had HD video capture and a little more optical zoom, but it also cost about $70 more, even on sale.  This camera has two more megapixels, much better image stabilization, intelligent auto, and color accuracy.  I've been very happy with its overall performance; the only thing that hasn't impressed me is the battery life, but sometimes it can take a few charges for batteries to reach a true peak.  In response to the person who complained about the icons when trying to access your photos from the computer: the icons this camera uses on the screen are stored as files in the camera, and for some reason I guess most computers want to open that folder by default (I ran into this as well.)  There is probably a way to change the default folder your computer goes to when you hook up your cable, or if you have a memory card, you can remove it and place it directly in your computer to access your images.  The mild annoyance of my computer not knowing where to retrieve my images did not change the fact that this camera takes far superior pictures to my old camera at a fraction of the cost and in a much more portable package.  I'm very impressed.""

Reason I bought this one is because my last Sony was a touch screen and the screen eventually wore out after 4 years of good use.

"20110914","5.0","Great camera at a great price","I just love this camera. I bought a really great Sony Cybershot in 2009 but it was stolen in February 2011. I wanted to replace it for a trip to Ireland over the summer, but I did not want to a buy the same top of the line model. I went with this one and I am so glad I did.First of all, the price is really unbeatable. The number of megapixels you can get for just over $100 is incredible.I took this camera with me to Ireland for three months. It was fantastic because the battery life would last for an entire weekend filled with hiking and loads of picture taking. There is no bulky dock either, I like that I only needed a USB cord. This camera does require that battery charging be done on a wall unit. This is not ideal for a trip to Europe, but I experienced no problems when using a voltage converter, it never got too hot or lessened the battery life.If you are looking for something that won't break the bank but is really quality, I think this is a great option. I like the blue because I thought the black one looked dated. It is pretty bright, if you are conservative go with silver or black. It is really really blue.Update:About a year later, this product is still a great value. Of course, I don't think a new generation has been released, but it is gratifying that I can walk into a Target and not see a camera by the same make that is twice as good for the same price. Image quality is good for the price and with a little editing some of my photos from Ireland are print and frame quality. I also like that the item comes with a cord instead of a dock + cord like some of the other Cybershots. This is ideal for traveling, it packs up much lighter and you can import photos without a hard, flat surface (say from your bed in a hostel). The dock on my old Cybershot was unnecessary.""

"20110912","4.0","Takes good pictures","Actually, this camera takes fabulous pictures. If you can point and shoot without shaking excessively, this is the camera for you. The picture quality comes out amazing, and the auto-detecting features of the camera are very helpful as well. Things might show up a little grainy on the LCD screen in less-than-optimal lighting but once you get it onto the computer that's where you see just how great the picture quality of this camera is. I was taking pictures with my cousin the other day and he even compared it to SLR quality pictures!Some may think that 14.1 MP is a little excessive - it is. Correct me if I'm wrong, because I heard this from a friend, but theoretically the human eye can only see the difference up to 12 MP for regular sized photos. Higher MP also takes up more space on your memory card, so if you're the type of person who never deletes pictures make sure to get a bigger SDHC card. I personally prefer the best quality pictures, whether or not my eyes can detect the difference, so I went for the highest MP on the market.It is a lot smaller than I imagined it to be. It's totally pocket-sized and very easy to carry around.Unfortunately, aside from fantastic pictures, cool features, and the cute size, this camera is lacking everywhere else. When I first picked it up I was surprised at the cheap quality of the plastic that covered it. Of course, this makes it very light and also adds to the portability of this little camera. But I'm also very afraid of dropping this thing because I'd expect it to break into pieces in its first fall. If you know you are prone to dropping things, this might not be the camera for you. Of course, this problem can be fixed by using the wrist strap provided in the packaging, and/or spending an additional $5-$10 on a camera case. But I still have to reiterate that this camera's exterior is really not made very well. The door for the AV cord (the cord that connects the camera to the computer via USB) wiggles like a loose tooth and I wouldn't be surprised if it broke off altogether within the next year. I wouldn't recommend this camera for children under 13.I agree with the other reviewers that the shutter speed for this camera is indeed, horrifyingly slow. I don't think this is the type of cameras to take to sports games or other places where there is a lot of movement and fidgeting involved. This may be the first camera I can call my own, but I know for a fact that compared to other cameras, this one very nearly crosses the line for being unreasonably slow. For my own purposes though, as a female college student who's not very interested in sports and doesn't have kids running around, I can look past this slight negative aspect.I haven't had the chance to use this camera all that much for an event or anything. So far I've only used it to test the quality of pictures, so as of now I can't really say anything about the battery life. But I don't think its that bad, really. Battery life is always something that everything can improve on.Overall, for the price of only a little over $100, you have to admit: this camera takes wonderful pictures. And I think the outstanding quality of photos this camera produces makes up for all its flaws. I am very happy about this purchase, but honestly, if something were to happen to this camera and I needed to replace it, I would go for a different model.""
"20110911","3.0","Generally OK, but a few annoyances & disappointments","I bought this camera to replace an aging Cybershot DSC-W80 that I had owned for  6 years,  and had served me well.Generally, the DSC-W530 performs satisfactorily;  it is smaller & lighter,  and does have more features,  such as the intelligent selector.The primary disappointment was that it took about 2 seconds after taking a shot, for the picture to appear in the LCD screen. In the DSC-W80 it was not more than a second,  so I definitely felt the delay.  Perhaps those who have not experienced faster performance would not be quite as disappointed. I tried taking shots at various settings and programs,  and the lag occurred in every instance.The pictures came out fine,  but tend to be grainy when I try to zoom in onto details - and this happened with every resolution setting from VGA up to 14MP.  Fortunately,  I do not need that feature often,  so I did not consider it as a major problem;  others may tend to disagree.All told,  I do not think that the W530 is any great improvement over the old W80,  but as I continue to use it,  I guess I will learn to live with it - I am a casual amateur photographer, after all.""

I have read all the instructions and have no idea how to stop this from happening each time. None of my other cameras has ever done this when transfering to my computer.

"20110812","1.0","Sony = Lemons and Lies","I purchased this camera from Walmart on June 3rd 2011 for a trip I was planning to Arizona. (I live in North Carolina). The first pictures I took with the camera were really great and couldn't wait to take pictures of the wide open mountains ranges in southern Arizona. However, on the third day of my trip I noticed the LCD began to look warped. Since this was my first digital camera I'm not sure what was wrong. I continued to take pictures in Arizona just hoping there was a slight glitch with the LCD display and it would not affect the picture quality.When I got home a few weeks later I uploaded all the pictures to my computer and to my horror noticed that they all came out poorly. Many of the pictures looked as if extra light was burned into the pixels and many of the pixels would softly bleed into each other. Hey, it looks great if you're trying to create a dream-like ethereal effect but that is hardly what I was looking for. Since I was quite upset I returned to Walmart and told that I would need to contact Sony. I did so. The Sony representative told me that I would need to mail the camera to their support facility in Laredo, Texas. I did so and paid about $5.00 to have it shipped. During my first contact with Sony I was told that the camera would be fixed since it was still under warranty. However, the story didn't last too long. I was then told that the warranty would not cover the 'damage' to the camera and that I would need to pay $37.00 for the repair. Then I contacted Sony again and was told that the camera would not be fixed and that they were just going to send it back to me. When I inquired about the reason for this I was told that 'moisture' was in the camera. I mentioned that I noticed the LCD screen would often fog up all time -- after all I live in the South and gets quite humid during the summer months. The tech then told me that 'ambient moisture' from a humid environment was not covered by the warranty. So in other words, if I use this camera on a humid southern day it make distort the pixels and Sony will not fix it.When I received my camera back from Sony not only had they not fixed the camera -- no surprise -- but they didn't even return my memory card. So the few pictures that did turn out well are now lost because Sony lost -- stole, misplaced, etc -- my memory card. So basically I just paid $5.00 and all I got in return from Sony was a lost memory card.Outraged, I went by Walmart to explain the situation to them and they actually were very understanding and kind and made an ad hoc decision to honor a return, even though it was outside their fifteen day return policy. However, I will never purchase another Sony product. Sony sells cheap cameras that cannot even withstand the humid weather in the south, and if your camera 'breaks' while the warranty is in effect they will still refuse to honor the warranty! The warranty I purchased through Walmart was even worse. I contacted the company that Walmart outsources to for warranties and was also told that they would not honor the warranty and that if I wanted it fixed I should try to take it to Radio Shack! So I guess the morale of this story is that warranties are useless and Sony sells lemons. Take heed.""

The computer interfacing was a little frightning but as a non techno-geek I just followed directions and things fell into place. I like the picture enhancing tools which R easy to use as you review your down loaded pics. There's a ton of tech applications that one can use if you're into high tech viewing. The battery life could be better. This is the one draw back that that needs to be noted. However, for less than $130 this 14.1 megapixel camera, 4 gig card and nice carry case is a great buy!!""
"20110807","5.0","Great camera","I haven't bought a new camera for myself in years, so I did a lot of research before buying this one. Actually, I did too much research and wound up confused. I finally just broke down and ordered this one because it seemed like a good deal.I'm really glad I bought it. It takes great pictures and it's easy to use. I don't like to spend a lot of time figuring out technology, and the menu on this camera makes things really easy to figure out. I haven't even looked at the owner's manual since I got the camera. The panoramic feature is awesome: just set it on panoramic, hold the button down, and scan the scene from left to right.The only thing I wish this camera had was a lower MP setting. It takes pictures in four settings: VGA, 5 MP, 10 MP, and 14 MP. The 10 and 14 are very detailed and ideal for blowing up into large prints. Even the 5 MP looks good in a large size. The VGA setting is pretty poor quality, not even worthy of viewing on your computer or sending to someone via email. The solution to this is the 5 MP setting, which produces a great quality picture but is also a very large-sized file, so you can't send many pics at once. It would be great if this camera had a 2 or 3 MP setting. Not a huge deal, though.""

And I have missed so many sweet family shots because I only had one shot to take- not 70.  I have tried it on every one of the cutesy little settings, and they all blur terribly. You push the button, and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seconds FLASH, then it takes the picture.  Whatever cute thing the 1 year old was doing is missed. What ever happened to the 'action' selection?The video is just as horrible.  It goes in and out of focus constantly and make a loud clicking noise on your video as it tries to focus.  I like to just sit the camera up on the tripod and get video of me and girls playing- not anymore. The entire videos are blurry.  Tried tech support several time.  They had me restart the camera.  They think I'm moving my hand too much.  Funny...I've been able to work cameras up until this one...Christmas, Easter, first birthday, third birthday- all videos that are in and out of focus like a drunkard coming to.I went with a more expensive camera thinking I'd get higher quality.  Don't do it!""
"20110802","2.0","Great pictures but horribly slow","I've purchased Canon cameras exclusively for the past 15 years. This was my first foray into other brands, and while the photo quality (particularly in low light situations) is fantastic, this camera has made me regret my decision to do so. For a point-and-shoot it fundamentally fails the 'point and SHOOT' test because of the frustratingly slow focus time. The camera simply will not take a picture quickly. I can't tell you how many great shots I've lost because of this feature. I've read the manual, played with the options and experimented with different ways of taking shots ('focusing' early by depressing the shutter button, just hitting it once...everything!) and nothing seems to work. (I'm open to suggestions if others have noticed this)To be perfectly fair, the quality of the pictures is really great. I just wish there was a way to make it faster and, therefore, more usable. If you don't have kids and pets, it's a great camera. However, uncooperative fast-moving subjects make for very tough photo opps.""

"20110726","3.0","I want to like this camera.","This camera takes beautiful pictures when it's a sunny  day. That is, if you're willing to wait for the shutter delay. It hesitates and sometimes doesn't even capture the picture. If it's dark out or you're indoors, then forget it. You'll get a bunch of blurry pictures and squiggly lines. If you do manage to take a decent picture, you'll be disappointed when you load it onto your computer. Many of my pictures comes out very soft and washed out. The battery slide cover is also in a awkward position. I find that I'll sometimes open the battery cover when I take pictures. I would steer clear of this camera.Edit 9/24:So I have taken the time to click half way, let the camera focus, and then snap pictures. However, it still hesitates and occasionally decides it doesn't want to capture a picture. I went out last night and 50% of the pictures were blurred and fuzzy. It took awful group pictures. Imagine waiting and smiling and after 5 seconds (that's a long time when people are drinking) the camera doesn't even take a picture or after the wait, the camera decides to focus on dust floating by. It's not a good feeling when people think your NEW camera is broken. I feel like I wasted my money. Even my cheap Samsung TL105 could at least take pictures in a dark club. Don't get this camera unless you plan to take pictures in good lighting. Also, the video sucks on this camera.Edit 1/11/12:I bought the Canon ELPH 300 a few months ago and in comparison, when the Cyber-Shot does take a nice picture, it is sharp and beautiful. The Canon consistently takes nice, but soft pictures.""

There is a mode in which you can take back to back picture but you can't be picky with the second frame.....whatever and whereever the camera gets, you get.  The pics without the flash or when flash is off seem to come out better than when the flash is on (or when set to automatic).  I've only had this camera for a couple of weeks and have not yet played with the menu to get the best set up....perhaps somewhere in the menu is an adjustment for the shutter delay.  It literrally takes 2-3 seconds before you can take the next shot.""
"20110721","1.0","Disappointing","After owning and loving the 12.1 megapixel DSC-200 (earlier version of this model) I thought that surely the newer version would be even more fantastic. However, upon just holding it in my hands, I noticed that everything seemed more flimsy. True, it is a lighter, slightly more compact design, but the quality isn't as good as the old version. While watching video playback on my computer, I found that the resolution is really poor in comparison with that of the older one and the action shots are terrible, whereas I got tons of great ones with my old camera.Additionally, I have been using this camera for only a few months, and just two days ago I turned it on to find a white screen with what appears to be a horizontal crack running across its width; I guess it's a crack in the LCD screen. I am totally disgusted with the quality of the 530 - if the screen cracks while under very light, occasional use (my husband and I usually opt to use the camera on his Android over the Sony camera)then it is not practical for anyone.One good point: I did like the panorama feature while it lasted.""

"20110720","5.0","Very very good results!!!","I have always been a fan of Sony cameras and this one is no exception. It is cheap and can make 1080p quality video (although keep in mind that it is not a video camera and you do not get much recording time while making videos). Pictures are crisp and I love the colors. The charger that comes with it has no cord, which means that it is  a direct wall mount charger and I like it. I think with a million cables around home already, I do not need more cables :)""
"20110720","4.0","Great for it's size!","This little guy is a great point and shoot for traveling -- it slips into almost any pocket and starts up quick to get a shot fast. The battery life leaves something to be desired and I really can't wait for the day that every camera can charge by USB.Note: if you are traveling with this camera, make sure you by a converter that does not have raised edges -- one of mine does and the charger plug cannot fit in between the edges.Overall, I'm glad I bought this. It's the right price, works pretty well, and has a great panorama feature. Amazon also has great deals on cases and SD cards, so bundle if you need those!""
"20110719","5.0","I love it!","My family and I were going on a cruise in a limo for my grandparents' 50th anniversery. It was my first time in a limo let alone on a cruise and I was very excited! My sister had a digital camera and of course, I wanted one too. Not only for the vacation, but for other special memories too. So I was looking online and there it was! I knew it was the perfect one for me! It was PINK, it was a high yet affordable price, and it could hold many pictures without having to upload them. I came back and I had so much fun! My camera was loaded with pictures! I am never going to forget that cruise! This camera is very fast and extremely thin. I don't even know if it is in my hand half the time! I would recommend this to not only a friend but every friend and stranger I see. So get this camera and see for yourself how great it really is!""
"20110714","5.0","Simple and effective","I bought this camera for my daughter for an upcoming trip.  She was able to use it before leaving and I got to see it up close.  This is a perfect camera for someone who just wants good images without too much fiddling with settings.  Face recognition technology, quality sensor and lens and ease of handling = very good photos.""
"20110710","5.0","Excellent point and shoot camera","This camera is a good item for you to carry to parties, trips and to take some casual pictures. Of course, you cant compare it with a professional digital camera.But, I must say that the quality of the pictures that it takes, is great. Now, it doesnt has lots of features, but that ones that it has are excellent.The face detection is very accurate. It detects faces quickly and the other features related to this one, are triggered very well.The smile detection is excelent, you can set it and it actually takes shots only if people smile. You can take your own pic with this feature, its pretty comfortable to take self-portraits with this, the same thing goes for the timer activated with the face detection.Something that I like a lot is that you can take pictures while moving or with the subject moving, and the picture will not get blury. And it also selects automatically the best scene to take the picture.In dark scenes, this camera performes very very well. You can take pictures with low light, and still get a very nice quality of picture.Now, one thing that is really nice, is that its very easy to use. These automatic features let you grab the camera and take shots without worrying about anything else.The battery life, at least for me, is pretty good. You can take lots of pics and record videos without worrying about yur battery life. Of course, dont expect to charge it only once a week. But you can be sure that it will last for the whole night or day or trip if you give it the proper charge.And well its very small and the color is very beatiful. It actually fits inside my pants pockets.Well, this camera is a good item to have. If you want a camera for having fun like me, take pictures in parties, trips or funny moments this is a really good choice.I hope this review helps you.""
"20110704","4.0","Great camera for the price","The intelligent shooting mode is great--it detects different scene types (landscape, sunny, cloudy, etc.) and auto-adjusts the exposure settings to get the best picture. Picture quality is great. It also has a movie mode that takes nice videos. The mic for the audio is a little weak but it is only a point and shoot camera, so a so-so mic is to be expected. The panorama mode is very easy to use--just point and sweep while holding the shutter--and the camera automatically stitches everything together with no overlap or missed sections. I've used panorama mode at a baseball stadium and at a lake and got great detail in both settings.The battery life could be a bit better, but it lasts for at least 8 hours of shooting. I was turning the camera off and on a lot, which had a bigger drain on the battery, I'm sure.I first used a SanDisk 4GB Memory Stick Pro Duo with this camera, and the camera would not read the card properly. I even reformatted the memory card with my computer and the camera still would not read the card. I finally purchased a SanDisk SDHC memory card that works fine. Others have had problems too with the SanDisk Memory Stick Pro Duo, so be careful with that.Pros- Intelligent mode for automatically adjusting the settings; picture quality; movie mode and panorama mode; good quality for the price.Cons- Rechargeable battery could last a bit longer; Battery is specific Sony battery that can only be charged from a wall outlet with the included charging doc; Mic is a bit weak for audio when shooting movies.""

"20110630","1.0","Cheap Junk don't order","Comapred to my DSC-W50, this camera is cheap junk. It's going back.  It's light and flimsy and has no controls like the W50. I can't believe that Sony changed so much in 5 years.  I would prefer the older camera with less megapixels than this piece of junk.  It made me go out to the store and take a look at the new Sonys' -- they're all JUNK.""
"20110630","4.0","Great little camera","I just bought this camera and have used it several times. It takes really nice pictures and the landscape portion does an awesome job. I took a picture of the lake we were at and it looked great. The only con I have is the zoom it is only 4x so you don't get much for zoom, but all in all it is a great little camera that will fit in a pocket or purse and is nice for taking close up pictures. I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting something small to carry and take instant pictures.Where I live I am on a township board and needed to take pictures of all the roads that needed repair, took great pictures, and printed them off, great clarity and crispness in the photos, could see all the details.""
"20110629","5.0","Great Camera","Really just as expected. Quality hardware from Sony as always, quality images a camera at this size and price. Takes not only Sony MemoryStick but also standard SD cards as well. It's light, so it's not a burden to carry in a pocket or purse, but not so light that it feels hollow and chincy. The settings allow for very simple point-and-shoot operation as well as some more moderately advanced settings for different scenes and lighting. Intuitive interface. All-around good buy.""
"20110629","5.0","Good little camera.","This is a great little camera.  It does exactly what it says it's going to do.  First charge on the battery took over 125pictures without needing a charge.  I only charged it because I didn't want it to die in the middle of me using it next time.  Pictures look great in outdoor and indoor pictures. Best point and shoot I have owned.""
"20110617","5.0","Love this camera!!","I LOVE this camera! Only had it for a week, but this is the best part so far: I am not a photographer and not super tech-savvy, but I opened the box, put in the battery and extra storage thingy and turned the camera on and started taking pictures. I still have not looked at the directions and have been taking pictures and downloading them to my computer for a week.......the photos look really great to me. If you are looking for a camera for dummies that takes nice pics and is low priced, this is the one!!!!""
"20110613","4.0","Great","Love the small look,light, small and conveinent for travelling. One thing I love about it is the 14.1mp also the shutter speed that allows u to take photos with out the blur from movements.Great price for this upgrade.However, purhcase the memory card at time of purchase as well.""
"20110524","5.0","Great choice!","Was shopping for a reliable point & shoot digital camera & this was recommended to me by a friend. After researching & reading reviews, I decided on this one & am glad I did.""
"20110426","4.0","The perfect balance of beauty, affordability and usability","With the prices of DSLRs and mirrorless compacts edging closer toward the 400 dollar mark, the market for compact digital cameras is not as profitable as it once was. Manufacturers struggle to find every possible way to reduce production cost to bring the retail prices of these little imagers as low as possible while maintaining their usability as an actual digital camera.It would have been impossible to imagine a model like the DSC-W530, having a 14.1 sensor, usable high ISO sensitivities, 4x optical zoom with Carl-Zeiss optics to sell for anything less than 400 dollars just 5 years ago.With compact digital cameras becoming obsolete as soon as they are released, Sony has attempted once again to maintain its position as a serious point-and-shoot maker since their Mavica days.The W530, along with all of Sony's most recent W series, stands somewhere between Sony's entry level models and their somewhat advanced but expensive 'luxury' models. Under the current W series line-up, Sony has the W510, W520, W530, W550, W570, WX5 and WX7.For the past few years, Sony has been creating one ultimate point-and-shoot for each one of their W, HX and T series, stripping away certain premium features as they go down the price tags to finally arrive at some insanely cheap model made out of painted plastic for each one of those series.So for the price of just over 100 dollars, Sony was able to retain some of the more important features from their most expensive W model, the WX7 on the DSC-W530, and they are:1) Usable high ISO sensitivities at 1600 and 3200. Colors look a bit flat and the images look processed at these settings, but at least the images are usable for smaller prints (at a pinch, up to around A4(8R) sizes). Please bear in mind that this is after all a point-and-shoot and not a mirrorless or DSLR with APS-C sized sensors, so I'm applying a very different standard here when rating the high ISO output of this camera.2) Useful, good quality 4X Carl Zeiss optics and fast focus lock.3) Outdoor daylight scenes from ISO 80 to 800 are simply breathtaking, with sharp edges, deep depth-of-field (DOF), strong contrast and saturated colors, making this a great group picture camera (think family portraits at picnics etc). Although dynamic range (the total number of levels that can be captured from the darkest point to the brightest point of an image, without details getting clipped) is very limited. So beware of backlit scenes, and always point the camera in the same direction as the sun (the sun must be behind you) so your subjects are lit up as brightly as the background.4) Very elegant semi-metal chassis with brushed aluminum on the front.5) Extremely thin profile with the extra small battery, weightlessness: this camera will most likely be able to sneak into a concert without you having to convince the bouncers that you are carrying a bar of soap in your pocket.6) Generously sized 2.7' LCD screen with plenty of light under room lighting, just barely viewable under very bright sunlight.7) VGA video recording with sound and Sweep Panorama.8) Uses both Sony Memory Stick and the very afforadable SD cards (Up to SDXC), although this feature is nothing new but it's worth mentioning.However, the wafer-thin battery has very limited operation charge capacity, and the camera seems to be missing a few traditional controls such as creative mode selection (color, b&w, sepia, etc) and a 'mode' dial to give you direct access to preset photographic parameters. Some basic manual controls (like those found on the W300) over the camera's shutter speed and aperture were of course also missing, and due to the size of the camera, it is being operated and controlled by only a handful of buttons.And here's a list of things that I did not like about this camera:1) A Sony processor instead of a Bionz processor, although I personally do not think the Bionz processor is that great other than providing faster image processing. The Sony image processor for the W530 seems to be providing the same quality of reduction for high ISO shots as Sony's Bionz processor.2) No sports mode (may also explain the slower than average maximum shutter speed of just 1/1500 sec). Difficult to freeze moving objects when needed.3) No USB charging (Sony never had them though).4) Super slow continuous burst. At 1 frame per second, Sony might as well remove this feature altogether.5) No zooming during movie recording.But other than the few gripes above, I find myself enjoying the use of this camera completely. The camera is small, very light and looks really good up close and shoots half decent pictures under most conditions. The W530 also comes with a USB / Video connector (the video cable is supplied) so the user can playback their shots directly on a tv.At the end of the day, the W530 will most likely end up in your purse, napsack or briefcase for the simple fact that they are so freakishly small and easy to carry, provide butt-kicking images with punchy colors, balanced contrast at the resolution of 14.1 megapixel even at maximum ISO and the camera simply looks too elegant to be left in a desk drawer. The camera has its limits but as far as a point-and-shoot camera goes, Sony may have hit the right spot again in terms of beauty, affordabiliy and usability with the W530. Definitely worth a test drive if you are out there shopping for a compact point-and-shoot that looks elegant but cost a little over 100 dollars.""
"20110419","4.0","actual owner - great little snapshot camera","I was able to get this model a little early, and was excited to try it out in - what better city to test a camera? - Paris. The last Sony snapshot camera I used was on a trip in 2007, and I was so dissatisfied with that camera that I sold it immediately after returning home. I was eager to see if Sony had improved their entry level cameras, especially the picture quality. I shall post some pictures to offer examples up in the product details, but these will be reduced in size for posting.Photo quality: My initial day out indicated that they have made dramatic improvements in both quality and speed. Photos in daylight were crisp and clear in just about every shot, and any that weren't were only because I was shooting poorly on purpose to test the photos. I was also quite happy with the quality of shots in low light and indoors, which is where I noticed the most improvement over past Sony low-end offerings. There was some blurring in darker situations, of course, but for the most part the software was able to produce images that are well balanced and low grain. The 14 megapixel feature is great - there are many photos I've been able to crop and retain quality, and photos of, say, a stone sarcophagus can be zoomed in upon when viewing images later to see very good detail.I must also mention that the camera is very good at balancing photos. It almost always produces a picture with an appropriate contrast, and only in the worst cases did the image wash out in an area. For example, a shot of Joan of Arc (the statue, not the person) in Notre Dame came out very well even with a stained glass window in the background. The stained glass was bright but distinguishable, and the detail of the stone statue was clear and well balanced. Only in extreme cases - such as a shot of a black sculpture in the Louvre with a window behind it with blaring sunlight - did the camera fail to balance the image, but these are the kind of bad photography shots one would never expect a camera to take well.Types of Photos: Like most all snapshot photos, this camera will perform best shooting still subjects with plenty of light. Moving objects didn't tend to blur, a problem I'd had with other cheap snapshot cameras, but the response time can make getting these shots difficult. Trying to capture a motorcycle passing an old church, my 7-10 attempts were mostly good photos, but getting the moving bike in the exact spot I wanted was nearly impossible.Features: Overall, this camera lacks in features, although for most uses I found it sufficient, and at the price I didn't expect a lot of extras. The 4x zoom is relatively fast and easy to use, and about right for this type of camera. I was surprised there was no optical zoom given the high megapixels, but I can live with cropping on the computer. The panorama mode is nifty but not that useful - it works quite well in creating a long image, which of course will cause distortion in most cases. To use this feature, you set the mode and clich the shutter. The camera will prompt you to move it from left to right, and then it will generate the image (which is always impossible to see on the display owing to its shape.) Here I would have liked some add'l features - there is just 'one size' for panorama shots - you must sweep all the way across or the image will fail. This creates many shots that will need to be messed with on the computer later, which is okay but annoying. I was also disappointed panorama doesn't work in an up and down orientation - you always have to sweep the camera in the same manner. You can, of course, hold it sideways to create a vertical panorama, but I really wanted some vertical shots tqking advantage of a larger width. Still, panoramas of the Tour Eiffel allowed me to create some fun, unique shots of the full height of the structure. There are not many other features - just some rudimentary quality settings, face detection, etc. Some might want to move up to a camera with more features, but I actually appreciated this in a point and shoot camera.Battery life: Here the camera could use some help. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Apple products, but digital cameras have more or less remained stuck in 2002 concerning batteries. It's annoying to have a separate charger, and battery life isn't great. Three hours of shooting...granted, constant shooting...at St Denis drained it. Given how light and small it is, I'd fully support doubling the battery size to get twice the life. I'd also love for camera makers to start to move toward USB charging options.I'd also love it if cameras would start incorporating some onboard space. It feels like the dark ages to have to buy a card. 2 - 4 gig of onboard memory with a card slot for expansion would be nice.Overall, a great, small, fun camera that's easy to grab and go. I wish Sony would re-imagine some of the ways digital cameras work, perhaps taking some cues from iPods, especially regarding batteries, but for the price this nifty unit is great.Pros: Excellent pics for camera in this price range, good color balance, good in darker spaces, a few fun featuresCons: Battery life could be better, charging options, not many features or in-camera editing options""

Only in extreme cases - such as a shot of a black sculpture in the Louvre with a window behind it with blaring sunlight - did the camera fail to balance the image, but these are the kind of bad photography shots one would never expect a camera to take well.Types of Photos: Like most all snapshot photos, this camera will perform best shooting still subjects with plenty of light. Moving objects didn't tend to blur, a problem I'd had with other cheap snapshot cameras, but the response time can make getting these shots difficult. Trying to capture a motorcycle passing an old church, my 7-10 attempts were mostly good photos, but getting the moving bike in the exact spot I wanted was nearly impossible.Features: Overall, this camera lacks in features, although for most uses I found it sufficient, and at the price I didn't expect a lot of extras. The 4x zoom is relatively fast and easy to use, and about right for this type of camera. I was surprised there was no optical zoom given the high megapixels, but I can live with cropping on the computer. The panorama mode is nifty but not that useful - it works quite well in creating a long image, which of course will cause distortion in most cases. To use this feature, you set the mode and clich the shutter. The camera will prompt you to move it from left to right, and then it will generate the image (which is always impossible to see on the display owing to its shape.) Here I would have liked some add'l features - there is just 'one size' for panorama shots - you must sweep all the way across or the image will fail. This creates many shots that will need to be messed with on the computer later, which is okay but annoying. I was also disappointed panorama doesn't work in an up and down orientation - you always have to sweep the camera in the same manner. You can, of course, hold it sideways to create a vertical panorama, but I really wanted some vertical shots tqking advantage of a larger width. Still, panoramas of the Tour Eiffel allowed me to create some fun, unique shots of the full height of the structure. There are not many other features - just some rudimentary quality settings, face detection, etc. Some might want to move up to a camera with more features, but I actually appreciated this in a point and shoot camera.Battery life: Here the camera could use some help. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Apple products, but digital cameras have more or less remained stuck in 2002 concerning batteries. It's annoying to have a separate charger, and battery life isn't great. Three hours of shooting...granted, constant shooting...at St Denis drained it. Given how light and small it is, I'd fully support doubling the battery size to get twice the life. I'd also love for camera makers to start to move toward USB charging options.I'd also love it if cameras would start incorporating some onboard space. It feels like the dark ages to have to buy a card. 2 - 4 gig of onboard memory with a card slot for expansion would be nice.Overall, a great, small, fun camera that's easy to grab and go. I wish Sony would re-imagine some of the ways digital cameras work, perhaps taking some cues from iPods, especially regarding batteries, but for the price this nifty unit is great.Pros: Excellent pics for camera in this price range, good color balance, good in darker spaces, a few fun featuresCons: Battery life could be better, charging options, not many features or in-camera editing options""
"20110419","4.0","Review by actual owner - great little snapshot camera","I was able to get this model a little early, and was excited to try it out in - what better city to test a camera? - Paris. The last Sony snapshot camera I used was on a trip in 2007, and I was so dissatisfied with that camera that I sold it immediately after returning home. I was eager to see if Sony had improved their entry level cameras, especially the picture quality. I shall post some pictures to offer examples up in the product details, but these will be reduced in size for posting.Photo quality: My initial day out indicated that they have made dramatic improvements in both quality and speed. Photos in daylight were crisp and clear in just about every shot, and any that weren't were only because I was shooting poorly on purpose to test the photos. I was also quite happy with the quality of shots in low light and indoors, which is where I noticed the most improvement over past Sony low-end offerings. There was some blurring in darker situations, of course, but for the most part the software was able to produce images that are well balanced and low grain. The 14 megapixel feature is great - there are many photos I've been able to crop and retain quality, and photos of, say, a stone sarcophagus can be zoomed in upon when viewing images later to see very good detail.I must also mention that the camera is very good at balancing photos. It almost always produces a picture with an appropriate contrast, and only in the worst cases did the image wash out in an area. For example, a shot of Joan of Arc (the statue, not the person) in Notre Dame came out very well even with a stained glass window in the background. The stained glass was bright but distinguishable, and the detail of the stone statue was clear and well balanced. Only in extreme cases - such as a shot of a black sculpture in the Louvre with a window behind it with blaring sunlight - did the camera fail to balance the image, but these are the kind of bad photography shots one would never expect a camera to take well.Types of Photos: Like most all snapshot photos, this camera will perform best shooting still subjects with plenty of light.

Also takes very nice pics even when the kids are moving.""
"20120131","1.0","Unusable blurry images","This camera takes photos that are terribly blurry and noisy- I have better results from my 2 pixel camera phone. I have yet to take a photo where there is a clear sharp line. All edges are fuzzy and dull and everything has a weird blurred effect that looks like it came out of photoshop's paint effects. I took it back to the shop to compare with another camera in the exact same model to test if mine was broken and couldn't see a difference. The staff agreed that the photos are blurry. Unfortunately I received this as a Christmas gift and could not return it because I was over the return date. The shop where it was bought from has sent it to sony to see if they will send me another model. If they end up just sending it back to me I can guarantee it will not see the light of day because it will be living in my desk drawer.I have already started looking for other cameras.""

We did not damage the camera, it just quit working! Needless to say, we will not purchase another 'Sony' of any kind!!""

"20120129","5.0","Very good camera, very good price, very good delivery","I took advantage of an Amazon offer to buy Sony Camera W-530. It was delivered in record time and I am enjoying it. It is easy to handle, a menu that leads you to where you want to get with no complications. And its prints have a very good definition. My idea was to replace my Cannon A-95 camera with a smaller and handier one to handle. I've taken it all over with good results.""
"20120129","2.0","Not happy with this camera","This camera is so very frustrating.  It is lacking something the older models had and I just do not like it.  I had to exchange the first one due to large sensor dust that ruined many of our family pictures to the Grand Canyon.  I was a little relieved to see the dust spot because of the horrible focusing and other issues I had on this trip.  I figured if I exchanged the camera, the new one would work like my old Sony that was stolen from us.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  The camera just is not any good.  I shoot professionally with a Canon 5D and 24-70 2.8, but bring the small cameras everywhere I go with the kids so I do not have to deal with the big camera, or worry about it getting stolen or damaged.  I know how to manipulate settings on them to get what I need, but no matter what I do this camera just will not respond properly.  I will keep this one until it gets lost or quits working (which hopefully will be soon so I can replace it with something better).""
"20120127","5.0","Very pleased with this camera!","This is a great camera for the price.  I was looking for a camera for party or casual pictures and I have always used Sony for such purposes.  This camera is ready to use and offers plenty of features and functions for me to take great pictures.  The pictures taken with sufficient light, as always, are crisp and clear.  What I really noticed is how clear the pictures turn out even if they are shot indoors or with very very low light (this is a big difference compared to other Sony cameras a few years old).  One feature that I like a lot is that you can take pictures while either you or the subject is moving, and the picture will not get blury.  The camera automatically selects the best shot.  I am very pleased with this camera!""
"20120125","2.0","Disappointed in image quality","I had tested it in the store because I was looking for a camera without so much lag time like our old one.  I was excited to get it because it's ready to go within a couple seconds after turning it on, the auto-focus is quick, and it's very quick in between shots.  We ordered the camera just before a trip to Disneyland where we took a lot of pictures but once I had a chance to review the pictures we had taken it was very disappointing.  The images all looked distorted almost like pictures from an old camera phone.  It also picked up a lot of glare from lights and there were light streaks through some of the pictures.  I'm glad I purchased on Amazon though because their return process is very simple.""

Eventually, it began to flash from white to the actual picture giving me the opportunity to fix it. I went online to try to find instructions for the problem, which i found, only to have them not work.

The quality of the pictures is terrible, I took this camera to a corporate holiday event and all pictures came out blurry, also most of them had white patches. Also, this camera is very slow. It took about 10 seconds to take a single picture. I am definitely returning this camera and do not recommend it to anyone. I will continue using Canon/Nikon cameras in the future.""

She takes pictures at family functions, of her grandchild, etc. For the normal, everyday picture taker who just wants to take a picture, this is a good buy. If you're trying to be the next, best photographer, this may not be for you.""

"20111206","4.0","Light-weight super camera","Very light weight camera so, for those heavy handed individuals  -  this is not the camera for you.  I bought this camera because I needed a newer camera & wanted to take my family Christmas pictures.  Pictures were quick to focus in on 3 active young children and could quickly re-shoot if needed.  Clear crisp pictures for both short and long-range.  I noticed a lot of individuals had issues with battery life length (or lack there-of).  I actually haven't had to recharge it yet since Saturday (it is now Tuesday) and I have been turning it on & off, doing pictures here and there every day to include the 84 Christmas pictures I took on Saturday.  Still good to go.""
