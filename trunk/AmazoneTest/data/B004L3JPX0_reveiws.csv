"20120324","2.0","SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW","Avoid this slow bloated pixel camera. Having read the positive reviews one has to wonder if there isn't some astroturfing going on around here.I am an experienced photographer using digital and film SLR's and occasionally medium format film as well, when I can afford it, for almost 20 years now. I know how to use a camera, and I know the camera doesn't make the shot, the shooter does, blah blah blah.This is a slow camera. You push the shutter release, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait, and then the camera fires, and then guess what? You wait a little longer, this time for it to process the photo you've just made.There's a reason why this camera is cheap. It's got some great features. None of those features make up for the fact that this camera makes garbage photos. You can fiddle with the settings all you want. Jack up the ISO for low light, dump the outrageous marketing gimmick 14MP resolution (which is utterly pointless when the image sensor is literally the size of a pinky nail!), use fill flash, anti-shake feature, you still end up with dodgy pix. Sorry, but it's a fact. Look elsewhere, or be prepared to write an authentic lukewarm review.""
"20120311","5.0","best camera I've ever owned!","This camera is so amazing! I got it exactly one week ago and I am infatuated with this camera (weird? yes I know) I was scared that because it was inexpensive that it wouldn't work that well but this camera is just phenomenal. I've had about 6 little digital cameras before this one (I have bad luck with cameras and the whole 'breaking them' situation so fingers crossed nothing happens to this one) and this one is by FAR my favorite. My only and I repeat ONLY problem with this camera is the zoom button is quite tough to work but not impossible. The front screen really helps if you want to take pictures with friends and family. The focus is very nice and the camera takes beautiful photos! I do wish the video setting was a little easier to access but never mind that. The camera is so good to just keep around in your pocket and you can take it anywhere really. I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a GREAT quality camera that isn't too expensive. It wasn't hard to set everything up and I just love it!""
"20120223","5.0","Incredible little camera!","I purchased this wonderful little Samsung Digital Camera for my daughter who is heading out this week to study in Germany.  She has an Iphone that she used to take pictures on her last trip to Budapest, but her pictures just weren't that great.  She loved the convenience of her phone camera for its size, but again was disappointed in the pictures themselves.  Luckily, we came across this camera before she left. It is super small and easily fits into your pants pocket or small purse.  It has a cute little zoom lens that pops out while picture taking and with 14.2 MP it takes amazingly clear photos.  Also, the greatest thing about this camera is it is 2 sided.  Meaning you can point it directly at yourself and see the picture you are taking of yourself!  Really fun for the Facebook/Social media generation.  It is rechargeable..a must for anyone traveling abroad... and uses a micro SD card.  Just the most perfect camera.  I am purchasing one for myself today!""

This was a bummer... as I was quite disappointed since samsung usually puts out great products!

The camera was much lighter and seemed more fragile and the lens wasn't impressive at all. Every picture I took had a good amount of distortion, even for an economy digital camera. While the features are cool the distortion was a bit too much for me.I own a few higher end cameras so perhaps I'm just too picky. I returned mine the same day.The bottom line. If you're looking for a camera that takes flattering pictures. Keep searching or invest in something a little better.If you want something small and fun. Try it out.

"20111207","5.0","READ THIS before making a buying decision","I almost did not purchase this camera because of some negative reviews.  However, I have and I'd like to address the negative comments.BLURRY PICTURES - when taken in low light conditions:YES - this does occur.  It did when I used the camera for the first time.REASON - the user may not see the funky 'hand' that is displayed which indicates a questionable photo.The simple solution is to set the MODE to 'SMART AUTO' !  THIS SHOULD BE THE DEFAULT MODE for the camera.The first photos I took in low light were blurry.  I thought the camera was defective.  After I went into the user manual (which was NOT a hard copy  but a disk) I figured out what was going on.  Samsung should put in instructions on how to use the 'common' functions of a camera.DIFFICULT TO USE:MAYBE YES - For the 'average user' who has little experience in photography.  But only -IF- they do not set the camera in 'SMART AUTO', or try and figure out what all the MENU items are.If you just want to POINT AND SHOOT set the MODE to SMART AUTO.For the EXPERIENCED user this camera allows you to create photos any way you want.  It's quite amazing how many settings you can manipulate.SLOW RESPONSE between shots:PERHAPS - This has a -slower- response than some of my other cameras.  But this also depends on the lighting and resolution settings.  However, I bought this for carry around, not rapid picture taking.BATTERY not standard:NO it is not - Problem is, if you want a -very small- camera you must have a -very small- battery.  Resulting in an no standard (AA or AAA) battery.  Get a larger camera if you want such a battery.""

No place to put your fingers without pushing a button.  Proprietary  LI battery is a problem, what do you do if you need a charge in the field, too bad you cannot run into a store and get 2- AA or AAA battery and keep going.. You must have the stinking Proprietary cable to charge the battery and USB adaptor for 100-240 volt AC.. I had a SL30 which was great (2AA bats) until it jumped out of my pocket into the lake.. and I cannot find a good small point and shoot that still uses AA or AAA battery... AA & AAA come in rechargeable also but you can buy them in any country off the rack and keep going.. Not so with this one..

"20110512","4.0","WORKS fine, Has little annoyances as with all LOWER end cameras","After reading the few reviews that was posted here I was really confused with what others are experiencing. I know I'm a pretty good photographer but my above average knowledge of cameras should not be why I have not had any problems thus far.I primarily shoot with a dSLR set up with weights anywhere from 4 lbs to 7 lbs depending on the setup, taking 'self portraits' is next to impossible as a I'm a weakling of a man. I've been looking for a decent point and shoot camera for this purpose for a while. Although I have found a few okay ones in the past few years, Samsung 2nd screen is definite a great feature. When I saw that they put this feature in a $100 range camera I bought it.If you have never shot with a dSLR before and are one of those people who make fun of people carrying one. You need to try one out and take a look at the result. This camera is 14MP but the image is still not the best. Remember, it's the lense and the sensor size that produce a good quality photo, DON'T tell a person shooting with a 10MP dSLR that your camera is better because it shoots 14MP. Because I'm so used to dSLR quality, I hate P&S, if they weren't so dang portable I would never own one! The photos produced by this Samsung is on the soft side and low light is noisy. But in bright sunlight, most people will find it sufficient.I plugged it via USB on a MAC, Win XP and Win7. they all read, so I have no idea what other people are doing. The most annoying thing is that the shutter button has very little tactile feel to it. As you may know, you need to push the shutter half way to focus, then you push it all the way down to take a picture. This is too sensitive on this camera. I often push it all the way without noticing.Second annoyance is the shutter LAG in low light conditions. The LCD would go blank for a bit before taking a picture.Last annoyance (that I've really notice thus far) shot to shot recycle time. If light is good, it takes about 2 seconds, but in lower light it takes 3-4 seconds before you are able to take another picture. If you are using flash, be prepare to wait a bit longer...and I'm using a 4GB class 6 Micro SDHC (transflash) card if you needed to know.Sorry for any typos.""

I would need to carry around the manual and consult it every time I used this unit!  To say it is not user friendly is kind.  I had to take it back, and when I did, the headache stopped.""
"20110502","4.0","Lots of Features for the Price","Just recently purchased this camera for the wife.  All the time while on vacation trips, while I am trying to capture a shot on my camera, I would get this little tug on the shirt sleeve from the wife pointing out something that would make a great picture, which of course then I would miss the shot I was about to take. The solution, get the wife a camera that she would enjoy using, easy to quickly just point and shoot along with capturing some great pictures.  At first she wasn't sure about having a camera as she would just have me take the photo.  Now that she has used the camera for a short peroid of time, I most likely would loose an arm, a leg or both if I tried to take it away from her.  She very much enjoy using the camera, which by the way does take great pictures along with videos.  Its very small, which makes it easy to put into your shirt pocket or paint pocket, but not too small that would make it hard to hold.  I myself even found, after playing with the camera for a few minutes, thinking about going back and getting one for myself to use just as a carry around camera to keep in the car all the time.  I was amaze with all the features it has for the price, such as even program mode for the more pro camera buffs.  Even in low light, the auto smart setting did a very nice job of capturing a photo my wife made outside at night of our kids standing out in a parking lot of a resturant to where it even very clearly show the lights and signs in the background along with the subjets being photograph.  Something that normally would have caused an issue with the lighting. Accidently the wife even found out that the smile feature really works, while checking the camera out, it took her photo when she smilled while looking the at the front of the camera.  The display on the front is also a nice feature to have that you wouldn't expect to find in this price range.  An issue that may be a con to some is that the camera only uses microSD memory stick instead of the standard sizde SD.  To me, that wasn't an issue as most of the cell phones/camera combinations are now using the microSD and the prices have come down for the memory sticks.  I guess this was due the fact that the camera is much smaller than some so they had to make room some how.  We haven't done any fancy test shots to see how it compares to other cameras, but after using it, don't really see any reason to.  Its a fun little camera to have on trips or even around the home.  Its has too many features to list them all here as one can check out the specs or google the camera to find more about it.  The camera can capture at lower resolutions, if one need to save space on the memory stick. Also as you zoom the camera it will show you if its shooting at 14.2 or lower resolution to compesate for the digital zoom.  It comes with an AC USB adapter that charges the battery while in the camera. Yep, it uses rechargable battery instead of AA or AAA.  The same USB cord is also used to connect the camera to the computer for uploading photos or for downloading firmware and for special graphics for the children feature on the camera.  The CD that comes with the camera is only for the manual, a pdf file in many languages.  The software is stored in the camera, so once it is connected to the computer, it will ask you if its ok to install the software to transfer pictures.  The camera is also seen as a hard drive, so if you don't want to use their software, which seems fairly nice, one can just copy and paste the photos. I am running a desktop computer that uses windows 7 and didn't have any issues with getting the camera to be seen by the computer.  I also connected the camera to my netbook which has windows xp and also no issues there.  Not sure what happen with the other person that review the camera other than he may have gotten one that was bad from stock.  The camera does comes in several colors, but only have found the black one avail at the local stores.  With the 8gb microSD memory stick, it showed that around 1800 and something pictures could be taken in the highest quality mode.  There are now so many point and shoot cameras on the market and they all seem to do about the same in the quality of the pictures they take, that the only way to find the one you really like it too look at the features the camera has, what you are wanting to use the camera for, and how does it feel when holding the camera.  Most people now use the point and shoot cameras to send the photos via email or upload on the computer to look at more so than printing out the photos, which mean that all the megapixles in the world is not going to make the photo look any better if you are only saving the photo on the computer or uploading to facebook.  Even this 14.2 is an overkill for that, but if you are going to print out some photos from time to time, then the extra megapixles can help when doing very large photographs.  Just as and FYI, the cameras I use most of the time varies on what I am shooting.  I sometime shoot with a Sony DSLR, a Nikon DSLR and other times I use a Lumix DSLR, which I am finding to like more and more each time I use it. It nice to be able to switch between stills and videos using the same camera. As mention earlier, I purchased this camera as a gift for the wife and from what I can tell, it was a good choice.  It didn't resolve the issue about having the shirt sleeve being pulled while I am trying to make a picture, as now instead of her asking me to look over there at something I could make a picture of, its her saying....hey look at the great picture I just took, that you missed.  That's ok, as now there are two of us making photos when on our trips, so the action is never missed, I guess.""
