"20120409","2.0","Very slow","I brougt this for a PS camera, which is mostly used by my son as toy cam. This card is very very slow. Takes more than 3-4s between every snap to write.

"20120405","2.0","What you think you see is NOT what you get!!!","I guess we should all be more sceptical (or careful) about cheaper prices, even though we are looking for deals in todays economy. The picture you see is of an actual ScanDisk SDHC card, or should I say (San Disk) For $6.88 it works but it came in with a generic white label SanDisk. Well I guess this gets about as fake as it gets. I now have read there are thousands of these things around. The size is off just a tic once you get it to release you have to pull on the card to get it out of the camara. But so far....""

"20090130","1.0","Compatible??","The 8G card I bought would not work in my computers. The seller was nice enough to exchange it for another, as I thought it was defective. The replacement didn't work either. The four computers I tried it in were 2-6 yrs old. My IT friend told me these cards often are not compatible with 'older' computers. I am sure the card is not defective, just not compatible. The seller is willing to replace it with a 4G but I am not sure if 4G cards work either. It did work in my camera but I could only download photos (I think) if I plug the camera to the computer, that is, not using a card reader.""

"20090125","1.0","Card was total crap","Maybe I got a lemon, but this card performed terribly for me. We went to Belize and took hundreds of photos. Then when we got back, I tried to upload them to my computer; that's when the problems started. The photo thumbnails didn't show up, and I couldn't open the photo files. When I tried to put them onto my harddrive, the preview program froze. I restarted the machine, and my photos had disappeared off the card! We thought we'd lost them. It took my husband hours of work and $40 worth of programs to recover the photos. I'm really surprised as I had great experiences with Sandisk before. But this was terrible. Also, slightly unrelated but, looking at the Sandisk website, they recommend that you don't throw the disk away -- that you recycle it in some way, but they offer no help in figuring out how to do that. They really should offer to take care of it for you if you mail the card to them. We need some corporate responsibility for toxic waste!""

I had to straighten that out as well.Yes, I generally trust Amazon.  But what was my experience in buying this card from them?  That is what I am writing about.""
"20081105","5.0","extra card","In my opinion you have to have the extra card just like an extra battery. Also, it's important to note that I purchased this for the FS100 and I find that it takes quite some time to make the DVD's,....which is fine if you just take out your SD card and pop it in the card reader and walk away....and let it make the DVD.  So, you need to have another card in case you want to use the camera in the mean time.""

"20081021","5.0","Lot of space","In retrospect.  I probably would have saved a little money and gotten a 4 gig card.  I have taken well over a thousand 12 megapixel pictures on my camera and still haven't had to empty it out, and probably can take 700 or 800 more.  If you take a LOT of pictures, its worth it, but it really has to be a LOT to fill this bad boy up.""

"20080813","5.0","Works great on my Kindle!","I recently bought a Kindle and wanted the extra storage space for books.  The Kindle manual states that is uses SD cards, but didn't specify if it could use SDHC cards too.After chatting with a few people in the Kindle Discussion room, I found that others are succesfully using SDHC cards in their Kindle's, but Amazon Kindle Tech Support told me that they will not support SDHC cards at this time, should they fail.So being an avid reader, I took the chance and ordered the SanDisk 8GB SDHC card and it works like a champ in the Kindle.  I've loaded 7 books to it already and can read and write to it without a problem.  Be aware though, that only 7.3 GB of space is available on the card for storage when used in the Kindle.I have had no problems with any of the SanDisk SD, SD Micro, or XD cards I've purchased over the years.  They are reliable & durable and I will continue to purchase this brand again in the future.""

"20080326","5.0","Heed the Warning Well","It's a fine product, and it works just fine in products that support the SDHC format.  However, be ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN your product (be it a digital camera, memory card reader or--in my case--the Palm T|X PDA which for some STRANGE reason doesn't read it) reads it.  Just because your device is new doesn't necessarily mean that it will recognize SDHC cards (as opposed to the older SD cards).If your device recognizes SDHC cards, then by all means go forth and thrash.  You won't find a better card for the price.""
