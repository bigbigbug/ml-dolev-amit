"20120511","2.0","Very unimpressive for shots with movement","My family bought this camera for me as a gift prior to our family vacation based upon the rave reviews. I loved the display, ease of use, and compact size, but I am not impressed with its performance. The camera takes fairly decent photos if your subjects are in good lighting and are perfectly still, but if there is movement of any kind, the pictures often come out with ghost-like blurring. I tried using the action setting to see if that would help with the blurring, but it did not appear to make any difference. Many of our vacation pictures came out blurred, and I missed a lot of photo opportunities because I could not get the camera to focus in time to get the shot IF it focused at all.While waiting for our flight in an airport terminal, our sons were sitting on the floor a short distance across from us as they charged their laptop with a wall outlet that they had found. I tried to capture the moment, but no matter how many pictures I took, I could not get the camera to focus even though I tried different settings, flash vs no flash, and distances with the zoom. I don't know if it was because of the lighting in the terminal or the reflection of the shiny polished floor that they were sitting on that was causing the issue. I had the same problem at a family member's home one morning during breakfast. Most of the family was standing around talking, while other family members moved about. Once again, almost all the photos blurred. I'm pretty certain that the camera was having a hard time focusing because of the lighting in that instance. Another time our kids and their cousins were playing in a family member's front yard. The time of day was perfect; it was early evening with lots of natural indirect light. But every single photo blurred except the ones that I took of people that were standing perfectly still. Some of the photos came out with one person focused, while another right next to them looked ghost-like because they were in motion. For someone like me who likes to catch natural photos of people and life in action, I would not recommend this camera.""

The camera looks cool, is easy to care, and has a touch screen, but the picture quality is not near as good on this camera as it is on the S6000. Also, the touch screen has been a pain for us. Sommetimes is works just like it should, other times it's really sensitive, and most of the time it's hard to get to work.The camera is a simple point and click, but unless you must have a touch screen version I would highly suggest the Nikon S6000.

"20110721","4.0","Great Camera for the Pricerange..You wont be disappointed","I purchased this camera after reading through a slew of reviews at Steves Digicams, Digital Camera Review, and Cnet. I compared every camera I could find in the $150-$250 price range. I was set on not going over $250, no matter what. After being on the fence between the Sony Cybershot a Kodak touchscreen model, I decided to go with the Nikkon. Short version is this is a wonderful all around camera with very very crisp clear pictures and some nice features.Touchscreen- 8 out of 10. I will note sometimes you need to add a little more pressure than you might add on say a TomTom or other touchscreen device, but nothing too earth shatteringCamera Picture Quality - 9.5 out of 10. The pictures are crisp, reds don't seem to over saturated, and no noticeable blur towards the center or outside of a picture. I would say you are NOT going to get any better quality from a camera under $170..Picture Viewer/LCD - 9 out of 10. Clear, no huge delays between photos, sunlight friendly, and very good in terms of resolution..Video 780P - 4 out of 10. Here is where the camera looses hands down. If you are getting this camera for the added video function, LOOK ELSEWHERE! I did not need this as i have a kodak playful (i bought on amazon as always) which is small, and takes very good resolution videos. The video was grainy, and you can hear the Zoom when you use it, i personally don't care for watching a video and hearing a mechanical zoom in the background. I bought this strictly for its camera specs and quality, not the video functionOverall 8.5 out of 10.Great Camera, High Quality pictures, incredible resolution level 16MP for a camera under $200, and a nice small compact size.If your looking for cheap, easy to use, and only need it for its camera functions..I would buy it over a Sony, Olympus, Kodak, or Cannon any day of the weekAnd as always Amazon is top notch!""

This touch screen is lot much sloggy than iphone !!touch screen is most irritating thing to change image options.Also, whenever we have to choose scene modes it does not give any idea on scene mode selection mode ! that is time consuming thing.I would like to add some technical problem which I encountered for this camera is that after one month it started giving me technical trouble for charging because of that I sent camera 2 times to Nikon care center.

The editing features right on the camera are great and when I download my pictures, they are basically ready to print.  So, for the price I paid - I am very happy with my camera and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an inexpensive, easy to use pocket camera.""
"20110705","1.0","So bad I had to exchange for a Canon","After reading many reviews, I thought this would be the best option.  I needed to upgrade from my older Sony Cyber Shot and wanted a better zoom, better quality pictures, better camera for low light, and one that was easy to use.The Nikon S6100 was worse than my old Sony model, so much so that I had to return it.  The touch screen was extremely frustrating.  Very poor design and very slow.  Also, if you want a camera you can pick up and use quickly, do not purchase this camera.  I spent hours reading the manual (which has to be download to your computer)and still could not figure out some of the features.  I took a few pictures, had then developed and the quality was very poor.Thought I would write this review to save someone the frustration.  I return it and purchased a Canon SX230, which cost more but after using it a few days, it is definitely worth it.""
"20110629","2.0","Nikon vs. Canon - and the winner is...","I have a 5MP Canon Elph (which I've never had a problem with since purchase) that I bought six years ago came with an AC plug-into-the-wall charger for the battery that came with the camera.  This is great for charging extra batteries and doesn't require any additional ridiculous cord.  This Nikon comes with a plug and USB cord that plugs in to the camera to charge the battery.  Inconvenient. This is, however, a great way for Nikon to make extra money on accessories. In addition, as far as I can tell, the USB cord that comes with the Coolpix camera is a proprietary type, not a standard mini- or micro-USB, so you HAVE to have the Nikon cord to charge and sync your pics (if you don't have a card reader), so if you want a spare, be prepared to spend more money here too.  Right now, the battery is still charging, which according to specs, can take 4-6 hours.  So a spare battery that I can charge outside the camera sure would be handy to have...  I'll be sure to purchase off-brand so that Nikon isn't profiting from their tired old marketing scheme.  I'm old and I don't like change but I thought I'd try Nikon again, my first camera was an N2000 which I loved.UPDATE July 24, 2011:  I got this as a gift for a picky family member with arthritis so unboxed it and tried it out a bit. I don't like the touchscreen menus and HATE the touch scrolling to view photos!  In theory, to delete one photo takes four taps, but on a touchscreen that isn't sensitive enough, you may have to tap six or eight times.  I find the photos on the viewfinder look red, but once downloaded the color is fine, and it really does take very nice photos.  The video is OK, but if you're looking for great quality HD video, this is only 720p - I'd suggest finding a 1080p device.  I just don't enjoy using this camera.  Overall, I find I'm taking less photos because I reach for the camera less often, and that that's no good.UPDATE August 14, 2011:  I was taking photos at the birthday party today and after about 20 photos, I suddenly got a 'This card cannot be read' error on the screen!  Changed out the Transcend Class 10 SDHC 8GB card for the spare I carry, same error.  That ended my photo-taking for the day.  I got home, was thankfully able to load the photos I took onto my laptop, then formatted the cards.  Still no joy.  So I checked the user manual, which tells me that the four 'tested and approved' brands of SD cards are Sandisk, Toshiba, Lexar and Panasonic.  I happen to have a Sandisk SD card for my Canon EOS Rebel XSi (which I've never had a problem with in 3 years).  The card worked fine in the Nikon.  I checked the two Transcend cards in the Canon and they work just dandy.  Verdict:  Canon wins, I'm taking the Nikon back and getting a new Elph!  I wouldn't inflict this type of frustration on an enemy (but maybe an unruly family member...).UPDATE September 29, 2011: We exchanged the Nikon for a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH24.  The store did not have any Canon Powershot Elph cameras (that's WorstBuy for you!  Much happier, great photos too!  Someday, I'll get a new Canon...""
"20110629","3.0","not a good one","having a touch screen is an advantage, but if it works properly! For this camera you need so much pressure on the screen. Also, you need to charge the battery everyday (Maybe I'm using the camera too much).""

Some focus, some don't and they can't pull the problem ones before shipping them to the consumers.  Buy one if you like to gamble.  You may be lucky and get a good one.  I didn't so it was returned to Amazon and I bought a Canon ELPH 300 HS to replace it.  It was perfect right out of the box.""

"20110627","2.0","There must be better cameras","I've owned this camera for 3-months and waited until now to write a review because it was a gift and I really wanted to like this camera. But the more I've used it the less I like it. To be fair, it can take a descent picture under optimal conditions if you are careful, but so can a 1968 Kodak Brownie in the right hands. I really expected more from Nikon and modern electronic technology.Let me give you a little more background... I'm 63 years old and I've been taking pictures since I was 8 years old. Last winter I suffered a stroke which affected the coordination in my left hand and I found it difficuly to operate my Nikon D50 SLR. My wife, trying to be nice to me bought an S6100 for my birthday because she assumed that a point-and-shoot would be easier and less frustrating for me to use than my D50 SLR. I was excited to get it and try it out. The Nikon S6100 was smaller, lighter and easier to carry. As far as being easier to use,it is NOT! A person would expect an automatic point-and-shoot camera to be just that, point it, press the shutter release and get a fair picture most of the time. That's something this camera can't do with any regularity. A pox on Nikons house for the damn touch screen controls! Why have a touch screen shutter release function that duplicates the function of the shutter release button? While you try to hold the camera with your right hand you are almost forced to touch the screen while trying to frame the image and push the 'real button'. This more often than not activates the shutter resulting in a picture of the ground, your pant leg, or shoe. Then while you wait for the exceedingly slow electronics to store that image on the memory card, you miss several oportunities to try for a good shot. Would that this was the only problem with the touch screen. Nikon designed this cameras controls so the ONLY way to control various camera functions is through a menu system controlled using the touch screen. If that were not bad enough the screen itself is not sensitive enough to respond well to a finger touch unless you use a long finger nail or the little stylus hung on the wrist strap. This almost insures that you can't make any sort of quick option changes while you try to shoot. You may wonder if that screen does anything else. Yes, it shows a fairly bright image to use as a viewfinder or to review pictures of your shoes taken by mistake. Of course it is constantly smugged and dirty because you have to be touching it all the time.How about the overall function? The S6100 is as functional as most of it's competitors in the crowded point-and-shoot field. It's a snapshot camera at best loaded with difficult to control features and totally unecessary post shooting editing functions that are much better done on your computer after you download the pictures. I expected better from Nikon and I certainly thought that a 16 megapixel sensor would capture better quality shots. Again I was disappointed. My 6 megapixel D50 captures better images and it's over 5-years old. In anything other than optimal light, the automatic functions of the S6100 bump up the ISO a few clicks and once that's happened the image quickly gets grainy without gaining good exposure. Again I sure expected better from the newer class of sensors and software. The S6100 can also take Quicktime movies with a single press of the movie button on the back. This would be a nice function if the movie button were not small  placed directly below the right side thumb grip, almost ensuring that you will take some short movies you didn't want, again usually of the ground, your shoe, or the sky.Oh, and then there is battery life. Not too good. I can get maybe 200 shots and a short movie before the 'battery exhausted' message pops up on the screen, and then you are done since the only way to recharge it is to plug the whole camera into the charger or a computer USB port, you will be out of luck in the field unless you invest in a second battery, keep it charged and in your pocket while you'r out shooting.Do you think I've been be too negative about the S6100?Here are the good things about it:1. It's small, light, and fits easily in a shirt pocket or purse2. The zoom lens is Nikon, and they do make the best optics and the wide to full zoom is all you will probably ever need.3. When you manage to get a snap shot it's usually of adequate quality, at least for your family album.MY RECOMMEDATIONS:If you want a point-and shoot Nikon, check out the S8100 or S9100, both much better cameras at only a slightly higher price.If you want great pictures and care about control of your camera functions get a Digital SLR and learn how to use it.If you want a touch screen get a smart phone. Most of those will take pictures and movies too, and might be easier to use than this camera, plus when you get frustrated with the smugged up touch screen, at least you can use it to call someone who cares.""

Sometimes you have to do repeated touches or swipes to get the desired response.This is especially a problem when swiping through pictures as you view them. Sometimes it won't advance to the next picture even after several finger swipes - other times it will skip several pictures at once which is really really annoying because then you have to figure out where you were before - and do that without skipping too far in the other direction. I wish I had not bought this camera. I never owned a Nikon before, they have a good reputation so I thought I would try one. I may never get another.""

"20110609","4.0","Purty durn good camera for the price","We have a Sony DSC-W100 and after vacationing with some friends decided we need a new camera. The Sony had some REALLY bad shutter lag, therefore causing us to miss shots. After using a friends Kodak, i realized that my 7 year old camera was not cutting it. I spent weeks deciding what P&S camera to buy. The catch is I didn't want to spend over $200. I have a Nikon DSLR so naturally i looked at Nikons first. I did look at Fuji, Sony, cannon (i know i know) Kodak and Olympus. Not being in the camera market for years, i was amazed at how things have changed so much. I'm accustomed to my SLR and was not willing to give up much. My old Sony has quasi-manual settings, and great control over the camera for a P&S. After looking at the s4100, i noticed that there was too much shutter lag. I then looked at a cannon, and thought this is the one. For some reason I kept gravitation towards Nikon. Then, I found an absolute steal on the s6100 so decided to go for it. Right out of the box, the Nikon was ready to go (after a full charge of the battery). Downside is there is no physical manual. What am I supposed to read in the bathroom?? This is a very common occurrence with almost all electronics nowadays. Besides, it's good for the environment. Being a 'tech geek' who needs a manual anyways, isn't that was playing around is for?? My first impression of the camera was very positive. Lightweight, very fast start up time, and ready to go (in daylight). The touchscreen is very easy to use overall use is very intuitive, however might be too much for a first time digital camera user. Picture quality is amazing. DPI at full resolution (why would you do anything else?)is at 200. Compare that to my old sony which was 72 dpi. Higher quality and resolution. There are 3 shooting modes. One is automatic. This mode is pretty self explanatory. Now move to the scene mode shooting. Here's where this camera really shines for me. I took a low light picture in auto mode, then switched to scene mode and selected ' scene auto selector' The second picture in auto scene selector was MUCH better. I'm not sure which scene it chose but the background as well as foreground were lit properly. Something not achievable on my Sony... EVER. I'm used to being able to light a scene properly with my SLR and external strobe, so I was impressed. Something else that turned me on to the s6100 instead of the s8100 was the static flash. I know it's a minor complaint, but it's less moving pieces for me to worry about. Then theres' the tracking mode. Touch something on the screen (providing it stays still long enough for the camera to lock in) and it tracks the subject. Great for kids moving around! IT has many more features such as blink detect, face recognition and even a touch of the screen shutter mode. Movie mode has a continual focus mode and the ability to zoom in and out, all while recording in 720p HI DEF!! Granted the s8100 does record in full 1080P. I don't use the video mode enough to care to be honest. An to top it all off, it includes a full version of Nikon View NX2 which is a great importing and light editing program. It also includes a file transfer program as well. Absolute seamless integration with windows 7! The size is perfect. Small enough for a pocket, and to be taken anywhere and not be a burden. While still feeling substantial in your hand. 3 weeks later and I still love this camera and it's ability to take great pictures. The only thing i really gave up with the s8100 is 3x more zoom, and full 1080p recording. For the money I paid for the camera I couldn't be happier.Pros: Picture Quality. Ability to take great pictures on low light. 16mp at 200dpi at full resolution. Size. Fast start up. Very little shutter lag if any. Nikon view NX2. Seamless integration with windows 7.  Ease of use.Cons. 7x zoom instead of 10x. only 720p in video mode. No flash compensation for low light situations or zoom.""
"20110604","5.0","Excellent Pocket Camera vs. Price Balance","This 6100 model is an excellent and necessary upgrade from their $70-120 offerings.  The touchscreen, widescreen, too many features to list, and 720p video abilities make it a valuable tool.  The size and ease of use exceeds the competitions' cameras.  The improvement of the battery charger system (the standard wall charger eliminates the need to remove the battery to recharge) AND the PC USB connection now charges the battery as well.  After ~3 months of ownership, I haven't yet had to charge the camera off of the wall.  I do wish I bought the upgrade to this camera with the 12-14x optical zoom but even 7x is a huge improvement over the standard 2.3-3x on the $100 cameras.""

"20110428","5.0","great mid level point and shoot","I have had this camera for about 4 hours now, so I am obviously a professional here.  But I am amazed at this camera.  I'll try and keep it short.  The camera pictures are great indoors, great outdoors, great macro, good 7x opti zoom, Good white balance, great low light.  Functionally, it is a simple interface, fast start to shoot time about 2-3 seconds, no noticeable shutter lag, flash is good for very short range, poor after about 7-10 feet and tends to not illuminate the entire photo, unless subject is very close.Unless you are well schooled in SLR cameras, this will take as close to a perfect photo within a near range of subjects.  If you want to zoom in on a players nose hairs from the balcony of the stadium, this camera will not do it.  If you want to photograph your kids in normal light to dusk at 1-60 feet away.  I don't believe you could improve upon this camera.  I have not used it in bright outdoor light yet, so no opinion there.

Touch-Panel LCD is a nice feature.Only complaint I have with the camera is the image review after taking a picture lasts a seemingly long time. If you are trying to take multiple pictures quickly it can be annoying as the previous image takes up the screen so you can't preview your next picture.  Also, the touch-panel LCD isn't as responsive as you'd like it to be, but if you use the included stylus on the wrist strap it works just fine.  Just don't expect iPod Touch-quality responsiveness.Bottom line:Purchase this camera if you are looking for a point and shoot camera with good features, optical zoom, and a decent MegaPixel rating that come in a small package.""
"20110415","2.0","Nikon messed up on this design","I have purchased and owned a number of these little cameras, but owned this one for less than 30 minutes.  Nikon made a serious error in switching from the normal button cursor for the menus to a touch screen interface.  What were they thinking?  This guarantees that the screen in which you are trying to compose your photo will be covered with finger prints!  In all the cameras I own (nearly all Nikon) I try really hard to avoid touching either the view finder or the display screen.  If I am bothering to take a photo of something there is usually a detail that I need to be sure is accurately portrayed.  That just isn't possible with a screen that is full of smeared finger prints.  I have also discovered from my touch screen phone that wiping the screen has all sorts of unintended results.  (My briefcase frequently makes phone calls as well.)  Touch-screen technology is not the right thing for a camera.  I purchased a slightly older coolpix s6000 instead.  I had purchased 2 of them in the last six months for others I work with and knew that the quality was perfect for my uses and that the control mechanisms were more appropriate to a camera.""
"20110413","5.0","Great small camera loaded with features!!","This is a great little camera with alot of fun features. I had a hard time deciding between the s8100 and the s6100 because the s8100 takes faster pictures, 1080 video, a better sensor, and bigger zoom.The features listed below are the reasons I chose the s6100.Touch screen--can use your finger but it can be a little tricky to move it just right.  It does come with a stylus that allows you to move through the screens quickly. Makes it very easy to get through the menus.  The menu on the left has the options for flash, self-timer, macro, and exposure compensation.  The menu on the bottom has the options for touch shutter, image mode, movie options, and settings. The battery levels are always displayed in the left hand corner so there is no guessing how much battery is left.  Above that the scene mode is displayed.Scene selection--There are 19 scenes to choose from plus the scene auto selector.  When you push the scene button and all 20 options are listed there is a question mark box in the upper right hand corner that will explain the different modes to help you choose the right one.Filter Effects--It has the ability to draw or write on photos, add decorations, cross screen, fish eye, selective color, black and white, sepia.  I have messed around with a few of these features, I will try to upload a few pictures.  It also has glamour retouch and skin softening.Playback button--Has options to star a photo as favorite, delete, slide show, protect, print, draw, retouch, voice record, and settings.Charger--This camera can charge through your computer or it also has an adapter much like most cell phones now do so you can use the USB cord to charge using an outlet.  There is a light on the back that flashes to let you know it is charging.The dedicated movie button makes it very simple to record videos. Unlike the 8100, you cannot take a photo while you are recording with the 6100.From the opinion of a hobby photographer, I think there are alot of features nicely packaged into this pocket-sized camera.""

"20120320","2.0","Not so easy-to-use and produces blurry photos","I received this as a gift 4 months ago and like others, really want to like it but instead it just frustrates me. Most of my pictures are blurry and it upsets me that I cannot get decent photos at celebrations that are often at night and in artificial lighting. I am definitely not a fan of the touchscreen functions as I often end up taking pictures when I don't mean to. I want the shutter button to be the only method of picture taking and don't know why anyone would need the touch screen function for that. Moreover, what happens if the screen scratches? There is no back up way to go through your settings since there are no buttons on the side to do so (which I prefer over the touchscreen buttons anyway because they are very finicky). I will admit that I am definitely an amateur at photography, so maybe I am just not knowledgeable enough to know what settings to change in order to get better quality photos, but I was under the impression this was supposed to be an easy-to-use camera, and it is not. Prior to this I had a Sony Cybershot DSC-W290 and I LOVED it. The only reason I was given this Nikon camera was because my old camera was stolen. I think I am going to give away or sell this one and buy the camera that I know is actually easy to use and always produced good photos for me.""

"20120306","1.0","Shame on you Adorama Camera","I rated my product a 1 star toward the seller, Adorama Camera. The camera itself is a 4/5 (IMO).First, The Camera box was covered in a plastic bag with Adorama written all over it. When I received the camera, the box was extremely pretty banged up (it was even punctured). Sure, you could blame the carrier (UPS) for the damage, but I blame Adorama. They could have at least boxed it up to protect it. It IS an electronic after all. Would you want to buy a camera if you saw the box that holds the camera was bent, punctured, or smashed? No. Therefore, I am extremely disappointed on how horrible my product was packaged. Second, The box was opened. When i took the camera out, there was a big fat finger print smudged on the screen. I believe this product is labeled 'New'. It's not new when I get sent an open boxed item. To back up my belief that it's an opened box is because the wrist strap is missing.Now, about the Camera.The material feels pretty weak, I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks if I accidentally sit on it while it's in my back pocket. The touch screen is pretty responsive. It's pressure sensitive, so you do have to press on it, and not just touch it like how the ipod touches are. Think of a Nintendo DS or the old palm phones. That's why it comes with a stylus that attaches to the wrist strap (If only I received one).The Vibration reduction works pretty well, I tried to purposely blur the picture, and it comes out pretty clear. Though, the more you zoom in, the easier it is for the picture to blur, which is normal. Speaking of zoom, you do end up losing a lot of quality when you zoom all the way. The video camera does produce noise in low light situations like indoor house lighting, but it's not terrible. Has a pretty strong flash, it doesn't wash out the pictures at all.Over all, It's a solid camera for the price. If you're on a budget, this Camera is perfect, but you could get MUCH better ones that are about $20 more.""

"20120228","1.0","TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE W THIS COMPANY-NEVER SUPPORTING THEM AGAIN","I bought my COOL PIX camera after researching and reading great reviews for my business back in October 2011. It is now March 2012, and I've had it in my possession for a total of about 2-3 months. The rest of that time, it has been in repairs. I sent it back post Christmas after the lens jammed open. I was instructed to send the camera minus all accessories and battery. When I got it back from them, not only would it not work at all, it had a brand new scratch down the face, about 1/4-1/3 the size. I called the company,explained all this, and requested either a totally new unit, or a full refund; and was told by the supervisor to send it in and be advised of the 'next step.' Now, the reasonable person in me understands it could just be a faulty unit in an otherwise stellar line, however the costumer in me recognizes that this is seriously unacceptable, reflects badly on their product AND service, and that it is their role to correct this. I expressed to the supervisor that my fear was receiving back the same troublesome unit, AGAIN, THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAD DAMAGED and was told basically to play ball and see how it goes. I also wrote a letter voicing my extreme dissatisfaction and again a request for a new unit to turn this experience around so that I could be able to write a favorable review. I just now have been informed that the problem has been fixed to 'factory standards' and will be sent back to me. Not only has this camera been defective, it was damaged by their own repair staff. And in the 6 months that I've owned it, I have only been able to use it less than half the time. I let them know how they could repair my confidence, and was utterly dismissed. I can report that my best friend loaned me her camera, a CASIO brand, and not only has it worked perfectly, it has better settings, is more user friendly, and takes better shots. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING NIKON AGAIN. CASIO GETS ALL MY $$$$.""

"20120222","4.0","Good Camera !!","i bought this camera from best buy in january (2012) and so far it seems to be a great little camera. I bought this to have along side my Kodak camera that i have, and that camera is a bulky (its got big zoom) and sometimes i dont like to carry that in my purse 24/7 for that reason,i also didnt want to loose so much zoom like other small cameras.. So i needed something small and had some good zoom that i could stick in my purse and leave there for use when needed. this camera is perfect for that. i purchase a hard shell camera case for it so it wont get ruined in my purse. As for the camera, it seems to be really nice (i havnt had it long) its got 16 megapixels, 7x zoom (great for a little camera), touch screen, and some extra features. It also allows you to draw on your pictures with the in camera writing tool, which is pretty cool.the only cons that i have about this camera is that it does take a little long for the camera to come off of just taking a picture. the load time is a few seconds..i wish it could be a little faster, i did turn of the picture playback that all cameras have where you can see the picture for a second after you take it, i turned that off so it helped a little, but not to much. its is also a little slow when you push the 'playback' button to review your pictures, and i found nothing that can help with that, just have a little patience i guess. this reason is the only one i have for giving it a 4 star review, if thy had 4 and a half stars i would give it that because its not to to big a deal.All in all, it is a nice camera and the pictures look real good. im a camera junkie as i have had all different type of cameras, so a camera that takes nice photos is pretty important to me. i would recommend this camera to anyone who wants this to be an ad on camera, something that you can throw in your pocket or purse and just leave it there.""

I emailed Nikon customer support twice for assistance and they never even responded however right after I emailed them I started receiving Nikon advertising emails!It was suggested by a friend that I try a new camera battery even though the camera was a month old I thought I would give that a try.  After searching for a new Nikon replaement battery I found they were around $40.00!  I found an inexpensive one on Amazon.com for around $10.00 and that seemed to fix that problem.So the camera worked for a couple of weeks just fine THEN I turned it on & noticed the screen black on each side of the viewfinder.  The shutter won't open up all the way.  I could take my finger & slide the bottom open but the top shutter cover wont open. I finally got it open & now it won't shut!I gave up on emailing Nikon so I called their support number and they said I could send it in for repair & it was covered under warrenty.

"20120117","4.0","Good camera -- as long as you read the CD manual (4- stars)","Although it looks like a typical point-and-shoot camera, the Coolpix S6100 requires a little more finesse than some to operate at its best.  Sure, it can do automatic point-and-shoot photos, but unless you understand the two-step focusing process, the multiple focusing windows that appear, how to fix the disappearing screen, how the touchscreen works, etc., you may struggle.  The quick start manual that comes with the camera provides little help.  Once I figured out most of the features, however, I came to really like this camera.First, the good:  it takes excellent 16 MP photos, with a 7x optical zoom.  The lens quality is above many competitors'.  You can focus on a specific object or person, or take a quick photo, just by tapping the screen.  The large LCD screen is easy to see, even in fairly bright light, and the on-screen menu displays are readily visible when activated.  I like that I can take a picture with a touch of the screen rather than depressing the shutter button, although I have taken a few accidental pictures this way when handling the camera.  (This feature can be turned off.)  Switching between still pictures and video is easier than on most cameras since there is a specialized button right next to the screen.  Battery life is about average for a Li-On; my husband goes through two sets of AA batteries for his Sony in the number of shots I can take, with more on-time, on the S6100.  If you point the camera into the sun, a red circle appears in the viewfinder to alert you to a potential exposure problem.Next, the bad:  the time to write to the memory card is too slow, even when you select Continuous mode.  The touch screen, while generally responsive, sometimes lacks sensitivity, especially when using the lower tab.  The included stylus, which you can attach to the strap, works much better than a finger.  Autofocus doesn't work if you are using the zoom and have disabled the flash.Last, the neutral:  the included CD that contains PDF versions of the manual in several languages provides ample detail on how to use the camera and its advanced features.  The camera maintains the last settings used from power-on to power-on.  Although the factory settings direct the camera to sleep after 30 seconds of non-use (a real pain, especially if you're sight-seeing!), you can change the length of time to sleep (I use 30 minutes).  Make sure you buy an SDHC memory card since the camera does not come with even a low-capacity card.  It's a little on the bulky side compared to most of today's point-and-shoot compact digital cameras, an inch thick at its widest, but it's still much thinner than my old Canon Stylus.I like this camera despite some of its shortcomings.  On a recent trip, 95 percent of my photos were sharp, with good color reproduction.  The rest were either accidental shots, failed attempts to shoot a moving object, or, in a very few cases, unfocused shots.  That's as good as any digital camera I've owned.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann""

We tried this in several different settings and the auto function failed miserably every time.  If you have the time to scan through the scene settings every time you want to take the simplest of pictures this camera will be OK.  You will be much happier spending $100 dollars on a simple point and shoot than buy this camera.  It will take better pictures and you will at least pay for what you get.  Good Luck!""

So when my Casio Exilm broke (after working wonderfully for 4 years and then being dropped), I thought the Coolpix would be an upgrade.  The Coolpix worked wonderfully on our vacation, but the pictures were mostly outside in the daylight.  But I found that when taking pictures indoors, they either came out clear, but with a strong yellow color cast, or normal coloring but fuzzy focus.  I know in many of the situations, the problem could have been easily fixed with a flash, but the camera wouldn't allow it to be turned on.  This was true as I switched between scene and auto modes.  All of that aside, the placement of the buttons on the back side is very unfortunate.  It is way too easy to accidentally press the buttons (causing scene mode changes or switching to video mode when it is not needed).  I did this almost every time I tried to take a portrait oriented photo.  Long story short: I don't like the touch screen.  I don't like the lack of manual controls.Back to the Casio Exilm I go.""

"20111221","2.0","Expected more from Nikon","I am a photographer. I've used many DSLR cameras and still use one on a regular basis.I wanted a small, quick point-and-shoot camera to use for fun purposes, like parties, road trips, etc. Something that I could shove in my pocket and take a quick snapshot.Having used a Nikon DSLR for years, I came to expect a lot from the brand. But after playing with this camera, I'm pretty disappointed. The biggest problem I have with it is the touch screen. It is a pressure-sensitive screen, unlike a smartphone or an iPad. You can't gently slide your finger around or tap on icons. You really have to PUSH on the icons to make menus work, and you have to really press and drag to look at your photos. Not only that, if you aren't familiar with a certain icon in the menu, there is no way to read the title without actually pressing it and using that setting. So the only way to find out what these mean (short of memorizing the manual) is trial and error. The camera does come with a stylus that works fairly well, but if you're anything like me, you aren't going to want to have to make sure you have the stylus with you all the time and you wont want to take the time to find the stylus and use it every time you want to use the camera. The whole point (for me) was to have a quick camera. I don't need to waste time playing with a stylus.Another problem I have with this particular camera is the fact that despite 'image stabilization' you get blurry photos in adequate lighting situations. I turned the flash off because I was in a well-lit room, and the photo still came out blurry. If I were able to adjust the shutter speed, maybe this wouldn't be a big deal. But as far as I can tell, I can't. Even if I could, the menus are so frustrating that I gave up. There are very few words in the menus. They are made of not-so-standard symbols that are less than descriptive.Overall, I found that I loved the IDEA of this camera, and am ultimately disappointed with the actual product.""

It's behaving like it's set to ISO .00001, and I'm not sure it's worth another $20 to ship it back.No more Nikons, long live Panasonic Lumix.""

"20111217","4.0","Point and shoot enjoyment","Our brother had this camera when he came for a visit.  There were many things he liked about is so after looking at the other comparable cameras in this category we decided to buy it.  It is smaller than our Panasonic bridge camera which makes it more convenient for much of our daily picture taking yet we will keep the Panasonic as there are many things it will do this one will not.Picture quality is pretty good from what I can tell.  The photos inside without the flash were better than the ones using the flash in an office setting.  I used it during our office party and it captured good photos even when people are moving.  It will automatically focus in on faces and there has been no red eye challenges, etc.  We have not used the movie mode yet so I canont say how the quality is for that.You cannot ask for a much easier setup and the menuing system is easy to follow.  Use the stylus that comes with it, just hook it on the strap and it will be much easier than using your fingers.  Overall it has nice settings and options.  One real feature it is missing is the number of pictures left based on the card size.  You can get estimates from the web yet I expected it to be on the camera like most of the others.  It is a small thing yet the small things are important sometimes.Overall we will enjoy this camera for much of what we want to capture.  It has a really solid feel compared to some of the others I have looked at.  This is the first Nikon I have had and for the category I believe it was a good purchase at a good price.  It was on sale and I added it to the cart and then went to view some other cameras just to make sure it was the one I wanted.  While shopping the price dropped another $5 and that was a nice surprise.""

It probably does more than I'll ever need, but who's complaining? It has proven to be extremely durable as well! Pictures are so clear and this model has the new focus feature that makes life so much better when using this camera!Cons: None that I can see.""

"20111114","3.0","Okay for snapshots and some landscapes","I have a Nikon D90 and just thought I'd carry this Coolpix camera in my purse.  Love the touch screen and options (borders - writing on photos).  I have yet to get a good macro photo - they usually come out blurry - in all fairness I will watch the CD that came with the camera regarding macros and see it there is anything I am doing wrong here. The landscape shots are nice but definitely lose focus in the distance and are a bit noisy. If you have a program to refocus and reduce noise you can still produce a nice landscape.  Great for candid photos of people.  Battery seems to last longer then I expected.  For the price this is an acceptable camera.""
"20111109","5.0","Techno-easy, great pictures.","As a 67 y/o grandmother with a photography hobby of creating many items for charity fundraising, I find my new Nikon to: be compact and light-weight enough for my purse yet solid enough for a good grasp, have an excellent LCD view, an easy to operate touch-screen for the casual photographer yet plenty of features to satisfy the more advanced enthusiast. Minor drawbacks are the on/off button which requires a firm pressure to activate and the carry-case is too small to hold an extra battery. But, the simple plug-in to recharge the battery, the increased zoom and wide-angle lens are great new additions (for me) that make it worth the trade-off.""
"20111107","4.0","Know nothing about cameras","Starting from the moment of purchase, Amazon as always was very prompt and the specs were very insightful.  As for the camera itself, the casing feels kind of cheap.  Not as sturdy as my old Canon Digital Elph 300.  But after taking it on vacation and using it, the pictures were amazing.  The touch screen was very easy to use and I didn't even bother reading the directions. I would definitely recommend it.""
"20111105","5.0","Puts The Fun Back In Photography","OK, I just got mine so it hasn't had time to break down, but when I fired it up I was amazed at the performance! I have been a professional photographer for many years. I used the Nikon F5 for many years and then stepped up to a D700 with a battery pack. The reason I got this is because my rig (camera & all my lenses) is so heavy and cumbersome that I don't carry it around unless I'm going out on a shoot - and I end up missing many shots that I wish I had gotten. So I opted for an inexpensive point & shoot to throw in the car and take with me when I'm going to the store, running other errands or walking the dog.This little thing is just what the doctor ordered!When I fired this puppy up I was amazed! It was.... just plain fun! The focus metering blew me away and the flash was amazing. I was expecting harsh over-blown, too bright images, but what came out were very nicely lit, even exposures.Makes me wonder what the higher end point & shoot models can do. But since I have an excellent higher end Nikon, I felt that would be a waste of money. This camera does exact what I wanted it to do. It's easy to operate, the zoom is smooth, the flash works very well and the pictures look great. I highly recommend this Nikon model. The cost is so low that if it did break, or was lost or stolen, I could replace it without too much pain and suffering.""
"20111031","3.0","Love....but breaks","I really love this camera, I can shoot great pictures, but the problem is, it keeps breaking. I got. This camera before I went to camp and a month later it broke. It wouldn't charge. I couldn't turn it on so I thought it was dead. I charged it and it still wouldn't turn on. I went to radioshack and they said it was the camera. So, gladly I had the warranty paper, and could send it in. I got it back and it worked great! I was so happy. Now, about a month or a little longer later, it has happened again! It won't charge (green light isn't flashing) and last night it had more than half it's battery. I'm really sad because I think this is an amazingly good camera, I am very happy with a lot of the pictures I have taken, I wish it would work. So, this is a warning, I am not sure if it is just my specific camera or nikon's coolpix in general.  The camera is a touch screen and with that comes a lot of editing options, like drawing on your picture. You can rotate, make it black and white, color specify, glamorize, etc. It is so cool! Many people have told me the lighting is really good as well. I am pleased with this camera, just REALLY sad.""

"20111027","5.0","Great Camera!","I have had two Slr cameras, one 35mm and one digital. (both pentax) I wanted to be able to have some of my SLR qualities in a point and shoot and so far this has been great! I have had this since it came out. This has been my first point and shoot.All of the pre set scene selections are amazing! I was taken back by the quality of the fireworks mode!The touch screen is eh so-so. It isnt as good as an ipod touch or ipad. Although much better lg phones, and droids touch response. only real quirky thing is the firmness, you need to use the side of your nail or stylis instead of fingertip.I am very pleased that this did not have the 'lag' that the other point and shoots I had played with (of friends and family) had. (pentax, kodak, cannon.) It does great with action shots esp. keeping up with a 4yr old and dog. I was even able to capture faces of kids on a merry-go-round!!!""

"20111010","5.0","How Can anyone not like this camera?","I had been looking forf a basic under $200 camera. I tried out a few others including a Kodak. All were very dissapointing. The main problem is that most lower priced point and shoots take crappy pictures. This Nikon takes wonderful ones! I found the Auto and the smart modes so easy to use. I almost never get a bad picture. I love the battery life and the 3 inches screen. Close ups are beautiful and detailed! I do a lot ebay selling and this sure comes in handy.  The touch screen is a bit tricky, but not so bad. I think it is a matter of getting use to this feature. The zoom is adequate and the quality of the video is good.  I honestly do not see why anyone would have a problem with this camera. I guess if you are a pro you may not find it adequate. For the price it is a heck of a camera.""
"20111009","1.0","Horrible zoom, couldn't focus, freezes up, BAD camera","I'm not a professional photographer, just someone who wants a camera that works great out of the box without a lot of tweaking necessary...just a point and shoot camera.  This camera failed miserably.  I've never had a camera actually 'freeze' and refuse to turn on after turning it off.  It happened 5 times in one day with this camera. I actually had to pull the battery, remove it, and put it back in to get the camera to work again.  The camera took decent pictures if you didn't zoom in at all.  Any zoom, and I mean ANY zoom, would make the camera unable to focus.  I have never experienced this in a camera before, even in much cheaper models.  Once zoomed in this camera refused to focus, resulting in many, many, blurry pictures.  I was extremely disappointed in this camera. Who knows, maybe there's some deep down feature buried in menus that would have alleviated my problem, but in my opinion any camera should be able to perform basic features out of the box...like focus and take a picture. As a side note, I now have a Canon PowerShot comparable in price to this Nikon.  The Canon not only out performed this Nikon but exceeded my expectations for a camera in this price range.""

"20110927","5.0","Great performance in a small package.","I must differ with the few negative reviews for this camera.I have a Coolpix S550 that is several years old, has features that are not as flexible as the S6100, but takes fine photos.  The S6100 takes the S550 performance ahead a few levels.  There are settings which allow the photographer to apply many selectable options or, set the camera to AUTO and let the software do the work.  Work that it does very well.  I am a veteran of 30 years of film cameras (two Nikon bodies, seven lenses and ten plus filters) who finds that this small camera does everything all of my film equipment could do, plus a lot more.  Add to that what I can do with each photo once loaded into my MacBook Pro and the possibilities are endless.  I must conclude that the authors of the negative reviews are not experienced photographers.  Anyone with a background in full manual film cameras would have zero difficulty with the S6100.  Thanks Nikon!!!""

"20110919","5.0","Great pocket camera - far beyond it's size","For years I used a pro-grade Nikon film camera, so my standards are high.  For international travel and family events, the Nikon S series pocket cameras achieve results as good as the old pro camera.  (I haven't tried giant poster prints, but that isn't my goal).  My friends with heavy cameras can't believe I get travel pictures with the Nikon S series that compare with their 'bulky' digital cameras.  When our old S610 started acting funny, we bought the new S6100 as the primary replacement, and will carry the old 610 as our 'backup' second camera.  The anti-vibration features allow shots that would previously have required a tripod.  I have gotten low-light pictures that friends with expensive cameras could not capture. The lens sharpness is pure Nikon.  The Nikon S series are GREAT.""

This camera never focuses on what I want, even when I do touch focus, and when I finally take a picture it comes out blurry.  When I zoom no matter how close or far it will end up blurry.  I have tried all sorts of settings on this camera, but none work.  If I try to take any picture everything ends up orange.  All these problems and it takes too long to take the picture.

"20110802","4.0","Good, touch screen needs work","The camera takes good pictures, and the lens quality is great.  However, there are two complaints - the first being the touch screen is not that sensitive and can be annoying to use.  You have to press fairly hard to get the action to register.  Second, switching between camera modes is a bit of a pain.  I moved from an older camera that had a wheel which was easily rotated to select a shooting mode.  This camera requires a couple touch screen interactions to select a mode, which is inconvenient if you want to get a quick shot.  The answer is to always use the auto mode, however sometimes it takes a few extra seconds of recentering the view after focusing on a certain lit portion of the picture, to get an appropriate mode auto-selected.""
