Chums Waterproof Camera Float
Save your new digital camera from going to the bottom of the lake, river, or ocean. The soft, foam-filled neoprene wrist lanyard easily attaches to most lightweight, point & shoot, waterproof cameras and accessories. The bright yellow color makes it easy to spot in the water. Not intended for use with large professional underwater cameras, or regular/non-waterproof cameras.
