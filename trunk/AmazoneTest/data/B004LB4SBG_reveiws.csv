"20120612","5.0","Worth more  than the dollar spent.","I bought this camera as an emergency budget camera as I had less than 12 hours to attend an event. I did not want to spend a lot of money on a camera, since I did not have enough time for a full scale research on cameras. I narrowed my search to cameras less than $200.00. I settled for this camera based on several reviews by both professional photographers and amateur users. The camera is a very good camera. The initial pictures were not as crisp as my previous camera but the more I got to understand this camera, the better did the quality of the pictures improve. The three things I quickly learnt were:1.This is a slow camera, if you are very patient with it, your picture qualities will improve. 2. When you focus on an object and you press on the shutter release button gently half way down, be patient for the broken square to turn green before fully depressing the shutter release button. 3.If you understand when to use the different scene modes, then you have close to a professional grade camera in your hands. The camera is excellent for low light scenes. I have not yet used the flash to snap any picture and all the pictures I have taken at night have been superb! I like the panorama and pencil sketch modes. Did I forget to mention the zoom lens of x15 for this price. The color reproduction is impressive. This camera could have easily been sold for between $200 to $300 by GE. Hurry and buy one,before GE makes one minor modification on this model and sell it for $300.00 as their newest model. My wife who bought a more expensive brand that was on sale, plans to use the 14 days grace period to return her camera after comparing her camera pictures with the ones taken by this camera.I recommend the following for this camera:1.Transcend SD HC 16GB Class 10 memory card.2.Sony camera case.3.Sony BCG-34HRE NI-MH Battery charger.4.SANYO enelope AA rechargeable batteries or the Sony cycle energy rechargeable AA batteries that come with the Sony charger""

I have several point and shoot digital cameras and a fine SLR digital camera. When reading the manual (only on a CD) it talked about white balance etc. I could not find it on the camera. A discontinued feature or a camera problem? I took a few photos indoors with and without flash and they were not good. Very grainy.  Went outside to shoot. All the pictures came out snow white on the LCD screen, and this was a cloud covered day. I tried all the settings and modes, but to no avail. The pictures looked the same when I loaded them on to the computer. I would guess the camera is malfunctioning right out of the box on day one. It is going back and I will not seek another of this model.Pros: It looked like a great camera with a lot of features.It malfunctioned right out of the box so I can return it!Cons: Never worked correctly.""

"20120607","1.0","Must be defective design","I just purchased two of these at the same time. I also recently purchased, just prior to the GE purchase, two Canon PowerShot SX150 IS 14.1MP Digital Cameras. The Canon's take a picture that is 'in line' with the view on the preview screen, as one would expect. These GE's BOTH badly skew, like about one-third of the previewed picture is shifted out of the taken picture, or said differently, the picture from the view on the viewfinder versus the actual picture taken. It does not matter if the extended tele is used or not. This is COMPLETELY unacceptable - I mean how could I know what I am taking a shot of when the preview is way, way off the actual. The skew is by no means minor - it is big time off. No wonder the camera does not cost much. I did like the on-off switch, which gets the POS started up nicely.""

This camera has the look and heft of a much pricier camera, and it was easy for her to use right out of the box. Heaven forbid she has to read a manual or insert the cd. So far, she likes it! I also purchased the accessory kit, which makes her look very professional. I wish the GE insignia was not so prominent. It takes away from the high end look of the camera. My own personal preference would be for something smaller to toss in a bag, but this seems to fit the bill for her.She rarely prints out photos, they may never go beyond her hard drive, so I can't comment on the photo quality. SHe loves to manually adjust the lens and zoom in on closeups. The camera seems to make her happy. If photography becomes more than a passing fancy, she may opt for a high end camera, but this is just right for her needs today.""

"20111230","4.0","Great Camera if you know how to use it","I purchased this camera recently (from a different site) based on the reviews here at Amazon.  The reason I took a risk is because one of the reviews stated that it worked great as long as you choose the right settings.  I agree 100% that you cannot take this camera out of the box and expect it to take a good picture.  You must know when to use the flash and what setting to choose (indoor, outdoor, motion, etc).  You must also change the size of the pictures and buy a memory card if you want more than 4 pictures . If the thought of this is too much, then don't buy the camera.  However the picture quality is great once you get the hang of it. Because it's not the most user friendly camera available, I can only give it 4 stars.""

Getting wonderful pics of our shy red-bellied woodpecker from 25 feet.  I do not have steady hands but the image stabilization and auto focus gets almost every shot perfectly. As other reviewers have said, read the manual but even an older non-techie like me has been able to find the relevant settings without too much trouble.

I bought the camera after reading the rave reviews and believed it would be good for my African safari. I took 450 pictures and a few videos. I was excited to see them when I got home but was greatly disappointed. None of the pictures were sharp. They were almost sharp but I became increasingly annoyed at the quality. Shutter speed is very slow and I missed animal pictures if they moved. The flash sometimes doesn't work. You need to close and open it to get it to work at times. The zoom definitely needs a tripod. My old Canon point and shoot camera made sharper pictures by far. I gave the review a second star for the video is decent. Due to the quality, I would never use the camera again so I am returning it at a loss.""

"20111211","3.0","Great features but misses on the basics","I've had this X500 for several months and used all the features.  It has a lot to offer by way of customizations and such but the focusing system is hit or miss (a deal breaker).  If you touch the zoom after focusing to compose the pic a bit more the focus goes out.  Between two feet and ten feet the pics are nearly always fuzzy.  You are better off to stand WAY back and zoom in then focus, or use the macro zoomed all the way out for close shots.  Outdoors this is no problem: indoors is frustrating.  Nearly all indoor shots are between five and ten feet so it's a coin toss to get a sharp picture, since you can't back off to twenty feet.  A brightly lit room is better, because the 'F' stop is larger and the 'in focus' range is greater.The zoom is very powerful, and the battery saving features (switching to eyepiece from LCD screen) is top notch.The lens cap does pop off all the time with slightest jarring......I put it on a short leather strip attached to the bottom of the lens body.....it holds better and still jumps off if I turn the camera on with the lens cap on.  If you can remember to stand off you will have decent pics, but the frustration of finding out later that some are blurry cost this camera two stars.""
"20111209","2.0","Started malfunctioning after 3 months","I was initially very happy with this camera as an upgrade from my Canon point & shoot. Sad to say the auto-focus began to malfunction within about 2 months, and at about 3 months, it began to shut down unexpectedly and work only intermittently. It has stopped working altogether now.Pros:relatively compact and lightweightDecent lens27mm wide angleAwesome zoom (15x optical)16 MPPanorama feature works greatAuto-scene modes - sunset mode is awesome.Cons:Lens cap doesn't stay onColor is a bit washed out when not using a color-filtering auto-scene modeBatteries didn't seem to last long (uses 4 AA)Battery and SD card access is on bottom of camera...inaccessible when mounted on a tripod. Unable to make use of quick-release tripod mounts that cover the access door.Package mention of 'High Dynamic Range' is misleading. This camera does not auto-bracket multiple exposure levels for use in HDR photography. It is possible to do manually by adjusting the exposure, however, any motion of the subject (i.e. clouds, water, animals, trees) will be a noticeable difference in each shot and detract from the quality of the end result.Overall, a fairly good camera for the low price if it doesn't malfunction in any way. I hope the poor quality of this particular unit was an isolated incident, and you have a much better experience.""

"20111129","2.0","Not a pretty picture","I was quite excited to get this camera, since I do love to take pictures and have used several different brands of cameras and was anxious to try this one. It was a disappointment.First I put in a memory card I had purchased for it and it said it was not formatted and the card was defective. I returned the card and got a new one and it did the same thing. I put it in my other camera and it formatted the card, I put it back in this camera and it said the same thing. I took another memory card that I have been using, put it in and it finally accepted that one. Then on to taking pictures. I have used this for over 2 months, trying to give it a fair chance, but after comparing pictures taken at the same time, with the lenses cleaned the same, this one is definitely not as clear, especially on indoor shots. (The other camera is a Panasonic Lumix which retails for $20 more than this one and is a third the size and has a much better zoom).The funny thing is, that, with the lens on this - as it goes out, it has been very off-putting to several people, they comment on how weird it looks. One even compared it to an old sci-fi movie with the edging it has on the sides of the lens. I also have had trouble with the lens cap staying on...So I'm really sorry that this hasn't been a better product for me.""

"20111110","5.0","It does everything but walk on water!","But then, I'm far from being a professional photographer. But I am a professional painter. My first camera 'as a tool' was a 35mm point and shoot Minolta. I felt as if I were cheating, but it sure made it easier to paint a formal portrait, etc. The Minolta could also be done manually, but I never used it. That was thirty two years ago. Today pics of my paintings are used for giclees and other  prints, so I had been paying a pro to 'photo shoot' them. His work was excellent, but never on time. Frustrated, I bought the GE Power Pro X500 as a learning tool before moving up into the big money range. I set The Pro X500 up in my well lighted studio, read the directions and took the shots. The giclees printed from pics taken by the Pro X500 seem little different than those taken by the profession photographer's $1800. camera! Outside shots using the pro X500 15 x Optical Zoom are also spectacular. I can even lace the shots together into one very long photo! However, I've yet to try moving shots.

The slightest movements by your subject as you click the button and your shot is lost.  This is definitely not the camera you want to take of little Megan's soccer games.  However, if you're primarily shooting still objects or posed subjects, then it's a great camera.  The images that it produces are beautiful for a point and shoot.  It also works well in low light; even without the flash.  And it feels solid in your hands.Most of my photos are of scenery, so the GE Power Pro X500 will work okay for me.  However, I also like to take shots of people just being themselves.  I like to do so as unobtrusively as possible.  Clicking a camera three or four times to get one shot sort of defeats that.  Overall, I think it will suit my limited needs.  I'm not sure if I'd buy it again.  I definitely wouldn't recommend it.  Although I like the heft of it, I think most people who want a point and shoot probably wouldn't.

"20111027","3.0","GE enters a very crowded market","I'm not sure why GE wants to get into this very crowded, low-margin business of consumer digital cameras.  Maybe they have some stunning new option that instantly sets them apart from the rest of the players.  Or maybe they have a compelling price or product offering.But they have.  Sometimes business decisions are beyond me, because the GE camera seems to be a very run-of-the-mill camera.At first heft, this is a very attractive camera, with a fully functioning LCD/menu system that looks good and handles well.  But, nothing new here.  It's about the same as, or perhaps a touch less functional, than a Canon camera of roughly the same price.Ultimately, the picture quality tells the tale.  And here's the puzzle: the camera doesn't take that great of photographs.  They are OK, but the image quality to my eye isn't as good as your basic Nikon, Canon, Sony, Kodak, or Olympus.  It's a shade off, a little fuzzy, not a sharp as I'd expect.As I've said, business decisions are sometimes beyond me.  Why would British Petroleum, after the debacle in the Gulf, go back to drilling with the same technology that had the company on the front page of very newspaper, leading the airwaves with the same, tragic images of apparently disposable sea creatures, doomed to die terrible deaths.Maybe GE bought some bit Chinese camera maker, and thinks that slapping the fine GE brand name will sell lots of cameras (I must confess it did attract me).  Perhaps they got a lot of 1 million cameras at a terrific discount, and wanted to move a lot of cameras by putting their name on it.I certainly don't see this as a serious move by GE into the huge consumer digital camera business.  I can see them do a specialty camera, since GE sells $1 million MRI machines and CT scanners.  They have an excellent reputation.  But why dilute the brand name with a so-so camera?You can do better for the money, in my opinion.""

"20111021","4.0","Great Camera for a Great Price!","I have had this camera for about 2 weeks and I LOVE IT so far.  Its pretty simple to figure out (although I am still messing around with it a little, just for fun  The zoom is great and when I took pictures of my son swinging I didnt even get a blurred image!  I also like the fun features such as the one that you can change the picture to look like a drawing.  It was actually pretty cool.  Like I said I am still playing around with it, but so far I cannot find a negative.  I highly recommend you buy a camera bag for it though, as it is kind of bulky.  This has been my favorite camera so far and I cannot say enough good things about it!""

"20111020","3.0","Good beginner's Camera","I think this is a very good camera for a beginner photographer.  It is very simple and easy to use and does a good  job.  Some of the modes are not clear but my favorite all purpose mode is scene mode.  It has various situations for you to choose from, for example, you are taking a picture of a car going by then it has a mode for that in which it will focus on the car.  Also it has mode for plants that brings out the color and a mode that draws out your picture in pencil, and many more.  The camera is medium size which was a little strange for me because I have large hands so it was difficult to keep my fingers off the lens.  The video shooting is poor, not any better than a phone camera video. I would recommend this camera to anyone that is not looking for a great video camera but does enjoy taking pictures and needs decent quality.""
"20111019","4.0","Great Camera for the price","This camera is wonderful. I love the quality of the images. The buttons are so simple to use and are excellent for the advanced technology impaired. There's a view-finder in addition to a view-screen. There are neat features like smile capture and panoramic picture stitching. For the price this camera is well worth it. It seems very durable too. I hope it lasts a long time.""
"20111019","4.0","Amateur's Proceed with Caution!","Buyers, this is not a point and shot camera!! We knew that it was a DSLR; however we thought we would have to do minimal to take a picture. Instead, we found the icon settings to be cumbersome and not user friendly, but we are truly amateur photographers. Day pictures were easy to take; night pictures were the problem. We found it more difficult to take night pictures because we could never find the proper setting.  The camera seems to have all of the functions necessary to take quality pictures, but you would need a cheat sheet to remember all of them when you are transitioning from day to night. You cannot use one setting for all night pictures, it fluctuates depending on the scenery (an amateur would not know this); this was too technical for us (we just wanted to take a picture). You will need to review the tutorial more than once and create a cheat sheet to carry around to remember the entire setting criterion. The camera lens is very sensitive, windy days will distort the picture making it blurry if you do not know how to hold it very very still. Overall, the person buying or operating this camera need to be more than a novice to operate it efficiently and must remember it will not function as a point and shot!  Amateurs Proceed with Caution! It is best used by an middle to expert level photographer.""
"20111018","3.0","Good camera for the price, could use some improvements","This camera has a lot of advanced features for the price.  It's certainly a strong contender for people who want a camera that has many features but is still relatively easy to use for an amateur.  My experience so far has been that the picture quality is mixed, but generally good.  The anti-shake feature works well.  It also has impressive battery life.That said, there are some drawbacks.  The design of the camera is wide like a SLR.  This of course allows the camera to have some better features, but the average person (myself included) is probably going to prefer to carry around something smaller that can fit in a pocket or small bag.  The camera also doesn't have an optical view option, which would be helpful in some situations.  The small window you can use on most cameras to view your target directly is actually an LCD display.  The lens cover is also irritatingly loose.Ultimately, if you are looking for advanced features without the price, this camera is a fine choice.  If you are looking for a camera that you can carry around everywhere and rely on for consistently good quality, you may want to shop around.""
"20111017","4.0","GE Power Pro Digital Camera","I have to say that this is an impressive looking camera.  It's inexpensive, yet doesn't look like a cheapy.  I'm no photographer, but I have owned a few cameras.  I like some of the features of this camera and it does a good job of snapping a few portraits.  Where I have to downgrade this camera is with taking action shots and especially action shots from a distance.  I used it at my son's school play (I was in the back of the audience).  It zoomed in well, but most of the shots came out blurry.  It could be me, though.I'm going to research a little, experiment some more, and then come back and update my review.One thing that I do want to note is that if you buy this camera, be sure to buy a memory card.  I only got 3 photos with the built in memory.  Kind of a bummer.  I was really wanting to try it out.  So, I had to order a memory card and wait to take any more photos.""
"20111013","3.0","READ THIS","I'll make it pretty short because I know not many people enjoy reading an extremely long review. I got the WHITE one.

Pictures are inconsistent in quality, the screen on the camera is not so great so dont judge the pictures until you download them to your computer. Indoor pictures are great when put on the setting indoor and flash. Outdoor can get some GREAT shots.OVERALL FOR THE PRICE, GET IT.""
"20111012","4.0","This is a good basic camera.  My only two troubles were the flimsy lens cap and the problems with close up shots.","This a great general use camera.  The instructions for set up are easy and I loved the clarity of the pictures.  The camera use is also pretty intuitive -just fooling around you can figure out most features.  The secure gripping on the camera is perfect and it wasn't too big for my smaller (female) hand.  It also seems durable unlike my Lumix which totally broke down when if fell once.  Plus I absolutely love the stabilization feature which makes taking photos really straight forward.  The only big problem I had with this camera is that I take very close up shots of jewelry and I thought the 15x optical zoom on this camera would be better.  I had difficulty getting any shots up close so the details of the jewelry were apparent (and believe me I tried everything) and had to settle using my 8 year old Nikon (a 4x zoom) instead.  This camera also did not have has many scenes/options to choose from such as Lumix - pretty basic.  The other thing I found slightly annoying is that the lens cap is a little cheap and kept falling into the view of the lens when I was taking `down' shots.  This forced me to use two hands, one to take the shot and the other to hold the cap out of the way of the lens.  This felt awkward and if you are trying to take difficult shots with one hand the lens cap will annoy you.  Plus the lens cap doesn't have a very tight fit on the lens, so I worry it may come off and the lens may scratch.Overall, I am pleased with this camera.  This is a good basic camera.  My only two troubles were the flimsy lens cap and the problems with close up shots.  Also people who love to fool around with different options/scenes will be disappointed by the lack of extra features.""

"20110928","5.0","Bridge over troubled water","My biggest surprise with the camera is that it is made by GE. Evidently I've been out of the loop too long because I didn't even know GE MADE cameras.The GE power pro X500 is a 'bridge camera'. The phrase was coined in the 80s to designate a camera that bridges the gap between point-and-shoot cameras and the more advanced SLR cameras with multiple interchangeable lenses mostly used by professionals.I'm no expert. As a matter of fact ,in my youth ,I was famous for taking pictures with the lens cap on. This camera has a gentle press-fit lens cap which falls off when you turn the camera on and the lens  pops out. I also forget to open the flash and my indoor pictures still turn out great. LOVE the panorama feature. Just take the first picture, turn the camera until the circle and square line up and the camera does the rest! So far I haven't had a bad picture or video. I use the 8GB class 6 SDHC card.  If you want a camera that does it all for you this one does or you have a lot of manual setting if that's your preference.I use the google picasa software because it was already installed on my computer and I'm familiar with it. It works great for downloading and cataloging your pictures. I can't vouch for the GE software because I haven't used it.The manual is on the CD so I don't find it very convenient. Of course you always know where it is but it is a hassle scrolling through to find what you need to know. It is a PDF file so I guess you could print it out if you wanted.... 85 pages. I tried to print specific pages but couldn't get it to work.To sum it up I think the camera is great for the price... works great for the amateur and should satisfy the more advanced photographer. Oh yeah, also comes in refrigerator white.""
"20110927","5.0","Amazing Camera for the price!","I ordered this camera on Friday, 23 Sep. 2011 at 4:30PM and received it on Saturday, 24 Sep. 2011 at 9:40AM using Amazon prime and paying the 3.99 for overnight shipping.  That is amazing!Now to the camera review:This camera takes beautiful pictures!  I took it out of the box and without reading anything about it started using it and took 145 photographs in about 3 hours, I'm sure it would take them faster but I was hiking and had to have the right subject material to take a photo.  I never once felt it was to heavy or had any issues with it banging around while the strap was around my neck.  I do have a camera bag as well, so it was protected while not in use.I must have turned the camera on and off about 50 times, btw you don't need to do that after a minute of not being used it goes into a power saving mode.The Pros: Great pictures! Picks out the contrast between lights and darks wonderfully! Light Weight!Wonderful Zoom! Button placement easy to use!The Cons: Noisy, which doesn't bother me; Strap could use some padding;I have not used the video recording mode, but I have a HD Video recorder for that.I love this camera, I would recommend even to my enemies, if I had any.""
"20110927","4.0","Prefect for it's price","For the cost of this camera it couldn't be better. It has some issues with indoor shooting. You really have to choose the right distance and SCN when shooting inside to get it right but outside it's great. I love Nikon and Cannon but for $200-600 you can only find 12 and 14 Mega Pixels. This one is 16 which makes for great shots that you plan to blow up. I shot photos for a concert, party and charity event and they all came out great. Again inside you may get a few blurry shots but focus, adjust and always use the flash inside and you will get great photos. So I can't use this on all my shoots but for general photo journalism, head shots, general photo shoots,concert and party jobs it works great! GE may be on to something. I didn't even know they made camera's:(""
"20110926","4.0","I would wait and save your money.  Sorry.","We received our GE Power Pro X500-BK 16 MP with 15 x Optical Zoom last week and it took about 3 days from the order to receive. This is why we usually buy from Amazon unless we find an item much cheaper.  Some history: We are used to point and shoot cameras and finally got fed up with bad pictures and missing out on tons of our daughter's pivotal infant moments.  I would classify us as avid photographers and our use is mostly outside with the occasional inside shot.  We saw this camera and read the reviews and decided to make the purchase as most pros outweighed the simple cons.  Here is what we thought.Pros:  Durable Camera (plastic but feels solid), Easy to Use buttons, Tons of Manual Settings, Panoramic Option Is Very Easy, Love The Option To Use the LCD or View Finder, Battery Life  I USE 4 AA NIMH), Incredible Zoom, Flash Works OK!Cons: Slow Shutter Speed (there is a continues feature but we are not satisfied if it works that well), Wish It Had A Rechargeable Battery, No HD Movie Setting, the Macro Setting is Not that great so far,  I will mess with it more to check for sure) I was Hoping the Physical Size of the Camera was bigger so you could hold like a DSL. If you want to take inside pics, forget about it... Horribel.  Plan on staying absolutely still or you are going to have blury pics.  I wish I would have saved my money and just went to a true DSLWe think this camera will be JUST OK for us until we can afford a true DSL. If I had to do it over, I would have just kept my point and shoot and not wasted my money.  Yes I feel that way now!  We included some pictures that were outside because the inside ones were horrible! Sone with zoom and macro and on full 16MP setting.""
"20110922","4.0","Nice camera in its price range","First I will state I'm not a camera expert.  However, I do deal extensively with mechanical design and computers.This camera is loaded with features for the price and has an excellent feel mechanically. The display is large and easy to understand, although a thorough reading of the manual is mandatory for full comprehension of all its uses and features. The package includes the bare necessities: carrying strap, lens cover, software and batteries, but nothing more.So outside I go to snap some photos. The auto setting seems to work best for an amateur such as myself, and the quality of the pictures under many different lighting conditions are excellent.You can paste your own backgrounds in the photos, and a myriad of other touchup type operations are available on the camera itself. This is very nice because the included software's functionality can generously be described as 'limited'.  It seems to me that a tripod would be a nice accessory for this device as well.This is a fine piece of hardware.  It would be nice if the camera would have more on-board memory (it only has 14 meg, enough for 1 high resolution picture) thus making a SD memory card mandatory.A carrying case would have been nice as well as I wouldn't want to scratch up this beautiful piece ofwork on the first outingc.If you're looking for a excellent camera around this price range, the x500 would certainly fit the bill.""

"20110921","4.0","Lightweight, and easy to use","This is a great little camera. It is very easy to use. If you are looking for a camera that you can control more of the photo taking, yet don't want the full fledged expensive one that the pros use, this is a good choice. It is Auto focus, yet you can set it to a manual setting, aperture or shutter priority. Along with Program (where it makes all the choices for you) and even a movie setting for when you want to film those moments where only a video will work. As a parent, taking still photos is not enough, it is what is said and actions that need to be captured. The only con that I could see is when you look through the view finder, it is the same thing as the back lcd, and not actually looking through the lens; as a photographer, I am use to looking through the view finder and actually looking through the lens.""

Telephoto works well.Problems: being internationally correct, the instruction booklet is printed in many different languages, yet it is very basic in that it doesn't go into good detail on the features. I have had problems with the macro mode working but can't figure out how to correct it.  As other reviewers mentioned, the lens cap does not fit well.  Also, the placement of the camera strap is a problem in that it obstructs the lens very easily. If I were redesigning this camera, I would place the strap attachments towards the bottom or back of the camera and develop an internal lens cap that automatically slid over the lens when the camera was turned off. The cap is very useless as it is. Overall, the camera is very nice for the price.""

If you're feeling creative (or bored) there's lots of flexibility.Make sure you use a recognized brand of SD card or you may lose pics as mentioned in other reviews.The thumbnails were a surprise the first time I put the SD card in my computer, but I find them handy as email attachments; they're small and SD card storage is inexpensive. I like the 4 AA batteries; yes they add a bit of weight, but they're easy to get when I'm traveling/touring.

I have not explored all the different modes yet, but it is a very easy camera to use and it feels nice in the hand and my pictures have come out clear and colorful. The battery power does seem to hold well, which was one thing that was important to me. I did get the NiMH batterys and charger and over all I am very happy with this camera.

"20110729","5.0","BEST CAMERA EVER!!!!!!!!","THIS CAMERA IS AMAZING. I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA CAUSE MY OLD CAMERA WAS MY MOMS CAMERA THEN SHE GOT ANOTHER CAMERA AND ANOTHER SO IT WAS PRETTY OLD. I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA CAUSE WE WERE GOING ON A CRUISE THROUGH SCANDINAVIA AND I WANTED A GREAT CAMERA. THIS THING IS AWSOME THE PICTURE QUALITY IS GREAT, IT HAS A GOOD SCREEN, IT HAS AMAZING FEATURES. BUT THE THING I LOVE THE MOST IS THE SKETCH MODE YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE EXEPT EVERYTHING IN YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN WHILE YOUR ABOUT TO TAKE THE PICTURE IS A SCETCH OR WHAT THE CAMERA'S SEEING. SO THE END RESULT IT LOOKS LIKE AN AMZING ARTIST JUST DREW A PICTURE OF SOMETHING EXEPT ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS TAKE A PICTURE. IT GIVES THE FEEL OF AN SLR CAMERA WITH THE EASE OF AN POINT AND SHOOT.

"20110729","5.0","High value camera","The built-in cameras in cell phones and ipads are getting better and better so I thought getting a point and shoot camera may be redundant.  An entry level SLR camera will cost $400 or more so I took a chance on this 'bridge' camera which is a step up from a point and shoot but a step down from an SLR camera.The more I use this bridge camera, the more I like it.  I always preferred Canon cameras but this GE camera is even better. The photos and movies are sharp in bright light.  In low light, the Canon still has a edge but only in the automatic mode.  Here are my top ten favorite features:1.  15X optical plus 4X digital for 60X total zoom.  There is an indicator which let you know that you have gone past the 15X optical zoom and into the digital zoom since digital zoom will compromise quality.  I only use the 60X zoom for my movies and my movies are impressive when you can zoom 60X.2. The menus are extremely intuitive and very easy to use.  For example:  There is an SLR-like top dial to switch from automatic to the following settings:  program AE, shutter priority, aperture priority, manual, portrait, panoramic, movie, 20 scene mode, automatic scene mode.  Turning the top dial is superior to scrolling thru a menu maze on the camera screen.  One turn and you are done!3. The flash pops up and away from the lens which minimizes red eye.  The flash also has a red eye reduction mode.  If you forget to use the red eye reduction mode flash, the camera can even remove the red eye after the photo is taken.4. There is a dedicated button to switch from the LCD screen to the viewfinder.  A viewfinder is a must-have for taking photos in bright sunlight which can render the LCD screen useless.  The viewfinder displays all of the menus as the LCD screen so you are in full control.5. There are dedicated buttons for anti-shake (stabilization) mode and smile and face detection mode.  The anti blink mode is also great which prevent a photo from being taken when someone blinks.  The smile mode to release the shutter automatically is nice.  The timer is also very user friendly.6.  I took an indoor macro photo of a full page magazine article and a newpaper and the photo clarity was so good that I can easily read the text on my PC.  You should take 1 full second to hold the camera steady while 'slowly' depressing the camera shutter.  This allows the camera sufficient time to focus and setup correctly.7.  I love the panoramic option which allows you to stitch three photos into one panoramic photo.  The camera automatic release the shutter when the scene is aligned with the previous photo and the results are perfect.  I can't wait to take panoramic photos of whereever I go now since it is so easy to do and the resulting panoramic photos are seamless.8. Other features include:  (1) 7 settings for white balance;  (2) Exposure compensation settings from +2.0 to -2.0;  (3) Four color modes of auto, vivid, black&white, sepia; (4) Two auto focus modes of single and multi; (5) Three auto exposure modes of spot, center, AiAE;  (6) Automatic scene mode or you can manually set the scene mode with 20 scenes, such as fireworks, sports, sunset, beach, snow, etc, etc.9.  Since changing the settings are so easy to do quickly...this camera allows me to use the advance settings whenever I can.  It is so easy that I can't help thinking whether Steve Jobs may have designed how a user will access the advance settings on this camera.  My former canon had some advance features but it was so difficult to set up the camera that I ended up not using them.10. Uses 4 AA batteries which I prefer.  My last point and shoot camera was a Canon which uses only 2 AA batteries but my Canon drain down the two AA batteries very quickly.  This camera has an auto shutdown feature which you can set the time to shutdown.The negatives are:1. Bigger and heavier that a point and shoot camera.  However, it is slightly lighter than a SLR camera...especially with the zoom lens which is quite heavy on a SLR camera.2. No camera case.  There is a lens cap to protect the lens but there is no protection for the LCD screen.3. The strap looks cheap.  It works but I will probably replace it.4. Some sections of the manual are poorly written.  I figured it out the instructions after playing with it for a day with no thanks to the manual.5. Automatic mode in low light does not measure up to my Canon.  However, I can set the camera to the indoor scene mode or using the AE program setting and then adjusting the exposure compensate feature.  These extra steps will result in a low light photo that is better than my Cannon.  The negative is that you do have to set it up properly.6.  There is no flash adjustment (to lessen or strengthen the flash output) and no hotshoe for a flash add-on.  This is expected for a camera in this price range but I really wish I had this feature.My photos are much improved because I spend the few extra seconds to switch to the right mode to compensate for the scene, lighting and focus.  If I don't have the time, the camera has the automatic mode which works well in bright light.  I still can't believe that I only paid $130 for a 16.0 megapixel camera from GE with this many features.I highly recommend it since the quality and features blows away any point and shoot camera in this price range.  If you do not have the 3 to 6 seconds to set it up properly, which you will need for a typical SLR camera, then you need a simple point and shoot camera which means you are compromising some quality for convenience.  The extra 3 to 6 seconds will make a big difference in the quality of the photo and this bridge camera allows you to do this very easily.Dec 2011 Update:  I found out that this camera will take underexposed photos in certain low light conditions but I have since learned to make the adjustment for this weakness.  For example: I discovered that 'Program AE' mode works well for an indoor low light after you adjust the exposure compensation and making sure the white balance is correct.  I then take 2 shots with the flash and without the flash and then compare the two photos.  The main point is that this is a great camera for a beginner to learn how the advance settings work.  Potential buyers must take the time to experiment and learn the strengths and weaknesses.  You should not expect this camera to compenstate for beginners and a point and shoot camera is designed to do just that. Now that I have increased my photographic knowledge with this bridge camera, my next camera will be an expensive SLR camera after enjoying this bridge camera for a few years.  At this price point I don't see how anyone can complain except when the user take the disappointing photos in certain low light conditions and user did not progress to learn how to compenstate.  I suspect some of the negative reviews involved people who did not experiment with the different settings and then took photos in the wrong settings and prematurely concluded this is a bad camera.""
"20110728","5.0","Review along with Tips for your new GE x500","REVIEW: My last two digital cameras have been point & shoot Kodak's and it took so long for the camera to reset in between pictures I was missing shot after shot.  Plus, the Kodak's didn't have any kind of picture stabilization so half the pictures came out blurry. With that said, I was in the market for a different brand of camera.I was considering the Nikon L120 but really didn't want to shell out that kind of money so I kept putting the purchase off.  Then I came across this GE x500 with its list of equally good features, great reviews and incredible price.  I didn't even know GE made cameras so I have to say I was a bit leery about how good it would be compared to SLR style cameras with name recognition but I went for it and it has ended up being the perfect camera for my picture taking needs (vacations, special occasions, holidays, parties, pets, occasional on line classified ad or auction).TIPS: I haven't had the camera that long and with all the features, figuring it out can be a little intimidating but I've played around with it enough to discover the setting I found best and I wanted to pass it on.  When you turn the camera on for the first time it will lead you through the language and date set. (Super easy to do.) Once that's set up if you turn the wheel on the top of the camera to SCN, 20 little icons will show up along the bottom of the LCD screen. As you scroll through the icons it gives you a description of what each one is for.  Some of the icon modes include: Sport (for fast moving objects), Beach (for strong sunlight), Fireworks (bright images against night sky), Glass (for shooting images behind glass), Sunset, Snow, Indoor, Portraits, Landscape, plus several more including a few special affect modes. When you choose the icon/mode for your situation the camera automatically sets itself to take the best picture in that circumstance. Last night I took pictures in the house with the flash on and using the Indoor mode and I couldn't believe how crystal clear they came out. I was also able to take one picture right after the other (unlike my Kodak)! I'm very pleased and can't wait to discover what else can be done with this camera.WHAT YOU'LL NEED: You should also know you will need an SDHC Card since the camera only has internal room for 3 images. I bought the Transcend 8GB, Class 10 for $13.00 here on Amazon and it works perfectly even without formatting. The Class 6 would probably work as well if you want to save a few bucks although they are currently the same price...go figure. (The Class determines the speed in between shots, the higher the class the faster.) I also recommend the SMALL Zeikos Camera Bag available on Amazon for $5.00. (The Medium would be too big.) It's padded and the perfect size for this camera plus a few essentials like extra batteries, cleaning cloth, cables, etc.  I actually put my Flip Video Camera in the bag too.) Next, I recommend the Duracell Value Charger if you don't already have one. It comes with 4 pre charged Nimh batteries for around $13 on Amazon. You'll have all the accessories you need after these purchases. On a side note, I went ahead and paid the $10 extra to get this camera in white and it was worth it.  Love the look over basic black.CONS:  I was super disappointed that it came with a CD instead of a paper Users Manual but I printed out the pages I thought I'd refer to most (but that doesn't help if I need instructions on another feature and I don't have a computer and the CD on me @ Disney World). Lens Cap is cheap and doesn't stay on that well so I leave it off except while the the camera's in the bag (it has since been lost...probably in some hotel room some where). It didn't come with the Photo Editing Software (ArcSoft) as indicated in the cd manual (one of my review comments said it does come with the download on the CD...haven't checked yet).  I think it should have come with a screen/lens cleaning cloth (no biggie, just sayin).SUMMARY: Well, that's it. If you're in the market for an SLR style camera I really don't think you can go wrong with this one if you're an amateur photographer who wants to take better than average pictures (and as long as keep in mind that although it does have some point and shoot features it is an SLR which means you'll have some figuring out to do to take full advantage of those professional photography shots.UPDATE: Even though the Duracell battery's charge is *impressively long* while in the camera, you might want to consider purchasing an extra set of (4) Nimh batteries so you always have a set of freshly charged batteries in the charger.  That way you can just switch them out without having to wait 6 hours to recharge each time. Lastly, I found another handy feature using the camera wheel on top of the camera.  If you set it on ASCN the picture taking conditions are detected and the most suitable settings will automatically be selected without any manual adjustments. This feature is similar to the other one I mentioned (SCN) but with this one the camera automatically selects for you.  I've taken some great close ups using ASCN. (They actually came out better than when I manually set the camera on close up mode.)""
"20110728","4.0","My Third Camera","This is an good camera if you are not too serious about picture quality. It has a amazing 15x zoom. I found this feature more useful while taking pictures of birds without disturbing them. Picture quality is good in sunlight but poor indoors and at low light. Flash is average. I rate this 4 stars having optical zoom in mind. if I had picture quality in my mind, I would give 3 stars. Also battery charge stands more time.""
"20110723","4.0","Great Camera for the Price","I wanted a camera with high power optical zoom, but not needing too many bells and whistles, because they usually add a lot to the price and convenience of picture taking for a pure amateur.  I am pleasantly surprized at getting a 15X zoom for the price of the GE Power Pro X500.  The flexibility of scene functions will take some familiarization in order to select the best settings.  The many features add functionality of much more expensive cameras.  So far I would really love it if the lens cap would stay on!""

Bad reviews are garbage, and the people probably don't know how to work the camera. I was a rookie at taking pics but now feel like a pro.""
"20120531","3.0","A good value with fairly limited potential","I was looking for a cheap zoom camera and I saw that this sweet little zoom from GE had gotten good reviews with people saying that it took great pictures. After initially buying and using this camera, I've done more research about digital photography.  What I've discovered is that almost any camera can take 'great' pictures ---that is, if you're not taking pictures of a moving object, and you set it up right and use tripod or hold it perfectly still.I had naively thought that technology had advanced more, but it turns out that the laws of physics and economics don't change much. You see, lens quality is the real bottleneck on picture quality for most cameras and quality lenses are a scarce resource that continue to be hand-made from high quality glass that is extremely expensive. Lens prices aren't helped much from Moore's law.Zoom lenses necessarily require more light because the aperture of the camera shrinks as you zoom out. Thus to get the same exposure at higher zooms you need to use a longer shutter time or a higher ISO, both of which make it harder to take good pictures. The more useful and impressive features like fast-autofocus, good ISO performance, and quick operation generally require the larger bodies of DSLR's. Even high-end compacts are relatively slow. There are always tradeoffs in camera design so it's often difficult or impossible to have your cake and eat it too.This is a slow camera, so you can't just whip it out and catch the action. The zoom is much less useful that I thought it would be because it is so difficult to hold still and even with image-stabilization and a tripod there usually isn't enough light so you have to use a long shutter time but means you can't get moving objects which defeats the whole purpose for me. Also don't expect the photo at 100% resolution to look good at all. It's blurry and littered with huge jpeg artifacts. If you back out on the resolution it can look quite good but then what's the point of having all these megapixels?That being said this is still a pretty good value. The zoom is long. The camera as a whole is good for landscape and still life and occasionally you can get a decent picture of a moving object if you do it in bright, bright sunlight and take into account how slow this thing is. There are a bunch of scene modes for beginners as well as aperture priority, shutter priority, a manual mode so this a decent camera to learn on.But don't expect too much, like I did.""

"20110722","5.0","Wonderful camera at a great price!!","I was in the same predicament as some others who have reviewed this camera prior to my entry--I spend a lot of time outdoors and wanted a camera that was small but that had a much better zoom lens than my current compact point-and-shoot. I have a small Leica C-Lux 2 that does a great job when photographing scenery up close, but not so good at getting longer distance shots. I found what I was looking for in the GE Power Pro!!First off...the obvious. This camera is not a Canon or a Leica or a Nikon or anything fancy-schmancy and high-end. And, some of you may be saying to yourself, 'Okay self...why would GE want to enter the camera game and is this going to be some low quality piece of garbage that I'll throw away in 2 weeks?' Well...as a nurse, I can tell you that most of the imaging equipment in my hospital's radiology department is made by GE, and the image quality on our equipment is fantastic. My thought was, if they can do a good job with the big stuff like CAT scanners and ultrasonography equipment, then they should probably be able to do a good job with the small stuff like a camera, and they most certainly did!I must say that I was very pleased with the image quality of this camera!! I like the fact that the camera produces clean, high quality images with vibrant color and no annoying 'shake' that can oftentimes happen with a smaller point-and-shoot. It's lightweight but very sturdy, and can easily slip into a backpack or travel bag (unlike some of the digital SLR's that require an entourage to carry the body and telephoto lenses). I posted a few pictures that I took while on a hiking trip as part of the photo mosaic for this review (above) and must say that I was so very pleased at the picture quality and clarity.And the cost! Full disclosure, I bought mine at a 'brick and mortar' store (in my case, Sears) for a cheaper price than offered here on Amazon.com. But for under $150.00 this camera is a bargain!! Another thing that I love about this camera is that it takes four AA batteries, but if you want to save some money on your batteries you can easily use rechargeables!! For some odd reason I found that Energizer's rechargeables work much better in this camera than Rayovac's, but you may find your experience to be different.This camera is probably not going to satisfy those who insist on Canon or Leica or Nikon performance (and at $150 I don't think you can honestly expect that)...but for those of us that simply want a good camera with a powerful optical zoom at a great price, this is a wonderful option!! You won't be disappointed!!""

"20110702","4.0","About What I Expected","The bottom line at the top:  Excellent bang for the buck.  Some of the things you have to give up to get this price are speed, no mount for filters or zoom extenders and it has less than  the zoom of the longest bridge cameras.A couple of nits I'd like to pick, if I may...You get EVF or rear display, not both.  At least it would be nice if it remembered what you used last and turned on in that mode.  As is, if you hold it to your eye while turning on, you get nothing.  If there's something that I missed in the manual (PDF only)  that allows you to default to the EVF, feel free to post a comment, please and thank you.Operation seems like it could be made a little easier.  For example, to go to portrait mode, it's a position on the mode dial.  Unless it's night portrait, in which case it's one of the preset scenes.  Or a back-lit portrait, which is only available in the auto scene select mode.  What I'd like to see, although I doubt anybody does this, is that you set the basic scene type, (portrait, kids, action...) and then a sub-scene for condition, (daylight, back-light, snow...)  Setting ISO should be a quicker process than it is, too.Minor complaints, though.  To me, it doesn't make much sense to get an expensive P/S (unless you're talking an application specific device like for magazine layout) Even the best still have an EVF rather than a through-the-lens optical view finder, sensors that are too small, and with few exceptions, (e.g. the Fuji HS20) no manual zoom and near worthless 'manual' focus.  If your main application is 46 prints to share with family and friends, the 16MP resolution makes the digital zoom actually usable.  If you really need 36 optical zoom, it's available for quite a bit more than the price of this camera, but if you're that serious about photography, an entry-level DSLR, especially if you can get a good deal on an older model, would be the way to go.***A quick update... check out the Fuji S2550.  They look an awful lot alike.  As if this was designed by Fuji to be the bottom of the S2000 series, but they decided there were just too many sacrifices.  Also, I'm getting some strange meta-data mistakes, mostly time and date taken.  I thought maybe the RTC chip was bad or something, but it does keep time correctly.""

"20110627","5.0","More than I expected","I am simply amazed at all the features of this camera. For $155 I got the camera, 8GB SDHC Memory Card(SanDisk is the recommended brand)and a small Zeikos Case which is waterproof/shock resistant.  This is the perfect size for travel.Background on why I selected this camera:I am going to be living abroad for a few months on an internship and I wanted a compact camera with powerful Optical Zoom and Megapixles. I read reviews and countless buying guides. I originally bought the Vivtar T328 but as soon as I got it the touch screen stopped working so I returned it.Just by chance I came upon this GE X500 model. It is built on a Fuji  S series camera(it really looks and feels like a Fuji) for a fraction of the cost. Don't let the GE/General Imaging brand name fool you. The founders of General Imagining retired from Minolta(which is now Sony) and Fuji. This goes to show you that they mean business for this price point.Professional Features:I like to be able to take photos in automatic modes for when I don't have time to plan my photo shoot. But when I have a day to film the big airplanes landing at San Francisco International Airport then I like to be able to set the manual modes.This camera allows me to set aperture and Shutter Priority as well as manual White Balance. I also like being able to set the ISO Settings.Furthermore I love the 27mm wide angle zoom with 15x Optical Zoom. Having only 5x of Digital Zoom says a lot of how professional this camera is. The more optical zoom you can get the better. I tried taking photos and let me tell you they turn out to be so professional just like the expensive Canons.I also like the different scene modes, portrait, panorama, Optical Image Stabilization and both an electronic viewfinder and an LCD screen with automatic brightness control. I like that you can see the menu functions in the Electronic View Finder.The ArcSoft looks like a good software and I will test that out. I recommend that you try it out before going on to the more advanced Adobe Photoshop.  Be creative.In addition I like that I can record movies while I don't need an HD recorder as I have a camcorder its a nice way to record short films of the photos I took. This does not replace your separate camcorder. For avid videographers stick to a movie camera. A lot of the time people want high quality video from an all in one camera.  As long as I can use the optical zoom for shooting video that is enough.I also like that the camera comes with a decent strap/lens cap.  I highly recommend that you buy an 8GB SDHC San Disk Class 4+ Memory Card, Zeikos small carrying case as well as 4 AA rechargeable batters with a charger.I would much rather have AA Batteries over a rechargeable Lion battery as after that goes you have to spend $50+ for a new one.Setup:Setup was easy. I first turned on the camera and set the date and time. Having the World Time feature with a home and travel setting was another important feature that I want.After setting up the date please don't forget to format the SD Card and do this everytime you download the photos to your computer or get a new SD Card as it will optimize the saving to the card.If you need more space on the card lower the resolution to 10 Megapixles.Overall I cannot believe the quality and the price of this camera. When I saw the Fuji S camera today  and tested it out I was amazed at how the GE Camera is so similar for the fraction of the cost. The Fuji Camera was $270 vs $155 for everything.Who is this camera good for:This Bridge Camera is good for those who don't want the extra weight of the DSLR and its interchangeable lenses. With airlines charging a lot for extra baggage this camera can be the 2nd included carry on item as you are allowed one backpack and one personal item.If you want the professional features of a DSLR with the ease of a Point and Shoot Camera this is your best choice.For a novice who wants the manual functions this camera is good for you too. Don't spend the $100 now for a basic point and shoot buy this bridge camera and you will be happy for years to come. Its light and durable.Happy Shooting(:""

"20110624","5.0","GE Power Pro Camera - Good value for the money.","We purchased the GE Power Pro prior to a vacation trip to Canada. We have had it now for slightly over one month and it has worked well for us. We have had only two problems, and even with them, we still give the product a 5-star score because of the excellent value.Problem 1 - nuisance type - the lens cap/cover does not fit tightly enough and as a result is more off than on while we are carrying the camera.Problem 2 - When doing extreme zooming, the view finder doesn't do a great job. The picture turns out well, but in my case, we were trying to photograph a particular individual (my son) in a group of kids walking, and we got excellent pictures of strangers because the resolution on the view finder was not good enough to tell who we were photographing at that distance.""

However, I am going to be traveling abroad and can't seem to force myself to take that camera with me, especially if something happened. With this new camera I paid $150 and it has some of the same capabilities of my SLR camera. It zooms very well and makes pictures farther away move closer of course and they look pretty good. It has a video button and that is something that my other more expensive camera doesn't have.

"20110616","5.0","GOOD CAMERA !!!","I got to know about this camera by chance. I have a 7.2 MP Casio camera which is very good but since my cousin would be visiting me I wanted a new, high MP and Zoom camera for  summer. I first looked at a Casio Model. It was good but not what I wanted. After checking many cameras Fuji, Nikon, Sony etc...I just lost hope. I saw a 16 MP Canon SLR camera and was amazed that there are 16 MP cameras now. So I typed 16 MP in the Amazon search box just to check out the newer models. And bingo !! This camera showed up first in the search. And when I looked at the price , it almost blew me away. I had never heard of GE making cameras before and was very very hesitant. Then I read the reviews, saw videos on Youtube, sent messages to the owners of this camera, read scores of other reviews and ALMOST ALL OF THEM GAVE THIS CAMERA 5 STARS. I was pretty impressed and then decided to buy it. And let me tell you it took absolutely STUNNING pictures.I also showed this camera to one of my friends who knows a lot about cameras and stuff and he was surprised and said that its actually a good camera, and so many features for lesser price. I am still learning how to use it and so far I like it.....Manual settings give you more advanced controls.1. Took a shot at full 15X zoom, came crystal clear.2. Image stabilization is good.3. Lots of scenic modes4. Very easy and accessible features.PS: WHITE COLOUR is freakin' awesome on this camera. Go for it. Plenty of look-alike black cameras out there.TIP: If you want batteries to last longer, then after using the camera just take them out.Check out the pictures I put on the page. They are awesome !!""
"20110613","5.0","Arrived safe a sound quickly from Amazon","This is a great camera for it's rather low price. It's worth more and comparable cameras cost considerably more. I took a few pics of the cat and the images are top notch on par with a professional instrument.""
"20110613","4.0","Liking it so far","Okay, I am not a professional nor amateur photographer and the last time I bought a camera was in 2004, so i will write my review based on a regular consumer's perspective.I just recieved the camera today, and thus have not really had a chance to take many pictures or go through every feature in extent.I read the owners manual, and what I like about this camera is that you have the option to do all auto mode, or once you start getting the hang of taking pics do manual mode and do your own adjustments.Also, the quality of the pictures is really good for a non SLR camera.  My last camera was a digital point and shoot 12MP luminix panasonic and at that time I just wanted a digital camera to capture pictures to my trip to Egypt.  It was more expensive than the GE Pro X500 16MP, lol, so I am really excited that I paid less money for this one and get more than just a point and shoot.  I love it that I can take black and white, sepia, and vivid colors.  I can also remove red eye, rotate, and crop all from the camera. i tried the panorama but I kept getting an error that the picture was not aligned properly even though it was because I followed the instructions, but maybe I just need to play with it more.  The result from my intent of using the panorama was very good actually, so i am happy with that feature as well. Will be even more happier when I get it right thought. lol.Okay let's see, the package comes with the software, the shoulder strap, the lens cap, and the warranty card.  I love the way my hands grip around the camera, it makes me feel secure.  The regular point and shoot I was always worried of dropping them or not getting a steady shot, but because of the way the GE Pro X500 is designed, I can have a nice and steady grip.  There is a feature on the camera to use for unsteady/shaky hands and I tried it out but really didn't see much difference.  I tried the zooming to the max and the image was just not the best it can be and again that is due to my shaky hands, i am sure with a tripod the picture would have been really nice.  I still need to try it out on people though, because from my little tiny experiments on my 4year old who moves around a lot I can see a difference there than from the pictures of inanimate objects or pets. lol...but who knows I still got a lot of time to play with it.  I think once I learn how to properly use all the features of the camera and familiarize myself with the camera I will be able to make the best of it and get the best pics possible.  But so far I am really happy with it.The price was excellent, HSN is selling the same cam with some muble jumble software package, for like 175.00 and so glad I found this one at amazon, and got it for the price of 130. As I write this review I believe the price is 124.99.  I got the black one, although I really wanted the white one, but whatever if both cameras do the same thing the less I pay the better.  I am not dissapointed because the black is not bad at all.Okay well that is all for my review, if run into major damage or awesome discoveries I will update.  I'll upload (if I find a way to) some of the pics i took, like fruits/veggies/ apple tree, my dogs, and a hammock pic for you all to see.  Again I am no pro at this.  If you are looking to upgrade from a point and shoot, this camera is just right.  It will give you the opportunity to play around with the pictures before you throw 500 bucks or more on those SLR cameras that might be overwhelming.I gave it 4 stars out of five because nothing is every perfect and gotta leave a little room for error :)""

"20110611","5.0","Exactly what I was looking for!","I was looking for a camera that was an upgrade over my standard digital point-and-shoot, but didn't need anywhere near all the features of a $900 SLR. I am by no means an experienced or professional photographer, I just wanted a camera that could take quality photos. This is that camera!It's very easy to use, with a quick set-up and easy instructions. The screen is crisp and menu response time is fast. The unit is light in my hands, and the zoom quality is excellent. I recommend the white version, it stands out and really looks like something special. As 99% of the other reviews say, this camera packs a huge punch for the dollar, and it is by far the best deal I could find anywhere.For those of us who are looking for a camera that will make you look like an experienced photographer without having to attend photography school, this is a no-brainer.""
"20110611","3.0","Not bad...but not great, either","I had purchased this specifically because I was doing a lot of hiking during an extended trip, and I wanted more than the 4x zoom on my cheap Nikon Coolpix S4000.  Since at home my wife has a very nice DSLR with multiple lenses, I didn't want to buy a another DSLR or spend a lot of money on a nicer bridge camera.  The previous version of this camera got good reviews, so bought this one just after it had came out.Out of the box, the camera seems pretty solid, although the compact (but FAT) build is a little weird and takes some getting used to.  I initially did a comparison to my $130 12MP Coolpix point-and-shoot, and immediately saw some issues with the photo quality.  Like other reviews have stated, indoor pictures are not great, but actually not as bad as some.  My Coolpix (like most point and shoot cameras) had some problems as well, but the quality was still noticeably better than the GE.  When using the indoor program mode, the shots were acceptable.  The outdoor shots were better, but not super great, either.  Comparing the same shots with my Coolpix, the Nikon had consistently better pictures.While for most this wouldn't be too much of a problem, when viewing the photos and zooming in past 100%, there is significant pixel noise on the GE.  Again, comparing to my 12MP Coolpix, the same shot at the same zoom had significantly less noise on my Nikon than the GE.  Overall, the biggest problem was the inconsistency of the photos.  Even using the same settings only a few seconds apart, there were often differences in the exposure, balance, etc.  My hundreds of outdoor shots were all over the place in terms of quality.  The shots often had a washed-out appearance (which could be fixed in post-processing if necessary).I took the GE on several hiking trips, and took hundreds of photos, using different program modes and settings, which improved the quality overall, but did not eliminate the inconsistency issue.  The zoom was quick and the image stabilization worked very well.  The battery life was excellent (although I did not use the flash too much).  The focus is moderately quick compared to most point and shoot cameras, although slower than my Nikon.  The video mode was poor, but that was expected.  I also used the GE in a couple of museums, and using the Museum program mode, it took surprisingly good shots.  I also toured an indoor wildlife museum, and using the flash it took some very fine pictures.Unfortunately, after viewing all of the pictures, I decided to return the camera.  I don't necessarily want to talk anyone out of buying this...for most casual users, this camera can take good shots, and the 15x zoom is awesome at this price.  For still pictures, outdoor and lit indoor shots, the photo quality is fine (especially using the program modes or manual controls).  To get this level of control and zoom, you're going to be paying over $200 for something else, and probably over $300 for anything really significantly better.  However, as I often print my photos for framing, the inconsistent quality and extreme noise, even compared to my cheap Nikon, left me wanting a bit more.PROS-- 15x zoom works very well- Many different program modes and manual controls, which work well- Great battery life and uses easy-to-get AA batteries- Photo quality can be fairly good under right conditions, and most issues could be fixed with post-processing (i.e. Photoshop, etc.)- Inexpensive for a good zoom and feature packed cameraCONS-- Lots of noise when zoomed in (pixel peeking)- Inconsistent picture quality""
"20110609","4.0","Amazing quality and features for the money","You wouldn't believe me if I write a good reccomendation about this camera. Just buy it and try it yourself. I Have had a Canon S line before, but the price of this article for the features you've gotten is ridiculous. The Image Quality is average compared to panasonic or Canon, but believe me, you don't need anything more expensive to enjoy photography. This is a Swiss army Camera for the half even the third of the price of a similar product.""
"20110606","4.0","A pretty good camera, not a great one","I recently received the GE X500 camera that I ordered and I tried it out for the first time today. It has some neat features like Panorama mode, which allows you to create a panoramic picture with only a few steps. First you set the mode with mode dial on the camera top, then you set whether the shot moves from right to left or left to right, take the first shot, then align the focus marks up and the camera does the rest. This model allows you to choose whether to use the LCD screen or the viewfinder for focusing by pressing a button on the camera back. Sometimes it is easier to focus when using the viewfinder (particularly on long zoom shots). When using the LCD screen on long zoom shots the view is fuzzy, but the picture that is taken comes out sharp. I find that to be annoying because I don't know if the shot is good until it is actually taken. However the camera's 15X zoom allows it a long reach. I can take a picture of a building one mile away and make out details I can't see with the naked eye. The wide angle setting allows me to capture the full width of a nearby hill and then use the zoom feature to show just the peak. It has many other modes that I have yet to explore. This camera is a pretty good value for its price.""
"20110527","5.0","Surprising Quality","I'm a freelance photojournalist who carries around a ton of equipment. After realizing that I have few to no vacation photos, I decided to get an inexpensive camera to take on a recent trip that I could easily pack and carry around without needing a sherpa.Really surprised at how well this camera worked and the quality of the photos. It's been fun experimenting with the settings, I like that it has a little more heft than point and shoot variety. I've even had a couple of photos published from this camera.As long as I don't spend a lot of time reviewing shots, the batteries last. I'm not in love with the macro settings and I need to experiment more with the manual settings. I don't work with video, so I haven't even tried that setting, but I'm glad to have the option.There's a lot of quality here for the price.""
"20110527","1.0","Terrible, don't get duped","Pros:1) It's lite.2) It lets you turn off the sounds.3) It has multiple indicator sound types to choose from.Why I hate it:1) There was some sticky smudge in the corner of the LCD screen (and the screen isn't protected with a film which all cameras come with when new), and when I tried to clean it it made major smudging on the screen.2) The lens extends regardless of whether or not you are viewing images or not, so it sticks out for nothing, it seemed at one point to fully retract while it was on, but I couldn't reproduce that effect.3) The camera can catch massive purple fringing or looked really washed out if you don't give it about a second and a half to adjust. That's not as big deal as what I'm about to say next.4) After spending 30 minutes baking in the sun taking pictures, I find, to my disgust, a bunch of blank jpg files when I went to review my images. And there was with no explanation as to why. When I examined the sdhc card was a bunch of .thm files, which seem to be thumbnail files, but also no explanation what those were there for. I thought maybe I should format the card (big mistake I accidentally erased a ton of images on it from my fuji digital camera) and that still produced all blank files.5) The only pictures I managed to see were ones it was able to take which was from the internal built in memory.6) Examining pics on this thing is almost pointless since the lcd screen res is terrible.7) The camera seemed to be covered in unsightly marks on the plastic when I first examined it, but I decided that they were so numerous and fine that they must be there for gripping purposes, but they are so small and smooth that it ends up just being an unsightly mess, as if plastic got sprayed onto the camera by accident.7) There is no lens thread ,so forget about easy protection of the camera lens.8) Digital zoom is blah.9) It looks and feels like it's below the quality of a $110 pocket camera that you can usually find in Walmart. But, it has the look of a disposable camera, which might be a first for an imitation DSLR. Looks cheap in other words, cheap in an ugly way.Massively disgusted and going to return it. (Make that 'did' return it).""

"20110514","5.0","Fantastic Bridge Camera ^-^","Like most people who are purchasing this camera, I have little or no experience in photography. Although I've dabbled in the arts of Skype and quick pics using my phone, this GE bridge camera is hardly in the same tier. So many features.. so little time..Pros:> Superb picture quality for the price> Myriad of features packed in one> Super ZOOM to the rescue!> Build quality feels legit (ergo, a real, solid camera rather than a cheap toy)I'll go more in depth with the features. My favorite feature is the HDR conversion of photos. After you take a photo, you go to the photo you just took by hitting the > (play) button. Then hit menu and go all the way down. There's an option called 'HDR' which converts your photo to 'High Dynamic Range' quality. Simply put, it enhances the colors of the photo, making it brighter and more vivid. Another great feature is smile detection. Press the little smiling button right next to the 'waving hand' (that's image stabilization which I always have on =]). If you press it once, it will be in face detection mode. Press it twice and you'll see a smiling face on your digital screen instead. Now, press the shutter button and you'll notice it won't actually take any pictures.. until someone smiles! =D My other favorite feature is the panorama mode, of course! I honestly imagined taking panorama photos to be much more arduous but it's quite simple. You start your photo from the left then you just move your camera to the right while lining up the crosses on the screen! Those are my favorite features so far but there are much, much more I personally haven't played with such as manual mode (more for experts where they set aperture and shutter priority).Cons:> Probably the worst problem this camera has are the picture quality of photos taken inside. (Don't worry, the pros outweigh this problem by far)> 'HD' quality videos don't really seem very 'HD'> Wish it came with a camera bag (not really a big deal since I bought one separately but it would've been nice?/ kinda looking for more cons since it's a bit hard xD)> Not really a con, but more of an improvement suggestion.. Maybe for smile detection, instead of having the need to press the shutter button THEN the camera will take the picture, it could be set up so that when smile detection is enabled, the camera automatically takes pictures when they smile. Also, it could be done so endlessly (meaning it takes pictures of people that smile multiple times, over and over).All in all, I am extremely pleased with this purchase. An excellent bridge camera (an in-between point and shoot and DSLR camera) for $140 (which I believe is the most inexpensive bridge camera of this quality out there) is a great buy!Oh on a side note, if you're thinking of purchasing the white version, you won't be disappointed. I personally like the white on this camera. I didn't want it to look just like EVERY other camera out there so I got the white so it could kind of 'pop-out.' Definitely pops out and is pretty noticeable! =]Also, I uploaded some photos for you folks interested in purchasing this product. I demonstrated a little preview of the Panorama mode and HDR setting for you =D""
"20110430","5.0","Very Nice Camera","you can make this camera as easy or as complicated as you want with the complete manual and auto settings. Pretty sweet camera. The panamora is a cool feature it allows you to take 3 pictures and stich them together right in the camera. This feature takes a steady hand and only gets harder the farther you zoom in. The picture quality is superb I cant wait to take it with me on some road trips this summer. I really like this camera. I played with it for hours yesturday the 30th of april (the day I got it)and the batteries never ran dead and they still read full, and thoes are just the batteries that came with it. overall i am very happy with this camera.""
"20110427","5.0","A great starter camera if you want better pics than a point and shoot.","Like many other reviewers I am not a professional photographer, and this is my first digital camera. I do like taking pictures though and I've dealt with a few nice film cameras and some nice Fujifilm cameras (a P&S, 'bridge camera' and a DSLR) and I feel like this camera is most definitely worth the price. The X500 is a bridge camera, almost a SLR and almost a point and shoot. But it boasts some great specs and features that you cannot find anywhere in this price range.Pros. The 16 megapixel sensor is great. Most entry level cameras of any type and brand start off at about 12 MP right now. GE has this model at 16. I think the other 16 MP cameras are over twice the price of this one. You can see the difference when you zoom in on your computer, the clarity is apparent.The zoom on the X500 is awesome. This camera has 15X optical zoom and along with digital zoom (digital zoom takes away image quality as you zoom in so just keep that in mind when using it) it has a total of 60X zoom.The X500 has a panoramic mode which I love because I wanted a panoramic film camera and now I don't have to buy one. This camera also has a setting for everything from fireworks to snow to fisheye. More than just night and outdoors.. there are 20 different presets and thats not including the different modes the camera has for shooting (it has manual, very important!)So far I've taken 100+ pictures and the battery is still full on the display. The manual says it'll shoot 300+ pictures on a set of 4 batteries... thats pretty good.Not a pro for some, but this camera is a bit hefty. I like it because its like you are actually holding onto something. But it is heavier than I thought it would be.Viewfinders are sometimes left out of cameras now because they all have screens, but this one has an electronic viewfinder (for those sunny days) I think thats a nice perk.The video quality is better than I expected, though its not HD. The sound is so-so but thats the case on everything with a recorder.Cons. The screen resolution and quality isn't the greatest (I have a 3 year old Creative mp3 player that has a much nicer screen and it's smaller.) Like most cameras though you look at the screen and its grainy and the color doesn't look quite right but you snap the picture/ upload and it looks like it should when its on the computer screen (or printed out.) I think they had to cut corners somewhere.The lens pops out when you turn it on and the lens cap pops off, even if you just want to look at the pictures on your SD. And I also do not like the lens cap. It just slides on. No clips.The sound effects were annoying, but theres a setting to turn it off (saves your battery anyway.)Not a biggie but the SD slot is in the battery compartment. Just out of the way I guess.The camera is a bit noisy, you can hear the processor working and the internal stuff moving around at times. More of a side note than a con though.Bottom line is I'm not sure how long the X500 will last (because I got it in the mail two days ago) but so far I'm very glad that I bought this camera. It's a lot like Fuji's bridge camera and if you know the menus and buttons from their cameras then this thing will be a snap because its pretty much a carbon copy. The layout is simple enough for a beginner or teen who's looking into photography and it wont break the bank like a nikon or canon with the same specs.""

"20120521","5.0","Works with linux systems","Just received the GE Power Pro X500 with white trim - but forgot to ask for the free 4gb memory - thought Amazon would send if I ordered the camera. So now I am begging Amazon to send me the free memory in another shipment.CAUTION I am a Cannon power shot photographer [s.i.c] - and have been around the world with one in my pocket - just pulled it out and took the picture I wanted. But now I have a granddaughter - and she will not stay still !!  1. VERY GOOD: the shutter is almost instant - and I do not have to say 1, 2, 3 and snap on 2. Works fine for most - but 1.5 year olds are bored at the count of 1. This camera gets the shot off on the snap - and they look good..  2. VERY GOOD: I like close ups - and I held it 5 inches from my nose and to a great picture of every pore, wrinkle, whisp of grey hair and bald spots, not to mention age spots on my face. But it looks good and is more detailed I guess because the 16 megapixl vs 12 on my cannon.  3. VERY GOOD: the camera looks nice.. 4. LINUX VERY GOOD : just pulled the pdf owners manual off the cd and displayed perfectly in ubuntu 12.04 and fedora 16. Also had no problem uploading pictures from the camera to Linux with the default apps on both distro's. And could easily delete pictures on the camera from both linux's.I paid less for this GE than I did for the Cannon - but it looks like a much better camera. Time will tell.""

"20120517","5.0","Excellent camera for the money","I've been playing with this camera for the past few days and at first is very disappointing when you take night pics or' pic of the moon. but once you get to learn how to use the Manual Mode and adjust the Aperture and the shutter speed and you can take some great shots I was even able to take a nice shot of the Big Dipper an it came out clear no distortion at all. I love this camera, I just wish I could remove the lens to adapt it to my scope, but other than that it's a great camera for the money. Also another thing that I like which I thought was a thing of the past is that I can use regular AA batteries in case of emergency,I got this camera as a combo and it came with rechargebles batteries and a charger. I would recommend this camera to friends an families.""
"20120516","5.0","OUTSTANDING","My 11 year old son saved up his money over several months to buy this camera. The day it arrived, he was so excited and began taking pictures of everything. Lots of features for a first camera but I'm sure he will enjoy every minute he uses it. Good stepping stone to some of the nicer more pricier cameras. If you like to take casual pictures or think one of your youngsters has a budding desire for photography, this is a great camera!""
"20120516","5.0","Great little camera","It's not my dream DSLR camera, but since I can't afford my dream camera without taking out a massive loan from my bank, I got this one, and I am LOVING it.  It does everything I need and then some, including what I want it to do.  I've managed to get some excellent shots, and being able to see and preview them on the screen helps me to decide which ones to keep and which to drop, something I couldn't do with my traditional SLR.  As an amateur photographer who does Decorative Art Photography currently only for family and friends, this has been a great investment, and will help me advance and branch out in my work.""

"20120509","5.0","Great camera, great price!","I purchased this camera after reading the reviews.  I have a trip in September I wanted it for.  I wanted a more sturdy camera than some of the petite (yet hefty price tag) point and shoot cameras out there.  This is a great camera with many options to be able to take great pictures.  It is a more advanced camera than your traditional point and shoot (although it will do that too) but the features and options are almost overwhelming.  I had a friend of mine who is a professional photographer go through the options with me to make sure I was prepared for my trip.  She was really impressed with the camera and was ready to go out and get one for herself just because of some of the lens features and the quality of pictures it took.  I would recommend playing with the camera before needing it for important events.""
"20120509","5.0","Fantastic choice!!","This time when i looked for a new camera, i was looking specifically for one that had little to no lag time, (the time between shots).Everyone i looked at seem to have a comment about a long lag time, so i gave up figuring i would get one without. So i just picked the best reviews, the best price and found GE. This camera has nearly no lag time at all, was very happy about that!! It works flawlessly and ive had it about 3 weeks and used it frequently..I did get the white one just because it was different, i like the look and it does not look cheap in any way. GE definently took into account what the feel would be in your hand while using. Feels really solid in my hand and comfortable and easy to use. Will be posting pics, im not a professional but have taken plenty of pics and have tried many of the scene modes.""

"20120506","4.0","Enjoying my camera!","This camera is very comfortable to hold and an excellent choice for someone learning to use a digital SLR style. I like that it has the view finder and what I was looking for taking photos outdoors in the sun. However, surprisingly, I am not finding that I need too often, because the lcd screen is easy to use too. It has very good zooming, but one draw back so far is the ability to perform very close focusing so you have to play with it for close shots. Overall, very pleased with my purchase.""

"20120502","5.0","Great camera for decent price!","I have to say, I did not expect this camera to be that good. But it is.It is very easy to use, and you`ll be able to quickly navigate it.It takes great pictures ones you set it up for proper function.By that, I mean, don`t blame the camera if you are trying to take pictures of flowers, having 'Indoors' set up and etc. It will still take a picture, but the best results come when you use it properly and set the picture themes accordingly.The flash is just amazing. You can be in  a night club in peach darkness and take a clear picture with NO red eyes effect! All the color are right and good.I would definitely recommend this camera for every-day use for those who can`t or don`t want to buy HD Professional camera, like  Nikon or Canon EOS, but want their camera to be a little more professional than regular slim DSLR.Use it properly and it will provide you with great images!""
"20120502","5.0","Great camera!","I love this camera..it takes great pictures..my only issue is the 'media impressions' software for editing photos that came with it, if you dont use the 'auto enhance' button to adjust contrast and lighting and try to manually do it yourself, the picture looks great on the screen, but when you have them printed, it creates black splotches all over the photo, so be aware. Otherwise, this camera does everything i wanted and was a great deal, i would definitely recommend it.""

"20120427","5.0","Love this camera - Amazing Featues","Easy to operate but more features than my $800 Pentax ... GE camera has wide angle and amazing zoom plus smile recognition, and will focus on 6 people at diffent distances, shoot 3 pictures and it will put them together in a panorama. This camera coompany, in my minf, has become the leader in innovation overnight. They even have a camera that will project on a wall up to 72' diagonal and it is a pocket camera.... camera has a built in projector and camera is the size of a deck of playing cards.  This camera is larger but not as bulky as most SLR's, about at least 1/2 the size, probably more like 1/3 the size.While most cameras have around 10 scene types like flowers, sports, mountains, etc ... this camera has an amazing 20 different scene types that are easily selected on the lcd screen.  My first pictures of flowers up close were the best of any camera we own and we have a high end Canon as well as a high end Pentax. I just stumbled on this camera on Amazon and glad I ordered it.  The CD has the manual on it and the software drivers automatically install when you plug the USB cord in the first time.  Flawless interface to the PC and easy to use.Oh, and they think of everything, even have a cord on the lens cap that attaches to the camera so you don't lose the lens cap, we had to buy this type of chord for our Canon and Pentax.At first you may think the view finder does not work, so be sure to push the evf/lcd to switch between the electronic view finder and the lcd, this was confusing at first but I figured it out.  So this is not a point in shoot camera but a slr since you view thru the lense and get all the lcd settings in view through the electronic view finder, even my expensive $800 Pentax does not do that.  Great camera!""
"20120427","3.0","GE X500 Ok.","This camera is ok.  As someone who is perusing photography as a hobby, this camera is eh.  I like the features such as the shutter priority, aperture and Manual modes.  Having a view finder in addition to the LDC screen is very nice.  Especially when you are trying to stabilize your camera a little more without using a tripod.  It has 16 megapixels and the 15X zoom is nice also.That said, There are some major issues I have with this camera.  The first is the lens cap.  You can't keep the darn thing on which if extremely frustrating when you are out and about and are like me and ALWAYS have your camera on you.  You can't adjust your image size on the camera, so it takes pictures in 72ppi with extremely large dimensions (i.e. 64x36 inches) which is incredibly frustrating.  I would much rather have pictures at 300ppi and re-size it to a smaller resolution rather than the other way around.  As other reviews have said, it isn't that great in low light settings.  Grain is a MAJOR issue with this camera. Even in manual mode, adjusted properly, it still is a problem. That said, it is possible to take decent pictures indoors, but you need A LOT of light.Overall, its an ok camera. It's Good if you would like to learn on it (which I am doing. However, if you are purchasing this to upgrade before you get a DSLR, I would recommend just buying the DSLR.  If you are looking for something a little fancier than your point-and-shoot, spend the extra money.""
"20120427","5.0","Loved it.","I love this camera. But was a little upset after I brought it the price dropped. From $138 to $117. A little upset.""
"20120425","5.0","Great little camera for the price","I'm a semi professional photographer so I know a thing or two about cameras. I have to say this little thing surprised me. I bought it for my girlfriend as a anniversary present as she loves photography and she wanted me to teach her. I didn't want to spend to much in case she changes her mind but I still wanted to get her something that had all the settings and features that she would need to learn. The camera is slightly slow though I'm used to a big nice DSLR so anything that isn't a DSLR is slow to me. There is a slight delay when the shutter is pressed but not as bad as some P&S(point and shoots) I have used and once you get used to it you wont notice it. It takes the camera a second to get back to the screen to take another picture but a lot quicker then I expected as most P&S take a few seconds to save the photo and get ready to take another picture. The image quality is actually pretty good though at higher ISO's like 800+ it starts to get a airbrushed look from the noise reduction that is used in the camera but still it does get rid of the noise. Also at ISO 1600 and 3200 it lowers the megapixels to 4mp so don't use those unless you have too. The images are surprisingly sharp for a cheap P&S like this the colors it produces are nice too. It has a lot of nice scene modes which seem to work pretty good. The panorama feature is great and does a great job of helping you line of the next photo. So in short the cameras is slightly slow but better than other P&S other there. It's produces nice images with good color. ISO 1600 and 3200 are useless and should only be used if you need to get that one picture that you can't get any other way. Has a lot of nice features that you wont find in a lot of the cameras at a similar price. I recommend this to Anybody that is looking to get started in photography and needs that first camera or is just looking for a nice Cheap P&S with good zoom to have for vacations and family photos. I do not recommend this to a serious photographer that is looking for something that they can leave their DSLR at home for.P.S. The white one is beautiful doesn't have that ugly texture all over it like the Black one does. I have a GE X5 myself that I keep in my car in case I see something I really need to get a photo of and don't have my DSLR gear with me and it has that ugly texture on it and I hate it. So get the White one or Even the red, or purple one if you can find them for sale.""
"20120425","5.0","Happy","I am new to cameras/taking pictures and I don't plan to do more than take photos of my boyfriends kids for his facebook page, etc.  I wanted the highest zoom I could get with 16 MP as close to $100 as possible.""

ATTENTION!!!!!!!!! Don't let that make you look at other cameras because its a very minor con, it takes very nice pictures even when the lights are dim without the flashA little extra review:The best part about this camera is the zoom. It can make something you think will come out blurry, terrific. This is a great camera for a beginner or even for someone experienced. I for one am a first time camera user and it satisfies all needs. I haven't experienced any problems with this camera. You can't much better for this price. It really is amazing.""

"20120414","2.0","There are problems with this unit!","I have several other cameras, including a high-end Canon DSLR.  I wanted something I could carry in my car and not worry about it being stolen or beat-up. This camera, although it says General Imaging (GE), is a Chinese-made generic camera that several companies sell under their own brand.  When it works, it's fine.  Unfortunately, it doesn't always work.  The design is a poor one.  You have to turn it upside-down to take the SDHC card out.  When you do, the 4AA batteries will fall out.  Battery life tends to be very poor.  This unit soaks up energy quickly.  Optically, it's not bad.  Look around.  You should be able to find this new for under $100, but I would go for the Casio Exilim, a much better camera at about the same price.""

"20120406","5.0","An Amateur's Review","I had no idea GE made cameras until I spotted this one on Amazon a couple weeks ago and to be honest, the price appealed to me more than anything. I'm not a professional photographer, but I like to take pictures & want them to have quality when I do. So I knew I wanted my next camera to be a bridge camera. It's that healthy combonation of being able to take wonderful pictures without breaking the bank! I looked around for about a week at Nikon, Sony, Canon, Fujifilm, etc. None of these big name camera distributors make a bridge camera with this much of a bargain. So I'm glad I found it!Here are my points of interest-Shipping was pretty prompt (I ordered Sunday, it arrived today, Friday).-Unboxing & setting up was fairly easy. I had no problem loading batteries & a memory card.-I chose white. I was worried it might be a little tacky, but it in actuality has a very sleek, clean, professional look. Seems very well put together.-Like others have reviewed, it has a healthy amount of weight to it, so it feels like you're holding on to something.-I love the button placement & overall anatomy. Easy to grip & take the actual picture. Zoom is located around the capture button, which I LIKE! The LCD display has a sharp & clear quality. A fair size as well, in my opinion.-Very impressed with shutter speed & image stablelization. I have bad nerves, so I'm a bit shaky and need a camera that will help me get a straight, clear shot. So yeah, on the mark with that one.-Nice amount of features & perks like panoramic, scene selection, smile detection, etc.-Easy navigation through settings & preferences like language, time, memory format, etc.I've only used the cam for a day, but as I said before, I'm very impressed. You can NOT beat the specs for the price. If you're on the fence about buying, BUY & TRY.""

I am unable to get to the photo without plugging the camera in each time, even after the photos have been downloaded. I am hoping that it will get easier with time. I also downloaded the free stuff and it suddenly changed my wallpaper, screen saver and I keep getting ads popping up for me to buy things.Maybe it's me. The camera itself is great.

For those with a little more experience you'll find all the cool extra features a fun way to explore possibilities with your photos. Most of my pictures come out crystal clear and some are darn near professional quality.You should get the rechargeable batteries as suggested by other reviewers especially if you take a lot of photos. The camera is a little chunky compared to some digital cameras out there, but the strap that is included with this camera is a big help. As far as the lens cap, well it isn't an issue for me at all. It stays on fairly well. It has a looped string attached to it so I just ran that through the camera's strap metal hinges and when I am ready to take a picture, it pops off and I don't have to worry  about losing it. All in all a good camera for the money.""

The more you zoom the more noise the camera makes, and it really takes piss poor pictures in some of the modes, if i had it to do over i would not buy this camera and if i would have learned sooner i would have tried to return it but i thought it would be ok after using it a few times, and i was WRONG it makes more and more noise the more i use it, so BEWARE this may look like a good deal BUT it has more downs then up's in my opinion, and i would warn you to look around more before you purchase this camera.""

My only complaint is that the user guide is on a cd! i have a mini 10.1 inch screen netbook so i have no disk drive so i'm gonna have to see if i can find tis and tricks on google to get the most out of this camera. but thats not a deal breaker, i'd still recomend this camera to any one who wants better quality than you get with a standard point and shoot but maybe doesn't have the money to throw down on a DSLR camera. I am very happy with this camera, I have been inlove with the camera my husband took with him overseas (i've had it for 5 years) but its got compitition for sure!

"20120227","4.0","4 STARSSSS","I purchased this camera recently Here at Amazon. The reason I took a risk is because one of the reviews stated that it worked great as long as you choose the right settings. I agree 100% that you cannot take this camera out of the box and expect it to take a good picture. You must know when to use the flash and what setting to choose (indoor, outdoor, motion, etc). You must also change the size of the pictures and buy a memory card if you want more than 4 pictures . If the thought of this is too much, then don't buy the camera. However the picture quality is great once you get the hang of it. Because it's not the most user friendly camera available, I can only give it 4 stars.""

It allows you to adjust just about every aspect of how the picture is shot or for beginners like me it does it for you by selecting which mode you want to use. The LCD screen is a bit grainy but once the picture is shot, it clears up and makes a beautiful picture. The shake control is sort of hit and miss but did help alot once I learned the correct way to hold the camera. The zoom is fantastic! I was able to get some great moon shots. I've been using it pretty much constantly since I got it and over all I'm very pleased with it. Only complaint....battery life kinda sucks. I've gone threw 3, 4 packs of batteries since I got it at the beginning of Feburary. If you buy this camera...which btw is very competivly price, other camera's with these specifications cost sometimes 3x as much...I definately suggest buying rechargable batteries, or you'll spend a fortune in them. A fun camera to use, I definately recommend it to beginners!""

Prior to this, I had spent over 200 for a Kodak camera that crapped out after less than a year, and had been using my old Nikon coolpix from 2004. I am extremely happy with my purchase! I am still learning the settings, but am totally impressed with the zoom of this camera at it's price range. It took beautiful pictures of my daughter at the park, even on a less than sunny day in winter. Only complaint I have is I am having a heck of a time finding the right bag for this camera, it's kind of an in between size. But I still love it!""

I've been doing photography for almost 13 years, I can tell which is bad or good, if compare it to my beloved A490 side by side, well, this camera is not even beat Canon A models, not even Nikon or sigma DP1, GE X500 take 4 AA batteries and MOST canon  A take 2.""
"20120206","5.0","GE Power Pro X500-Bk 16 Mp is a great camera","I love this camera. It's the best one I have ever used. I read some of the one star reviews on this and wonder what happened in shipping, the only reason i say this is because mine was in a larger box with only one packing bubble to cushion it. By the time it arrived the bubble was popped so i know the camera was banging around in there during shipping. Luckily it was not damaged and i have had no problems with it. I had a little trouble at first with blurry pictures but if you try all the different settings you will find the right one to use for different lighting conditions or anything. The macro function and portrait setting are my favorites. I did not like the smile detector, it didnt work very well and a few times it took pics when my kids were screaming their heads off, which its safe to say they werent smiling. Overall for us average joes who are not majoring in photgraphy its a good buy and a great camera.""
"20120205","3.0","A good camera for the money","This camera has all the bells and whistles I wanted. Viewfinder, 16MP, great optical/digital zoom, panorama with easy stitch, video all kinds of modes and options. A wonderful starter digital camera. But I was disappointed with the photographic results. It just does not produce the kind of picture I expect from a 16MP camera. For me, in the end its all about the bang of the picture. I want a bright, sharp, crisp photo. This camera just didn't do it for me. But for the money, it cannot be beat!""

"20120128","3.0","Not bad. Not completely sold yet.","Looks pretty good, but i'm not quite sure what to make of a GE camera. Has worked well so far, sharp and balanced lighting.  Flash doesn't cause too much glare in the images. It's an affordable alternative to Canons but I'll wait awhile to post a more detailed review.  Right now, it's working as advertised on most of the basic functionality.""

If you don't know photography take your time and you will learn, if you do know photography this is definitely for you.  The best picture quality I have ever seen.  Love it!! Recommend it to everyone.""

"20120119","5.0","Just saying, WOW WHAT A CAMERA!","If you are familiar with Fugi S series, this is pretty much a replica without the huge price tag. I am totally in love. No, it is not a SRL so don't purchase thinking it will compensate. This camera is pretty much fool proof on auto scene select. I just can't believe it. Beautiful clean pictures for the fraction of a big costly set up.""

"20120119","4.0","Love it, just wish it had the SD card","Don't forget to buy the SD card to go with this camera.  It would be nice if consumers didn't have to buy so much seperate, makes gift giving a chore at times.  However, this camera takes AWESOME pics.""
"20120119","1.0","NOT ALL THERE","This was pictured  on the website with a carrying case and tri pod. It did not arrive with such items. The camera work beautifully but to be honest if I had known the additional items pictured in advertisement were not included I would have made another choice""
"20120113","5.0","AWESOME","Very happy with purchase and it was pretty fast shipping.  Like the fact that there are still responsible sellers out there and what they promise is what you get.""
