Does anyone know what size filter is used on this camera?  I want to purchase a UV/Skylight filter to protect the lens but I can't seem to find the correct MM size.  Some say 52mm while others say 67mm.  The Nikon forum (web page) had asked this question and the Nikon moderator said that filters are not available for the P510.  If this is the case, why is there a thread opening on the lens. Any help or information would be appreciated.""

"20120607","5.0","Nikon P5100 - Great Versatility in a Compact Size","I purchased this camera only weeks before leaving on a cruise/tour to Alaska.  While I had limited time to learn the use of all its features, it worked great in 'auto', and most of the features are similar to those of other such cameras.  I bought the camera because of its 42Xs optical zoom would make it ideal for travel and possibly make it useful for birding.  The camera it replaced had only a 15Xs zoom which I increased to about 30Xs with a rather cumbersome conversion lens.  I also found the buttons for various features more conveniently placed on this camera than on the one it replaced.While I have not had a chance to review all the pictures taken on my recent trip, it does seem that I have deleted fewer pictures due to camera shake and poor focus than those with my previous camera.  Overall it was great.If I had one criticism of it, it would be that it takes too many seconds to power up.  But this would probably be true for any digital camera.""

"20120605","4.0","Coolpix P510","Loving this camera, but haven't figured everything about it out yet.  What I can say is that I took my son to view some bald eagles in the wild and we could not even see them in their nesting area with the naked eye, but the super-zoom on this camera allowed us to take some nice pictures.  Not close-ups because of the distance but we could indeed see and photograph the birds.  I gave the camera 4 stars because in less bright daylight, I seem to have a 'haze' over my pictures BUT that may well be user error--I am not a pro photographer.  Also, you must remember to manually open the flash on this camera which is not a huge deal, but can be a minor annoyance.  I may not be a pro, BUT the pictures in daylight conditions turn out about as good as if I were a pro.  Overall, love the camera--probably the nicest point-and-shoot you can get.For another perspective of the zoom, I stood at my office building which is  elevated above street level and took a photograph of cars parked a block or so away and could zoom in and read the license plate #s and bumper stickers easily.Seller's shipping was prompt; packaging was appropriate.""

"20120530","4.0","Compact in size, good grip and good pictures","This is our first super zoom camera, up form our usual point and shot.  We were not ready for the SLR and the weight of of lenses.  So for amateur photographers, what do we think after playing with the camera for a couple of months:Pro1. Love the handle of the body, very compact, good rubber grip and relatively light given the lense;2. There is a zoom on the left side of the lense: love it since we noticed the zoom function is a lot smoother than when using the usual zoom button;3. Quality of pictures were very sharp even when using the zoom to its max.  Especially with a blue sly backdrop, we were amazed with the contrast of the subject matter.4. Video was less impressive, could be quite grainy when using the zoom to the max:5. The screen dispaly has a feature where it can extend such that when you are taking a picture/video of a subject high up, it permits your head to stay level without over craning your neck!  A plus.  Or if you want to take a picture over a crowd!6. Certainly a great camera for the price and we looked at the Sony at the time and it couldn't compete with the design and features. Great step up for someone who had a point and shot!Con:  just one for us, we found the view of the subject matter on the display and what was actually taken was a little off and we had to comepensate for it when we were taking apicture.  The actual picture was lower by a centimeter from what you view on the display.  Not good.""

"20120525","5.0","I think my search is over","I have gone through about 6 P&S cameras in my quest for the perfect camera that doesn't require buying and switching lenses. I have had the Canon PS S2, several Elph, the PSt SX20IS , the PS S95, all in my quest for compactness and versatility. This is the first Nikon I have had and I must say, I really like it. I read many head-to-head reviews comparing this to the Canon SX40 but decided to go with this because of its more compact body. One reviewer complained that the menu wasn't elaborate enough but i appreciate its straightforward simplicity. But the best part of this camera is, of course, the superzoom. I have gotten amazing detail on long distance subjects with no visible shake. And what is equally satisfying is its ability to take a good macro. The only drawback I have found so far is the lack of an out of camera charger, but I found an aftermarket pack with 2 batteries that will fill the bill nicely. This camera is a little more expensive than the Canon but to me it is worth it.I've noticed that many of the criticisms about this camera are directed at its video capabilities. Since that was not important to me, it did not affect my decision. You have to determine what your priorities are in making your final selection.""
"20120525","5.0","Shell-Shock Amazing","I bought this camera to use the 1920X1080 Video for Digital Art, But was astounded at the other capabilities of it.The Macro is amazing, creating a great feeling of depth and focus, the slow motion video is low res, but is great for things like reviewing stunts and hi speed movement.The zoom, of course, is also stupendous.I can get Macro-like images of a wasp that's six feet away, (a good thing since I'm allergic) and it also works for capturing birds on telephone wires up to thirty feet away in great detail.All in all I'd recommend this camera for anyone, the picture quality rivals that of the Nikon SLR that we have, and the zoom is really an extra feature more then a crucial component to me, but think of of this. the zoom (42X) is more powerful than a lot of binoculars.I also love the digital viewfinder, which lets me take, review, even delete, pictures outside in bright sunlight.If you want a camera that can do almost anything, this is it.""

"20120524","4.0","Received my P510 today!","Well, after ordering my candy red P510 on May 14, the items just arrived today sitting on my front porch after returning from work.  I quickly opened the long box (too long for holding just the camera and a couple of 16G Transcend SD memory cards).  My very first impression after getting it out of the camera box was that the quality, as far as feel-wise, wasn't as good as it looks which was disappointing.So I looked under the camera and lo and behold, 'Made In China'... figures.In any event, it didn't have the quality feel of metal casing, but on the other hand this lightens the load.  Can't have your cake and eat it too I guess!Had to charge the Nikon battery and it only took about 2hrs.  I guess it was half charged already as the manual states that it takes approximately 4.5hrs to charge a fully exhausted battery.The zoom was exactly as advertised. I was going to get myself a good set of binoculars, but figured I would kill two birds with one stone and get a new camera out of it.  No disappointment here.  In our backyard, our neighbor happens to be a cow farmer and the land is about 10 acres of green pasture with trees in the far yonder.  I was able to use my zoom to, for the first time, get a better look of the lay of the land after living here for about 3 years.Just awesome.Under low lighting, it was able to take clear, crisp pictures, which was impressive.  I didn't get a camera bag yet.  Just wished that the lens cover is attached to the camera (at least come with an option to allow you to tether the cover to the camera).  I just know that I will lose that cover.  Almost did it in my first 30 mins of owning this camera too!In any case, I know that this is too early to give a proper review the camera; I just want to put this out there on my first impressions with the camera, out-of-the-box.""

The only con I have with this camera is you can't put a filter lens on it or a lens hood...  (I did however take a Koolie Cup Holder and cut the bottom off and slip it over the the lens and and that helps some with extremely bright sun shots.)

The AF system worked flawlessly and quickly, all of mypictures were taken on the fly, without the use of a tripod...I will confirm the reports of battery depletion, often without muchwarning, usually after taking video images.I heeded the warnings on the Amazon and other camera site reviews andpurchased backup batteries to carry with.Overall I am very impressed with my selection of the p510 in candy apple red, return to the Nikon brand.""
"20120518","5.0","Excellent multi-use companion camera","For a number of years, I've been using Digital SLR cameras.  Unfortunately, they are very inconvenient when out and about, and their short zoom length means that you spend a lot of time trying to crop photos later.  In order to get really good photos at any distance, you need to carry thousands of dollars of equipment, which isn't particularly convenient at major theme parks with mouse themes.  All this means that many of my more important family photos ended up on my Canon Elph 110.  It's a good camera for the size, but isn't what you want for taking photos that you may want to enlarge or frame on your wall.  So, I've spent months trying to find the perfect camera for carrying when traveling, etc.  I've actually purchased two of the small, exchangeable lens cameras, but didn't feel like they were that much more convenient.  They also had the problem of a relatively short zoom length, and photo quality still wasn't close enough to SLR to make them a good value compromise.I finally purchased the Canon G1X, due to the large CMOS sensor.  I still didn't have any zoom, but I felt like the photo quality would be good enough for later cropping.  Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed with the actual quality of the images.  For a camera close to a grand, I was very disappointed.  I'm not sure the quality was any better that that of my Elph.  Finally, I broke down and tried a couple of mega-zooms.  I was quite skeptical due to the smaller sensors, and felt sure that even close up photos wouldn't really work.  As it turns out, this camera was a good compromise.  For me, this camera makes sense.  The photo quality is excellent, and shooting time is very fast.  The HD video is very good, and allows for captures of up to 30 minutes of video at a time.  If you take your time and shoot well, you can get excellent quality photos, even in relatively low light.  With a little bit of enhancement, (with Adobe lightroom, for example), you can get some stunning photos that can still look great when enlarged.  I would go so far as to say that a professional photographer could take photos with this camera that would appear to be SLR quality.On the other hand, when you're shooting quick photos in action situations, (birthdays, holidays, etc.), you get much better photos than I've ever seen with point and shoots.  This is one camera that does a good job with photos and video, making it a perfect travel companion.  I'm sure that purists will find plenty of flaws, but after trying, (and purchasing), at least five cameras in the last year, this is the one I expect to stay with for quite some time.  It's not perfect, but it may be the perfect compromise, at least among what's available in May, 2012.""

"20120517","4.0","Decent camera for a non-DSLR","I bought this camera as a second camera, with the Nikon D90 as my primary camera.  Okay, so it's not a DSLR, which I definitely prefer, but it suits my needs for ordinary shots and when I don't want to drag the D90 around.  First impression is that the body seems a little cheaply made and I'm not crazy about the red color, but I'm comparing it to the D90 which was three times the price. I can live with the cheaper feeling plastic body as long as the photos are decent and I have some control over settings.  It's much lighter than my D90 and smaller, too. Works well on Auto, but there's lots of options and settings to be used, too.  GPS works great but I doubt that I'll use it much.I liked the choice of being able to look through a viewfinder instead of at the LCD screen as I prefer viewfinders, especially in bright sunlight.  Using viewfinder also saves on battery power.  The only problem is that the viewfinder is very small and not that clear, even with the diopter tuned to my vision.  I'm getting used to it, though.As for the telephoto/zoom lens, yes, the more you zoom in, the more shaky the view will be.  I find that happens even with my D90.  Tripods should be used for telephoto shots, anyway.  I'm having a bit of a problem with getting used to the zoom only because I'm used to manually zooming by turning the lens barrel, but after using the camera a little more I'm sure I'll get used to the differences.Comparing the photos to the D90:  okay, the D90 is sharper upon magnification, but the P510 does a really nice job for a camera 1/3 the price of the D90.  I may update this review after using the camera for a couple months, but at this point, I'm happy with it.  I'm not so happy that the price dropped $30 within a couple days after I bought it, though!I recommend this camera for those who want a bridge camera... more than a point 'n' shoot, but without the bulk, expense and confusion of a DSLR.  Also good for those, like me, who want an affordable backup camera.""

"20120517","4.0","Initial Use Review","I bought the P510, though looking to replace a P&S ZS-1 Panasonic that I still love (but has a scratched lens). I like zoom, and this Nikon has it. P510 is light, small, has a good grip feel--I added a hand strap in lieu of the neck strap. I bought it with the recommended bag, which was a great purchase.There's a big bag of features on all new cameras and I find, for myself, most of the ones tried on the P510 are useful: auto scene, shutter, aperture and program settings I find myself using so far. Most of the time it focuses, but like another reviewer said, it can be maddening when it won't focus, especially at the long end. Maybe we're expecting too much.It's the battery life that's bothersome. It will just shut down w/o warning because the battery meter in the upper right of screen will indicate full battery life, but it 'taint so. I'm buying some Wasabi battery back-ups. Don't expect 200+ shots on a charge when you're moving that lens in/out and using the screen. I use EVF to try to spare the battery, though it's not the best.I'm still assessing shot quality. I'm not 'thrilled', but since most of what I shoot goes on the web, I don't require razor sharp. I'm keeping my D90 when I'm seeking crisp.""

"20120514","2.0","Beware.","I am not an easy video reviewer. Simple things annoy me. Even so, I don't think I can take a pill to make me say good things here. What really annoys me about this camera is a pair of oversights or defects. I normally use big Canon expensive stuff and so going Nikon was because I was nudged by the neat things this camera could do at low cost (and size). OK.Huge steady zoom. See? That's the BIG come on. Why this camera? Red? Geez. No. Big steady zoom. OK. But no manual focus and the bazillion feature autofocus that does so many things doesn't do the main thing - keep the camera in focus as you zoom. In fact if you zoom way in then you have about 50% chance of being hugely out of focus. Monkey focus? Shiny objects seem to distract the autofocus. So when the violinist is just off line of a trumpet, forget about getting her face.Fast speed video! Well who takes fast speed video? People who want stop action. Let's see if that ball was inside the line. Shouldn't fast speed video have a fast shutter speed? You'd think. I thought. No. Lots of motion blurred images. - AND _ the 120fps is 3:4 ratio. Ooot? Hmmm?OK how about the Progressive 1080 - progressive is a mode that screams stop action...sooo? No. Even slower shutter speed with horrible blur of moving objects. The STAR 1080p.. same.So it is a bridge camera after all. A slightly big camera that acts totally like a small useless camera. Nikon, be ashamed. Be very ashamed.""
"20120514","5.0","Great Camera--Even With Flaws","I waited almost 6 weeks to get this camera at a reduced price and it has been well worth the wait.  The reference manual alone is over 260 pages long, but if you plan to take shots using other than Intelligent Mode, it's worth the read to familiarize yourself with this camera and its many functions.  I've read the previous reviews on this forum...the criticisms centered around focusing problems, stability at the zoom's far ranges, short battery life, difficulty downloading shots using a memory card and motor sounds that can be heard during playback while panning during motion picture photography.  I'll go over each one.  I took shots of birds in our backyard utilizing the the zoom at full range.  I was able to get clear shots of the bird feeder but in order to get a clear shot of the sparrows, I had to focus elsewhere.  I was able to take these shots without using a tripod, something my old Olympus 800UZ from two years ago could not do because using the zoom at maximum would cause instablity.  In short, I had no stability problems using the Nikon, but to get the autofocus to hone in on a small bird, I had to focus on something else for it to work.  Although I've experienced similar problems with the Sonys, Panasonics, Olympus and Samsung digital cameras I've owned in the past, the Nikon autofocus problem was only resolveable if you focus on another object.  I tried motion picture shots of the same birds in the yard, panning in and out without hearing any discernible motor sounds during playback, which means the motor problem mentioned in earliler reviews has been corrected, or the sound mentioned was barely discernible to begin with.  As far as battery life goes, I have sadly come to the conclusion that this may be correct.  The original battery with the lower MaH rating(storage capacity) lasted for several days and conked out without much notice.  I used an aftermarket battery as replacement with a higher MaH rating and it didn't last more than a few hours on a full charge.  Using the EVF, editing features, autofocus without taking a lot of shots can drain your battery quickly even with the power saver set at 30 seconds to go in standy mode.  By the way, using a higher rated battery also means it will take longer to charge that battery, in much the same manner as having a larger gas tank on your car takes longer to fill than a smaller one.  A word about battery chargers:  It is not necessary to use the supplied camera cable to charge your batteries in-camera.  Ebay has higher rated batteries and wall chargers that also charge your batteries using a ciagarette lighter in your car, a handy accessory if you're down to your last spare battery while on a road trip.  It is not necessary to use the supplied camera cable to computer port to download photos.  I've found that an SCHC memory card reader can also read and download photos to your hard drive, although using the Nikon software supplied with the camera to download your photos is slow and cumbersome.  I used Webshots desktop and downloads take a fraction of the time but with drawbacks:  There are no editing features like the Nikon software on Webshots, and motion picture photos taken on the memory card will not download using this method, nor can you use the many editing features included in the Nikon software even if you download videos using Real Player.  There is no in-camera guide to explain various functions like my Oly had, and it would take another camera bag to lug around the 260 page instruction manual that can be downloaded from the Nikon web site.  The sweep panorama is a technological breakthrough compared to the assist panorama (also an available option here) which requires the user to take up to 3 separate photos while panning across 180 or 360 degrees and using a floating target to ensure the pictures are stitched together correctly by the camera's computer.  The net result often was that photoshopped or stitched together look instead of the smooth look you get from the sweep panorama function.  The in-camera GPS function is only good when you're outdoors and able to get GPS signals. To make a GPS log, the camera's reference manual tells you to download it from their web site using a card reader and a memory card every week or two.  Click on the My Computer link before you insert the card reader so you can determine which removable drive it can be found on your computer.  If you download it to your desktop, right click your mouse and transfer the file to the removable drive on your computer where the memory card is located.  If you click on one of those two drives while the card reader is insterted, you can see the NCFL folder where the info is being stored.  Right click your mouse on the file created by the download and drag it to the NCFL folder.  Insert the memory card into your camera and your camera will update the A-GPS file in about two minutes.  Two years ago, I thought we had seen the last of the EVF, but Nikon has brought it back.  For those that prefer a monitor for composing shots, it is adjustable for those hard to reach shots at concerts.  If you still prefer the convenience of AA batteries instead of Lithium-Ion, I see no evidence that any major camera manufacturer plans a return to that standard again now or in the near future.  I would have preferred a time-lapse photography function, but given the numerous features included here, I won't quibble.  While I have no intention of retiring my tripod, I won't have to use it as much for wildlife shots and sunrises and sunsets from Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park.  I've never owned a Nikon before, but after this camera, I will give serious consideration to owning another one in the near future.  I just hope next year's model can resolve the autofocus issue encountered in the P510.""

"20120513","5.0","Great portable flexible camera","I used the camera on a recent trip involving portraits, wildlife in the wild on the move, scenery, flower close ups and just great scenes.  It handled all.  The low battery indicator is not that obvious and did not appear to come on very long at all before shutting the camera down; but with two charged batteries never had to worry about shooting all day with GPS recording on (I would avoid GPS tracking because of the battery drain, as Nikon suggests).It would be nice if the A-GPS file updating could be done without removing the memory card; the A-GPS file must be kept up to date for any chance of reasonably quick GPS location acquisition.  The P510 got a GPS fix (with an up to date A-GPS file) faster than my 4 year old hand held Magellan Triton pure GPS device, but not as fast as my Droid Cell Phone (which 'cheats' by using the location the cell phone carrier provides as an initial guess of location).  Nikon's software made it easy to check the GPS locations and then easily fix any poor GPS location info.The picture quality is all I could hope for and I will use it to add to the 50,000 pictures I have already taken.  It is small and light enough to haul all over (just don't get it wet).""

"20120505","5.0","Nikon P510","A friend had recommended the P510 and since my wife and I were going to Italy I wanted a new camera so I took the advise. The camera has everything you could need and if you're a novice, the auto feature makes it easy to operate. I was amazed at how powerful the 42:1 optical zoom is and is great on those far away shots. On the backside, the macro feature allows you to get within an inch of the subject. GPS on a camera? Who would have thought of that? Also, while on my trip, I had at least 4-5 people ask me about the camera as that candy apple red color is pretty cool. Want a great camera that is easy to operate and has a ton of features for around $400? This is it.""
"20120504","2.0","Good but....","Bought this camera mainly for its gps function, long zoom, and panorama functions.  The gps system was extremely disappointing, I hike and backpack and always wanted to know my precise location. I did a short 7 mile hike and the gps unit lost satellite half way through the hike and never did regain the signal even under clear skies, my personal gps unit never loses tracking.  Why pay for this function when it is not reliable. Tried using panorama stitch assistant, this when compared to my older canon, was very hard to see in bright light.  Cannot zoom the when using the move the camera panorama function.  Tried this camera out for about a month but was not overly impressed.""
"20120504","5.0","great camera","Bought this for my husbands birthday, he now thinks i am pretty cool.  Great, just as clear on 42x zoom as on wide angle.  Takes better pics than my canon slr with all the lens and much easier to carry around. Bought it to use at concerts and sporting events where they wouldn't allow the removable lens but now use it for everything as its so good. Great for wildlife also. Only complaint would have been the battery charging system but i knew ahead of time and bought the 2 extra batteries and charger from amazon for $19.95 so always have charged batteries. Couldn't be more pleased.""
"20120429","3.0","Great Pics; Great Flaws!","I wanted a good carry around camera that was smaller than my D7000. I had high hopes for the P510, but it let me down in a big way. It takes really vivid landscape pics. The camera takes lowlight landscape pics that rival my D7000. No kidding. The big flaw is focus time. It takes this camera for ever (i.e. sometimes over a second) to focus. This may not sound like a big deal, but when I wanted to take a photo at just the right moment the P510 failed me badly. It also had a hard time focusing on anything moving. Also, if you want a camera that is ready shortly after turning the power on, this this is not the camera. The power button is small and hard to press. Plus, it took so long to turn on I often pressed the power button a second time just to see if I actually turned it on, of course by doing this I would turn the camera off again. If your really into the 42x zoom feature, then realize that it comes at a price. Because the camera is relatively inexpensive the lens is not of good enough quality to work well at 1000mm (42x). I know its a bad comparison, but my D7000 with a 300mm lens has about the same magnification. I can still crop the D7000 with a 105mm lens and get better quality at the same range.  The P510 at 42x is grainy even in the best light. But, I have to say again that I was impressed with its dawn/dusk landscape capability, which makes no sense because it's not really designed to be good in that range. Video was great, but focus was an issue on anything moving around. Video was better than my D7000 minus focusing issues. Battery life was about 200-250 pics with minimal flash use. Another issue is the build quality. I have an old Coolpix 8700 and it's well built and feels solid, but the P510 feels cheap and plastic. In the end, I returned the P510 after a little over a week and 1000+ pics.""
"20120428","5.0","Nikon P 510","The latest in the Nikon line of cameras is proving to be a winner. It produces excellent images and is light weight for traveling. As an amateur photographer I am very pleased that I can take great photos and not have to tote multiple lenses on my travels.""
"20120428","5.0","Fun, Fun, Fun!!!","This is one of those wunder products.  Too many features to list them all.  The panorama feature is so easy to use it's ridiculous.  Preset scenes- one for pets that shoots three pix in a row to capture their best moment.  Automatic, Program, Aperture or Shutter priority settings are available, too.  I have just touched on the functions since I received the device but rest assured it will do about everything you want from a point and shoot camera.  The long lens even got me a shot of a jet at flight level seven mile high with the engine nacelles glistening.  It's lighter than I thought it would be. It arrived in two days thanks to Beach Camera sending it FED-EX free of charge.  Only one thing- make sure your battery is full before attempting to upload pix to your computer or it will shut down in the middle of the operation.  Other than that it's been a pleasure.""
"20120427","5.0","Perfect until today","The camera arrived in prefect conditions. I have used it about ten times and have not have any problem. I have used the zoom to the maximum and even at this point quality is acceptable. Using a medium zoom distance they are very high quality.

"20120424","4.0","Fantastic zoom!","The zoom range on this camera is beyond belief!  It is double what my previous digital mega-zoom camera could do!  The image is sharp, the stabilization is good enough to hand hold at 1000mm, and the auto sequences are fine for almost all your needs.  That said, there are several things missing that SHOULD be on this camera.  Number one is a manual focus.  Shooting between leaves, through a fence, etc., the camera will focus on the closest object, even with the center weighted metering.  Also, it almost never will go all the way to 24mm -- stops about 28mm.  Closeup shooting is also a problem in that the camera will pass optimum focus and then refuse to focus at all until you move either in or out with the zoom.  Second, I miss having a PC outlet for external flash.  The built-in flash is good for about 10 feet indoors, and is worthless outdoors as a fill flash.  Lastly, the charger that comes with the camera requires you to charge the battery INSIDE the camera!  That is both inconvenient and (to me) dangerous!  I immediately purchased additional batteries and a self contained rapid charger.""
"20120423","5.0","best zoom point and shoot camera","Love this camera!  Fast response zoom.  A bit sensitive and shaky when taking live shots during the day, but clarity is awesome.A bit of noise at 300 mm.""
"20120422","4.0","Got it for the focal length","I have been shooting  Nikon cameras and lenses  for 45 years. I obtained my first D-SLR five years ago.  I am mostly a nature and scenic photographer. I've been looking for a reasonable substitute for a $10,000 2.8 on a $3,000 D800.  A professional nature photographer suggested I give this a look.  While it certainly id not as sharp as a 1000mm 2.8 on a D4, 300 or the new 800, for the price, it is remarkably close.  I was most amazed at it's low light capabilities.  Image and color qualities are better than I expected.I read the single star review, and I suppose you can get a bad apple even with the best of quality controls, but I have found none of his problems.  Battery life --- I am amazed how long it lasts. Of course, being an 'old timer' I use the view finder.  I know of no professional or serious amateur that uses the preview screen for generall composiyin and framing, but I do like the ability to use it in flip up mode while on a tripod for ground level shooting versus getting down on my old knees.  My only disappointment battery wise, it that it has to be charged 'on board'.  The camera did not come with a stand alone charger, but there are plenty of after market chargers with batteries on line for under $20.  Macro:  There is a macro setting.  You can take close up, but it takes practice to get it to focus correctly.  I will still use my D-SLR for macro-work. I do a lot of close up photography. The P510 is not the best choice if you do to.The GPS. It works, but you have to be patient.  I takes several minutes to lock on.  Don't worry about any of the articles that scare you with privacy concerns .... It will not record in your home.  Even heavy canopy (trees) block it.  But, to record where you took remote location pictures from a days hike into the wilderness, it is a neat feature.Wide angle. For a point and shoot, it is reasonably wide.  I prefer my 10 to 20mm on my D-SLR.Telephoto:  This is where it shines.  The image stabilization is a plus and you will take many good hand-held at the maximum zoom, but if you want excellent sharpness, use a tripod.  Resolution does drop off if your subject is over 150 feet away. Up to that, you can still see individual hairs on a squirrel in sharp focus and the  individual tines of a bird feather.  As you get beyond that, this fine detail pushes the pixels, and is why folks who can afford to do so, buy $6,000 + lens. But, for a $430 camera,  you will great enlargements.What it does not have and needs:  I do wish it had an remote shutter release ... both wired and infrared.  It is hard even on a tripod to get perfectly stable camera while pressing the one and only shutter release.""
"20120422","5.0","Great All Around Camera for the Price","First of all, I have to say that I bought the red camera, and I love the color!  I researched DSLR's and other similar ultra zoom cameras, and I am happy with my choice of the Nikon P510.  It is fairly easy to operate, and I've been practicing taking a lot of indoor/outdoor/flash/close-up and low-light photos.  I have not tried the GPS yet, so I can't rate that.  I will say, however, that the battery does not hold a long charge.  That being said, I ordered the kit including 2 extra batteries, AC/DC charge, screen protector, and cleaning cloth for $19.95.  I bought a small Lowepro bag that is convenient for travel.  The viewfinder is OK.  It is nice to have the option of using one, but I generally take photos from the LCD screen.  And what can I say about the zoom?  It's awesome!I think that for the price, you are getting a lot of camera....no need to lug around extra lenses and a large bag to carry your equipment.  It is convenient and will provide excellent photos with many options.Buy it!""
"20120422","5.0","This is an amazing camera!","I really like this camera!  I purchased it as a replacement for a Panasonic FZ-18 camera that I also loved, but the FZ18 is now a little out of date.  Yes, I would have preferred a more expensive camera, but I only spent #429 dollars for the P510.I have been taking pictures of song birds, from inside a glassed in sun room hand held at 42X zoom, effectively with a 1000 mm lens.  I recently took a wonderful picture of a male Bluebird looking out the door of a birdhouse which is 75 feet away and on the other side of the thermal pane windows. Yes, I did initially have a few problems focusing at 42X zoom.  But then I found that the camera has 4 different focus setting; 'Auto', 'Auto-Macro', 'Auto-Distance', and 'Manual' (my names for the modes not their names).  Now with 'Auto-Distance' focus mode I only occasionally have focus problems when there is a lot of glare on the dirty double pane windows.  Frankly, it is ridiculous to attempt to take pictures through a dirty double pane window hand held at 42X, but this camera has amazed me. And the pictures are even better without the thermal windows.I have not experienced any short batter life problem, but I have not enabled the GPS or internet or video options so maybe those would use a lot of power.  But after reading some of the other reviews I purchased an external charger and a couple of spare batteries for $20.The 400+ page CD instruction manual means that it will take a while to learn all the options and adjustments but it is well worth doing some reading.""
"20120416","5.0","This Nikon P510 puts my D80 with my 20-300mm lense to shame!!","Great camera. I just took photos of my kid's concert and I never could get close enough to take pictures like these. The digital zoom is outstanding and had no problem zooming in to view my child from a far distance away. Video mode also worked well from a distance. This camera is well worth its price. I paid over $2000.00 for my D80 and sigma lens a few years ago. Nikon's got a real winner of a product on its hands. I hope the quality of this camera is like my D80 which is top notch. For me to get the same zoom, I would have to spend a few thousand on a new lens for my D80 and then switch the lens (pain in the rear when traveling or on the go which is usually the case for me) in order to get close to the P510's 42x optical and digital zoom. Outstanding overall.""

"20120416","4.0","Very Nice Camera!","I bought both the Nikon p510 camera and the Sony hx200v camera to see which I prefer.  I took numerous pictures with both, but decided to keep the Nikon p510.  Although both cameras took very nice pictures, I liked the way that people shots came out with the Nikon p510, especially indoors.  The Nikon p510 seems to give a nice 'matte' finish to skin shots and with a bit more color, whereas the Sony hx200v showed/emphasized more skin flaws.  Also, indoor pics with the Sony were inconsistent - sometimes too yellow, and other times too white (overexposed).  Although the Sony hx200v does have a 'soft skin' setting, I felt it looked too unnatural (gave the skin too much of a porcelain doll finish).  Also, the Nikon p510 seems to handle indoor pics better where there is a lot of backlight.  Outdoor pics are nice with both cameras, but again I preferred the people pics with the Nikon p510 (the outdoor people pics taken with the Sony were more neutral toned).  The only reason I give this review 4 stars is because the zoom can be a bit flaky when trying to focus with maximum zoom, in particular on small objects such as birds; sometimes it would focus right away, but a lot of times I had to keep adjusting the zoom before it decided to focus.  Yet, I haven't had this problem with other types of pictures.4/22/12 update:  I think I found the solution to the problem I had with zooming on small objects.  Pg 72 of the disc manual ('Using Focus Modes') talks about how to change focus modes.  It seems that when I change the focus to 'infinity', it focuses on the subject a lot quicker.  I'm still going to play with this setting a bit more, but so far it seems to have helped.  Also, after reading page 73 ('Available Focus Modes'), it looks like 'manual focus' may also be helpful on zooming in on small objects.  I will play with these settings for a while.  If I find these settings consistently work, I will change my rating to 5 stars.""

"20120407","1.0","Disappointing Compromise Camera","This camera has been a huge disappointment.  I already had a digital Pentax SLR, but the old lenses I'd originally bought for a film camera body that died when a wave hit me in Antarctica didn't have any decent wide-angle settings.  I also already had an old, good, small Olympus point-and-shoot camera with a pretty good optical zoom.  I thought this would be a good compromise camera that wouldn't excel as much as either of them, but would do a better all-around job.  Boy, was I wrong -- it isn't even as good a camera as my phone is.  Zooming in tight invariably gets me blurry pictures, even using a tripod.  (There's no bulb feature, and MAYBE there is a delay feature -- if only the manual's instruction to 'see page 39' were not a reference to a non-existent page in the paper manual.)  It quite often won't focus at all, and therefore won't take any picture AT ALL.  There's no macro setting, so very up-close pictures are also blurry and lousy.  The optics are terrible -- point this thing at a perfectly beautiful full moon, and the viewfinder will show it surrounded by a huge fuzzy halo that isn't visible with the naked eye, which was the biggest and most surprising disappointment of all, given the reputation of Nikon lenses.  Piece of junk, I'm sorry to say.""

And some other reviews voiced concerns about the length of battery life but I've taken ALOT OF PICS on a single charge and at two different occasions (I had forgotten to charge the camera in between events). And the video feature is really good considering it's not 'video camera', I have a small pocket sized Nikon point and shoot which is a great camera too but I've been using this one 100% of the time now because I'm just so amazed at the job it does!!!!!! It's totally worth the price, anybody looking at this camera and who is on the fence about buying it stop thinking and do it your gonna love it!!!!!!!! And go for the red it's BEAUTIFUL., if I could rate it better then 5 stars I would that's how impressed I am.

"20120327","4.0","Finally It's HERE!","Let me start by saying I have been waiting for this camera since early February. And waiting and waiting long after it was supposed to be released February 15th. Today I finally got mine! (obviously only having it for a few hours won't allow me to give the best review but I would like to point out some of the things I have noticed) I am an avid camera collector and Nikon fan, taking classes in high school and college (and the last thing I needed was yet another camera) but I was unhappy with my options. My DSLR took fantastic pictures but was too heavy to carry around for everyday use and my basic point and shoot was the perfect pocket size, but took less than decent pictures. I was hoping a bridge camera would solve all of my problems.Pros so far:- Camera powers on very quickly.- Its surprisingly light and compact without sacrificing amazing picture quality.- The camera body has a nice grip on it so it's easy to hold on to and stays in your hand.- The pop out screen makes it oh so easy to see pictures you're taking at weird angles.- Easy to use (especially for those people who aren't comfortable with adjusting ISO and shutter speed manually - but can be adjusted for those who are)- Has tons of settings (hard to say forsure but seems like it performs well in low light situations)- The zoom is INCREDIBLE (I can take a picture of a lego mini figure from 20 feet away with better clarity and image quality than I could right in front of the object with my point and shoot)The downsides I have noticed so far:-Video is alright, when I blow it up on my computer it doesn't look to be true HD quality but it's good. Also the zoom on the video can be heard no matter what which is a little annoying.-The zoom on the actual camera is very slow if you're extending it the full range and it takes a few seconds to focus.- Battery life is not that good - would definitely recommend getting a back up!Overall I LOVE this camera. Sure you may find a Canon or Olympus that has slightly better reviews in one feature or another, but let's be real, no camera has it all. However, in my opinion so far this comes pretty close!""
"20120325","3.0","Nice Pictures, Poor Video","I have had the Nikon P510 for a week now and have been comparing it to a Panasonic FZ150 that I am also testing.The P510 is a very nice looking camera that has a quality look and feel.  It has a nice textured rubberized material on the hand grip and it has a solid feel.The camera powers on quickly.  I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and I was happy with the results.  The shot to shot speed is slower than the FZ150 and overall it does not feel as fast or snappy as the FZ150 in everyday use.The 42X zoom is incredible but it was slow to focus, or would not focus at all sometimes with the zoom at it's outer reaches.Overall I slightly preferred the picture quality on the FZ150 and had more keepers with the FZ150 due to its faster and more accurate auto focus.  But if I wasn't doing a side by side comparison I would be happy with the picture quality on the Nikon.The biggest problem I have with the P510 is it's video performance.  The actual video image quality is excellent.  In fact the low light video quality is impressive and considerably better than the FZ150.  There are, however, three big problems.1)Inability to focus at extended zoom range.  After you zoom about two thirds of the range it is unable to auto focus.  So while it has an incredible 42X zoom, it is not usable with video.  And it's not like you know when it will loose focus so you just end up with a video scene that suddenly turns blurry as you zoom.2)It refocuses every time you touch the zoom control.  Even if you just slightly zoom, the camera looses focus for about one second before locking in again.  You end up with a video clip that has multiple one second blurry segments intermixed within an otherwise clear video.3)The sound of the lens zooming is picked up while recording.  This is not just heard during very quiet scenes, it is heard all the time.  I was surprised how loud it was when playing back a video.If video performance is not important to you, the Nikon is a really nice camera.  I am looking for a camera does well at both photos and video and therefore will be returning this camera.""
"20120325","5.0","Excellent Features, low price","I was looking for a bridge camera from quite sometime and this fits my choice because of lots of features and price. I got this from Best Buy today morning and have tried few Auto and PASM features. The look and feel is like a DSLR. This has a long list of features. The 42x Zoom holds good if you use your other hand to hold the lens and use viewfinder. I tried few indoor and outdoor pictures and am pleased with the quality. For the feature list i feel the price is good. The battery came fully charged and with little use it still holds good power. I have uploaded 2 pics - one with A - large aperture and 1 in Auto Zoom mode. I am not a pro photographer and do not have a bridge or DSLR camera thus cannot compare the images but I am a avid photographer and certainly like the quality of the image. This does not have horse shoe or RAW but I can live without that. I have not checked video options, high and slow motion video or panorama or 3D yet thus not commenting on that. Overall I am happy with my purchase.update : 3rd April 2012I have been taking lot of pics with this camera on my current trip to Vegas and Grand Canyon. The Auto mode is excellent. I ordered a pack of 2 batteries from overstock. I received a 1500 mH power battery and not the 1100 that comes with the camera. I have occasionally used the screen else most of the time used view finder. On a full charge I have clicked 424 pictures and short 1 min 4 videos. the charge has stayed pretty good if viewfinder is used.Video - quality is good even with zoom .. the problem is focus ... i need to find an option to disable auto focus. if the camera can do that then the video come out very well.

Image quality on the Canon SX40 HS is better, the P510 may be in the same league as the Panasonic FZ150 though.Battery life is the weakest point here, the battery is half the size of SX40's and FZ150's.The strongest point is the LCD, with a 900k resolution, it's much better than Canon's 200k and Panasonics's 400k. Though the LCD can't be flipped to face you when you're taking pictures of yourself.Also the zoom is a very strong point, it's much more than what you get with the FZ150, but it's comparable really to what the SX40 has to offer.Overall, this camera is very fun to use, and it's weakest points are bareable and are most regarding to battery life. My advice is to get a spare battery with it and you're good to go.""
