"20120601","5.0","SIMPLY THE BEST","I've been in the hobby for 60+ years and upgraded from a Canon S3.The G12 seems to be the culmination of all Canon's photo technology.Viewfinder,right size and built like a brick.Checked Nikon's 7000 and was turned off by negative reviews & customer service.Now, if I can just figure how to turn it on ?""
"20120531","4.0","Wonderful camera shy of DSLR","I wanted to upgrade from my Canon SD1100. I asked my photography friends about recommendations for cameras and one of them suggested that I look at the Canon G12. I know nothing about the ISO, shutter speeds, aperture, etc. so I thought buying a DSLR may be too much money and too high of a learning curve. My needs were to be able to take close up pictures of flowers with blurry background, better action shots of my kids' sports, better nighttime photography, better low light pictures, and so on. I am able to achieve all my photography needs with the G12. It is smaller than a DSLR so you can fit it in a purse or small bag. I love the swivel screen. It does come in very handy. The SCENERY modes are very useful. In fact, my favorite is Color Accent since you can pick a color in a picture, such as red, and the rest of the picture is in black and white. You can do the same thing in Photoshop, but it's very handy to be able to do the processing while you take the picture. The pictures turn out very artsy. The depth of field with this camera is a bit limited when trying to take close ups and you want to blur the background. My photography friend gave me this tip. He told me to shoot in Aperture Priority mode (Av). At the same time, use Zoom to zoom in on your subject. Change the f stop to the smallest setting possible with zoom enabled. Step back more from the subject and zoom in more. Take the picture. Voila! The blurry background is achieved! The Portrait setting in the SCENERY mode supposedly blurs the background, but not enough for me. I'm going to take a local photography class to understand more about basic photography concepts, but I'm sure I will be able to take even more awesome pictures with the Canon G12 after that. Take a look on flickr.com and search for Canon G12. You'll see so many pictures taken with this camera. This camera can take amazing pictures with the proper understanding of how to use its functions.""
"20120530","4.0","Quality you expect","I had the G9 and now the G12.  Noticeable improvements function has been made.  The only issue I have is the controls.  There are a lot of controls in a small space which clutters finger placement when holding.  They are also a bit flimsy feeling but so far nothing has broken.  Not going into the technical aspects of the camera because it is well known brand and line.  This camera is a clear step up for the average point and shoot photographer and is easy to use with ample settings.  I do like the shortcut button for most used setting.  The HD video/sound feature is very clear and picks up even the slightest sounds.  The G series is a quality product that I recommend to any skill level.  Enjoy.""
"20120524","5.0","Great camera","This is a fabulous camera for the money.  I have had several DSLRs and compacts, including Nikon, Olympus, Canon and Sony over the years, and this is by far the best of the bunch.  Very powerful and versatile, but even on auto or semi-auto takes lovely pictures, deep colors and crisp focus.  Highly recommended for those who want a bit more than point and shoot but don't really want to brave the choppy seas of full DSLRs and heavy lenses etc etc.""
"20120521","4.0","Excellent camera","I have really enjoyed my initial experience with this camera. I've been using it for several weeks now and I love the image quality and control this camera provides. The many physical knobs and buttons give me great ability to customize the camera for my usage. It's so much faster being able to turn a knob to adjust the ISO or exposure compensation than going through a bunch of menus. Picture and video quality are both very good and noise up through ISO 400 is very good and even at 800 is still acceptable in most cases. The close focus distance is very good. Focus is usually very good although I have run into cases where it has trouble. I really wanted an optical viewfinder but have been disappointed in this one. I can deal with the reduced field of view but the inaccurate center and lack of any viewfinder info is frustrating.All in all I love using the camera and am looking forward to learning how to use it more effectively and expect to get some excellent photos out of it. I'm hoping to pick up a Canon 270EX flash to give more flash distance and bounce capability.""
"20120519","2.0","Flawed design scratches the lense","I have a G10 and, like many other G10 owners, the lense is scratched due to the design flaw in the closing mechanism. The G12 has the same problem as evidenced by the many comments you can find on the web. Canon has an insulting 'loyalty' program where they will trade my  defective G10 for a REFURBISHED  G12 for $350!! A new one costs $399 here on Amazon! I paid close to $500 for the G10 and it lasted about 2 years. I'm used to cameras lasting a lot longer than this. It was a great camera but I would not replace it with the same thing because there is a high probability that it would happen again. With so many excellent alternatives, I'm very surprised Canon's 'loyalty' program is actually a way to make more $$. Sell a defective camera and profit from the trades.""

"20120419","5.0","One of the best compact camera","Canon G series is a top-list compact camera. I also use Canon 500D with some lens and accessories. As DSLR user, carrying such heavy tools becomes burdensome especially hiking trips. G12 allows user to manually operate functions as we can do it on DSLR. The depth of field is not very deep comparing to DSLR but the color is so vivid. It also comes with high capacity battery that is very lasting comparing to other compact cameras. I firstly made decision to buy it because I needed a 130ft underwater housing (500D housing is 2x of the camera's price!). The quality underwater is also brilliant. I find G12 is the best just second to DSLR. Now I have both 500D and G12 in which I pick 500D for easy to moderate trip and G12 for hard or scuba trip.The only thing that I find it lacks is that there should be underwater flash housing available. Now I'm looking for 3rd party to attach with when I go scuba.""
"20120418","5.0","Great travel/learning camera","I received the canon g12 as a christmas present after cycling through many entry level point and shoots. I have been becoming more interested in photography over the past couple of years and was looking for a good enthusiast camera to learn off of. I had done extensive research before purchasing and could not be happier with the g12.When researching i quickly ruled our mirrorless cameras or dslrs as I did not feel as if I knew enough to invest in a system yet. I also wanted something relatively compact that I can take on vacations.  That narrowed my choices down to the g12, the nikon p7100 or the canon s100.I decided on the g12 because:1) it has much longer battery life than the more compact s100. I thought this extremely important when out on vacation as I have heard how quickly the s100 drained the battery. The g12 is a bigger camera, but not if you need 4 extra batteries to make it through the day.2) it has a hotshoe vs the s100.3) the g12 seemed to have slightly better reviews than the p7100 and I believe the g series has been around much longer than nikons so it was a more developed camera with less bugsAfter I bought it the g 1x was released, but I still feel that I  am glad I have the g12 because it seems that it is more rounded it its abilities ( ie macro) and also hundreds of dollars cheaper. I bought a g12, a canon speedlight e270ii, gorillapod  and a lowe pro bag and still had 200+ dollars left over.The g12 has virtually every control that a dslr has in a relatively compact body. My knowledge of photography has increased exponentially over the last few months. I would highly recommend this camera to enhusaists or people looking to develop their skills.Ps- i have some sample pics here at flickr if you want to see what real world pics look like[...]""
"20120417","3.0","good camera but scratches its own lens","I like this camera. I use it all the time. I've had mine a year, and would recommend it.But... and a big but ... I was surprised when it was still quite new to see a significant scratch on the lens near the mid-point. How did that happen? I'm careful with my cameras. Never dropped it, always set it down with care. But there it was, a nasty scratch that caught the light in some situations and degraded the image. Frankly, I was embarrassed to think I had damaged my own camera.Now, months later, I have more scratches. A little cloud of scratches. I know I'm not doing this to my camera.I have come to believe that the metal curtains that open and close when I turn the camera on and off are doing the nasty deed. I don't think they're bent. I just think they're too close. A speck of dust on the lens can get dragged across the glass, resulting in a scratch.I will try to get an answer from Canon. But I see on photo forums that this is a common complaint. I believe it's a design flaw, and a serious one.It should be a note of caution for anyone considering this camera.""

I'm disappointed the camera did not come with a user's manual so I have to purchase David Busch's guide to digital photography for canon powershot G12. I'm just beginning to learn how to use the camera and by the first few pictures I'm able to take on auto mode, the pictures are perfect in sharpness, color and details that I'm giving this camera a five star for now.

It's small, handy and it has all the features of EOS series of course without a mirror :)Great camera for every day use, worth money if you already have Canon flash.Comparing to G11 the body is much more ergonomically designed - a big plus for Canon!10Mpx is more then enough, LCD screen is great! Of course, AF could be faster but it not a big issue, it's not designed for fast shooting :)""
"20110911","4.0","Camera for Underwater Photography","The Powershot G12 was recommended by a professional underwater photographer for it's ease of use. I got it for underwater photography (scuba diving), but I haven't used it yet for that. I have used it for everyday photography, but not a lot, because I have a Canon EOS Rebel xSi, which I love. It's a nice camera. The quality of pictures is pretty good. The lens retracts and closes after a few  minutes when you are not actively using it (scrolling through pictures you've taken). I like being able to see on the display screen what I am focusing on. My Canon xSi doesn't have that. It's heavy for its size, but for me, that means it's not made of cheap plastic. I can only rate this camera based on its limited use. I will update the review after I use it for diving. Cost of camera- $469.00.""

"20110903","5.0","Canon's G12 beats all DSLRs in this "ASPECT"","I bought the G12 mainly because it was highly recommended here on the Amazon reviews.  Several people commented that this is a tough, solid, dependable camera, and I wanted something built better than our Nikon S8100, which had lens error after six months and had to be sent back to Nikon for warranty repair, but that is another story.I'm not a Canon 'fanboy' - we had only Nikons and Canons in the last 30 years and I like them equally.The G12 has been praised here like few others, and I won't repeat what the reviewers stated so well, because they are all right. But I'd like to add something which has been left out, and this is the main reason I'd rather use the G12  than our DSLR.The 16:9 aspect ratio.Most new TV sets and monitors have the wide mode or 16:9 aspect ratio or the 1920 x1080 resolution.  What this means is that when I view photos taken by the DSLR on our 27 inch monitor,  I'm only looking at a 23 inch picture.  The rest of the screen is taken up by gray bars on the sides.No big deal, you say.  Just hit the plus key two or three times, and voila, there is  a photo covering the entire screen.That is true, but by now I'm looking at  a different photo, I lost something in the foreground by cropping.For the life of me I can't understand that a $ 99 point of shoot will support 16:9 4:3  3:2 and 1:1 aspect ratios, but a $ 3,000 DSLR does not.  Some of the Sonys do, but I'm not familiar with them.  The Canon D60 and the T3i  support the 16:9 aspect ratio, BUT ONLY WHILE USING LIVE VIEW.  Live view is using the screen, and I much prefer the clarity and ease of composing on the optical viewfinder.The G12 supports 16:9, and it doesn't matter if I'm using the viewfinder or the screen.If anyone else gets frustrated by this, please, I'd love to hear your comments.  There might be some photo program which is able to convert DSLR photos easily into the 16:9 aspect ratio, but I'm not aware of it.  If you found one, please let us know.""
"20110829","5.0","Built in ND filter? Get outta here! UPDATE 1-13-2012","Canon really goes all-out to give you a one-gadget solution for most shots with their g-series cameras. What I'd really like to see is this exact camera but with the APS-C sensor found on the Sony compact interchangeable lens cameras.Combine an APS-C sensor with the feature set found here, which already produces some achingly beautiful images, and you would have a camera more pros would carry in the field. The main reason they don't already is because Canon's P&S image sensor is so tiny that low light noise will always be a problem. Miniaturization has now progressed to the point where Sony can offer a smaller camera body with a crop sensor like Canon's Rebel series. But if you've used the Sonys, you already know that even with the big sensor and interchangeable lenses, the G12 still takes better pics.Can you imagine this camera, DIGIC V, its same current feature set and lens optimized for a new crop sensor with 14 MP, each 5 times the size of the pixels in this current beast? Come on, Canon, step up and give us a revolutionary G!For now this baby has some great features that are improvements over my old G10. The new 10MP sensor is a tangible improvement compared to the overpixillated 14MP marketing ploy that beset the old machine. Video is better, everything happens a bit faster. Smaller files write quicker. The articulated display is a major step forward. HDR mode is largely a gimmick--you can get a pretty good 3 shot 'Canon bracket' with the G12 in RAW that processes nicely in Photomatix for a much smoother HDR experience than you can get in any onboard processing. And with the dedicated exposure compensation thumbwheel and a tripod, you can take your own bracket on top of what the camera does automatically, and get as many shots in your composite as you feel you need.For regular daylight shooting, the built-in ND filter is perhaps my favorite feature of this camera. To my knowledge no other P&S has it. It gives you several stops worth of ND filtering, allowing you to push your histogram much farther to the right in bright conditions, catching much more foreground detail without burning out the highlights. I use the Lensmate trumpet adapter for a graduated filter to enhance this feature even more. I carried them over from the G10 and they work perfectly with the G12 as well. You can get astounding daylight shots with this camera with just a neutral graduated filter and its own lens features.I keep the adapter and filters in my car--most of the time they are easily gettable when the light gets good as long as I didn't forget to bring the camera! I love this thing for my kind of picture taking. It's not as good for sports and action photography. It's awesome for product shots, landscape, architecture (usable wide angle) and makes far better indoor shots than the old G10. Also takes quite good group portraits in a pinch. But if I know the family's all going to be together, then I lug out the T2i with the 50mm 1.4 prime. I'd rather have a full frame setup with the 1.2 L 50mm for less of a telephoto effect and better performance, but what I have gets wide enough.If I need a wider angle lens, I just pull out the G12. In daylight conditions, the photos I get from this camera are easily as pretty to look at as what comes out of that much larger T2i. The main thing you need to do is fool around a LOT, find out what light does to your images and how to make your camera take advantage of the light, and use good compositional sense while you do it. You're bound to have some images turn out right; even more so with the G12. I get more good shots with this camera than I do with my big rig because it's actually with me when the photo op arrives.If you like making photographs and want a P&S that will give you ACRES of room to grow in your ability, this machine will constantly surprise you. If you are an SLR shooter tired of lugging the monster around and worrying about thousands of dollars in glass instead of playing with your friends and family, the G12 will help you make a large portion of the images you're used to while letting you have a good time. Great vacation or spur-of-the-moment camera. If you are considering a Rebel XS or XSi as your main camera, DROP THE CHALUPA. You will be far happier with this. Until you can step up to the next level of sensors, all that money you'll have in glass is sort of half wasted on the low-end SLRs. If you're planning to get a better camera at some point, then sure, the XSi will do in a pinch. But to equal the performance of the lens on the G12 you'll have to spend a pretty penny on aftermarket glass. The lens on this thing is really good.So Canon, if you really want to get my attention, drop the crop sensor from the T2i into this camera! I know, I know, it would require a complete lens redesign and cost a couple hundred more.IT WOULD ALSO BE WORTH IT. Give me that camera!UPDATE 1-12-2012:Wow, Canon read my review before I wrote it and updated the G12 to the G1x, with a beautiful 14.1 MP sensor of nearly APS-C size. We're taking over six times the real estate of the G12/S95 sensor for truly massive increases in pixel size, light sensitivity and color selectivity. The increased refraction angles inherent in the large surface area sensor mean that soft backgrounds are going to be a specialty of this camera. The new sensor also means that the f/2.8 lens speed goes from 'good enough' to 'really good.' Because the MASSIVELY increased size of the individual pixels means that low light performance will be significantly enhanced. I'm putting my G12 on the market TODAY. Perhaps my S95 as well if I need the scratch to pay for this thing, though I'd rather hang onto the minicam.I was pretty sure the G12 would be the last in the G series--because my S95 does almost everything the G12 can do. But THIS? This is game on. It totally redefines the G series. Yes, it is a couple hundred more as I predicted. Did I also say it would be worth it? Up until now the players in the large sensor fixed lens field were the Fuji X100 at $1400 and a &2000 Leica. To me $799 is a stretch of the budget. You really have to commit at the prices of the G1 X's competition.Its true competition is the mirrorless interchangeable-lens category from Sony, Olympus and Panasonic. People rapidly find with those cameras they're still carrying a bag of accessories around like their old SLR but their pics aren't as nice, lens and flash selection is sparse and they prefer a Canon or Nikon SLR. Canon has decided to compete against that market by offering a compromise of better compact convenience, image quality and simplicity against multiple lens flexibility. I think the G1 X will win a significant portion of potential mirrorless slr customers.Looks like it will ship around April. My preorder is in, so I have that amount of time to get my low-exposure-count G12 to a new owner. I'm sure that person will be thrilled with the G12, truly one of the best in its price class. If I were looking in the $400 price range the G12 is my camera. Yes, the G1 X is twice that, and there are DSLRs with bigger sensors and more capabilities for equal money. But I have one of those, a T2i. It's a great camera. But when I'm carrying it, I have to carry a big bag around. That's why I own the G12, and that's why I will own its successor. The G12 has so much instant tactile control and functions very similarly to the T2i. It is a fabulous travel camera that attracts far less attention than a DSLR. No, you don't get super zoom capability and super shallow depth of field for arty shots. But the G12 is so competent at getting the shot I'm going for that most of the time I don't need any more camera. Going for the G1 X to retain the basic G12 form factor and extend the capability. At their respective price points both the G12 and the G1 X are significantly ahead of the pack. I love that Canon is pushing the envelope in this specialized class.Canon, the G12 is a MAGNIFICENT camera, and the G1 X promises to push the G series to legendary status. I am very excited the company chose to move in this direction. This machine has the potential to best the X100 at just over half the price.THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!""

I wanted a small, light weight point and shoot to have with me when I don't want to carry around my big SLR. I tested the G12 against the Lumix LX5. Although the Lumix had slightly better image quality the rest of the G12 won out. The swivel LED, the quickness of changing controls, built-in viewfinder, and most of all the longer telephoto aspect of the lens were the deciding factors. I wish that both cameras had an image quality that would allow me to make very large prints but if I keep them at about 14 inches the pictures look great. I have made enlargements up to 3 feet but had to reduce noise first in Photoshop.  Nevertheless, for ease of use and tons of options I definitely recommend the G12. There is very slight fringing in high contrast areas but the image is sharp from side to side. The smallest aperture is F8 but that is the same with the Lumix. As a conclusion, I am happy with this camera.""

Although it can be used in automatic mode, it is too expensive for that alone.  However, an interested person, willing to spend time learning how to use its features, will be rewarded.Canon provides a manual on  DVD, but it is cumbersome.  You cannot always have a computer on hand. They should also provide a printed copy.Many functions/adjustments are available by buttons and dials on the outside of the camera, so you don't always  have to go to menus in the camera.  That's a help, but small fingers are an asset.""

From what I can tell, the camera takes great shots and offers a number of both useful and fun 'scene' effects.  Quality is good, but noticed as soon as I started using it that I don't like the cover on the LCD screen.  It is awkward how it opens and protrudes out, as if it doesn't belong.  It interferes with quick shots, because it takes an extra second or two to simply open the LCD screen cover.  I bought it in haste, since my Powershot G9 had died, and I was leaving for Barbados in a couple of days.  Since I absolutely loved my G9, I assumed (without fully researching G12) that it would be even better.  I need more time to play with its features and learn how to use it without the LCD screen.  That is the only negative I have observed.  Otherwise a nice camera.""

I used to take one second hand held shots with my M3 with good results.  I was really into existing light photography there for awhile.  My powershot A720 didn't do to well in low light situations.  I read about how good the Canon G12 was for low light shots.  IT IS!  In fact, when set on AUTO, the flash hardly ever goes off.  It simply adjust itself for a high ISO and takes the picture.  WOW!  No brains required.  Love the camera, and yes, I also like the feel of it.  Someone had put down the rough finish etc etc.  But I really like it.  I could have bought a bigger, heavier digital SLR, but it wouldn't fit in my jacket pocket like the G12 does.  Ya, it's bigger then the old Powershot, but it will fit.

Ohh, and that swivel monitor is a nice option for those candid photos where the subject  might be intimidated by a larger DSLR, or for those funky angles that DSLRs have trouble with. While it is true that it's not as great in low light situations as compared to a good DSLR, it's better than average for a P&S. My only complaint isn't so much aimed at the G-12 as much as it is at most P&S cameras, especially the high end P&S like the G-12. My complaint; well, I wish that the focal length started at 18mm instead of the standard 28mm. Past that, the G-12 is a great camera to have when you don't want to tote around the larger DSLR and the assorted lenses.""

The selection indicator light actually shuts off in a couple of places when you're in automatic mode as a reminder that the control isn't active.  I ordered a remote control from china for $15 which supposed works from 100 yards, just to complete package.  It has a mini hdmi connector too so that you can plug it into your TV.  It has a bunch of automatic preview modes which you can choose (including 'off').  I chose the blur preview which shows the original picture in one window and a zoom in of a portion of the image so you can check the focus.  It's a nice and geeky camera with all the controls, but you can also reasonably store in a big pocket it you don't want to flaunt it.  The LCD also folds in backwards if you want to protect it, and it can be turned in different angles in case you want to take a shot from over your head or a self-portrait if you're that damn sexy.  I got really lucky that I found it for $100 off one day, but that might not happen again.""
"20110718","5.0","Unbelievable Pictures","After much research, I finally decided to buy this camera.  I am completely delighted with everything about it. As a amateur photographer,  I was concerned this camera may be too advanced for my expertise level, however, my concerns immediately vanished after a short time of playing with the settings, reading the manual and of course taking pictures.  This camera is certainly something I can grow into as I learn more about the advanced settings.For now, I've been using the 'auto' and 'P' modes. The menu settings within these modes are intuitive and easy to navigate.The picture quality is amazingly clear and crisp and the color is superb as well. I have had several comments already about the picture quality.  The camera is small enough that I can easily take it with me where ever I travel.  The battery life is very good, and, the battery completely charged in 2 1/2 hours.  I've taken 100's of pictures without any sign of battery power loss.I would buy this camera again and I highly receommend this item to anyone looking for a camera that provides SLR type picture quality in a non - SLR camera.The only negative thing I can say about the G12 is that it would have been nice to have a better optical zoom.  Having said that, I have taken pictures at full optical zoom and then cropped them.  The pictures were still very crisp after cropping them.""
"20110717","5.0","Great camera on the go","I have been looking to buy a 5D Mark II for a quite a while now.  However, I recently found out that I would be deploying for a year overseas and I didn't want to spend money on a camera that would be too big and bulky to take with me.  I swore I would never buy anything but a total compact for quick shots and an uncomprimising DSLR for more deliberate settings, but I ended up making an exception and buying the G12.  I couldn't be happier.The G12 provides plenty of manual controls and acceptable low-light ability in a package small enough to fit in a pouch on my flak jacket where it is accessible all the time.  Additionally, it is built rock solid - I dropped it while getting on a helicopter the other day and it fell 4 or 5 feet, landing on solid rock - not even a scratch.  It is also nice that the screen can be flipped around, so it does not have to be exposed all the time, preventing excessive scratches.  It goes from in your pocket to ready to shoot in just a few seconds with a very short boot-up time, and the shoot settings wheel on the top makes for easy changes without having to navigate through electronic menus - a plus when you are walking or bouncing up and down in a vehicle or helicopter. Some of the complaints in other reviews are valid:1.  I've always been a fan of an optical viewfinder, and when I bought this camera I planned to keep the screen tucked away for protection, exclusively using the viewfinder.  However, I found that the viewfinder does not provide an accurate representation of the size of the frame, and the result was lots of cropping later - I have since started using the screen to compose my shots with much better results.  It could probably go away without breaking my heart, but I do like having it there as an option.2.  I am typically wearing thick leather gloves while shooting, so a larger rear control wheel and buttons would be nice.Other than these minor complaints, this camera is great, and I couldn't be happier with the quality that I have come to expect (this is my 4th Canon).  Well-rounded camera that is ideally suited for an environment that places a premium on light-weight, flexibility, ease of use, but still requires a decent lens and a degree of manual control.  A great choice for anyone not able to carry around a DSLR all the time.""
"20110715","5.0","Beautiful pictures","I have not had the camera long and am still wading through the online manual.  I am a complete novice but was sick of mediocre pictures and a small zoom.  The reviews of this camera on Amazon convinced me to buy it after many months of reading about lots of other cameras. I love the feel of the Canon G12. It is solidly built but still fits well in my 78 year old hands. The one thing I had to have was a see through lens and this camera has it.  Have you ever tried to take a picture with the sun shining on the screen?  You can't see a thing. I'm working on some night time shots, experimenting with lower iso etc. This is fun.  Sorry I can't be too tecnical but I would like other novices to know that this camera is worth investing in and I'm learning as I go along. Maybe I'll write a better review in a few months.""
"20110713","5.0","G12 rocks.","Bought this camera as a backup to my SLR also canon. I tried the LX5 first and sent it back. Beautiful camera but IQ was not to my liking. I really wanted to get the S95 to save some $ but it just didn't feel right in my hand. After the sticker shock and many beautiful pics I know I made the right choice for me. I like to take landscapes with the G12 when I have a longer prime lens on the SLR so I don't have to change so much. So far I am pleased with the results.""
"20110704","5.0","Love the G12's  Retro Vibe","Since excellent reviews have already been written (plus some on You Tube), I will keep remarks brief and  personal.I am basically a film photographer--mainly 4x5.  In years past, I've taken film cameras to Europe, but now I'm too old for that.  So I wanted a high-quality digi for travel.  These were my criteria: I wanted a viewfinder.  I did not need interchangeable lenses.  I wanted one with many positive user reviews.  I did not want to spend much more than $500.It had to be small enough to fit in  my jacket pocket (no camera bag, please).  But it needed to be large enough to accommodate external wheels, knobs, and switches---similar to classic film interface.  I hate scrolling  menus and searching for settings.  So I hoped for a digital camera like my my Rollei 35!  High quality, but spare. Two cameras  fit the bill:  The Canon G12 and  the Nikon P 7000.  I did not choose the Nikon P7000 because it was a new camera, needing firmware upgrades and some body improvements  I bet it will be a fine camera in another year.So I bought a G12.  It's a very enjoyable and fun camera to use:  It brings back memories  shooting  film with my SLR  and TLR cameras  The G12  allows  me to concentrate on the subject instead of the camera.  It also has many electronic features that are easy to access and fun to use.It feels solid and well-made.  For someone like me who has enjoyed manual cameras for decades, the G12 offers an enjoyable and plausible alternative for travel.""
"20110701","5.0","Amazing little camera!","I purchased this as a back-up for my DSLR, both in case of loss or damage to my DSLR while traveling or for city use when I just didn't want to lug around a big camera.  I first purchased the Sony NEX-5, and after testing it for a couple of weeks, returned it due to its habit pf severely overexposing, poor menu design, and surprisingly poor image quality (given that it has such a large sensor).  Next I purchased and tested the Olympus PEN-EPL2, which I also returned (despite its excellent image quality) due to its poor screen brightness and lack of an optical viewfinder making it unusable in bright sunlight, and its digital zoom being so poor as to be unusable.  Finally I found the Canon G12, and I am thrilled with it.  I am amazed that they can get such fabulous image quality on a sensor that is just barely bigger than most point-and-shoot cameras (and with 'only' 10MP) but the image quality, low light performance, and ergonomics are all superb.  I love having so much control right at my fingertips without having to dig into menus, and despite having 'only' a 5X optical zoom, the digital zoom is really quite usable.  Another excellent attribute is battery life; I have shot about 800 exposures so far, and have not needed to re-charge the battery!  Build quality is excellent.  Highly recommend!""
"20110701","4.0","A Pleasure to use.","I'll not expound upon the virtues nor the shortcomings of the G12 as so many have done so already.  Howerver, there are two operational features not found in the users' manual.1.  The zoom will not operate when the just taken photo is on the screen (review).  The shutter/focus button must be depressed to interupt the view time (1 to 10 seconds) for the zoom to work for your next shot.2.  Talking to the Canon technicians, the G12 has no provisions to 'lock out' the controls, such as a cellular phone can.How it all happened:My camera settings were changing as I was shooting a classic car cruise and I was puzzled as to why.  I found later that the heel of my hand, because of the grip I normally use, was inadvertantly depressing the control buttons, changing my settings arbitrarily.  The controls cannot be set and locked.  This situation can be avoided by using the 'pinch' method of holding the camera: Put the right forefinger on top and the thumb at the bottom of the camera. I'm not about to change to this method...not after 50 years of using my normal one-handed grip.  As much as I like the G12, the Nikon P7000 much better suits my grip.""

BUT: Totally worthless for anything that moves, because the continuous drive is so slow I could paint a picture faster.  It's a shame.  With a faster continuous drive, this would be a great little camera.Another feature I find myself wanting is tethered shooting, which did existed in earlier G models.Finally, a wider aperture would be nice.

"20110623","4.0","Best since my 35mm Olympus range finder.","I've had 35mm SLR systems for 40 years. The old case used to hold two Canon Bodies, a gaggle of lenses and accessories, and in a little out the way pocket I stuck an Olympus rangefinder. Like many photographers I used the rangefinder for street photography and walk around stuff. I probably took more shots with the little guy than with the other two SLR bodies combined.So now I am DSLR all the way. Have a single EOS 7D and the same gaggle of lenses and accessories as before and in that little out of the way pocket of my case I stick a G12. The G12 fills out my system and I feel whole again. I rarely use the LCD screen and shoot like always through the rangefinder unless I want a shot than can only be accommodated by flipping the screen out for high angle shots. I enjoy this camera very much.Things I like---Very good low light imaging that is made possible by having 'only' 10MP. The sensors are larger instead. Canon knew what they were doing here.Light weightExtremely long lasting battery (but remember I hardly ever use the LCD screen).Things I don't like---No printed manualHard to use navigation ring on the back side. Way too small.No shoe coverAll and all the 140 great reviews vs that 12 negative ones gives you the right story in my mind. Since I have never tested any of the competition and cannot compare them then this heavily liked camera must do well in comparison.As for LCD display vs optical viewfinder it will depend I suppose on what you are used to. I am still not comfortable holding a camera at arms length to find the picture (I've been a photographer for half a century).With a small light weight camera that has an optical view finder, I can hold it at my side with one hand, raise it quickly to my eye, and take the shot. Great for street photography and candid shots and once you take some that way you will take most of them that way.Don't hate the optical view finder. Go to your camera store and try one out. If your salesman looks under 40 try to  find an older one. :)""
"20110622","2.0","Skin tones are as soft as a manikin","We have owned and been very fond of a Canon PowerShot G3 and G5, and just returned a G12.  We also own a Canon EOS 5D and love it, so we have nothing against Canon cameras.  The skin tones shot with a G12 make everyone look like a manikin.  It has got to be an error in the programming of the DSP, and we suppose Canon (like some broadcast video camera manufacturers) probably considers this softening of skin tones a flattering 'feature'.  If that is the case, there should be an option to TURN IT OFF!  We deeply regret not having a usable PowerShot as a walk-around camera.""
"20110612","4.0","Flip screen for the win!","Fairly happy with the image quality of my Canon ELPH but wanting more control over the picture-taking process, I set about hunting down the Next Big Thing to own, camerawise. A dSLR was tops on my list, till I priced 'em and realized I'd likely be itchin' to ditch the kit lens with no means of paying for an upgrade.I honed in on the G12 and S95, as I was familiar with the Canon line and have read much about their comparative high picture quality. Both cams had their strengths, but in the end I decided if I *must* have a highly compact cam on me, the ELPH would suffice, whereas the G12 came bundled with extra goodies vs. the S95 and isn't really all that clunky - not by a mile, compared to a dSLR.What I didn't realize is how much I would love one of those goodies - the flip ('articulating') screen. The screen immediately coaxed me to consider shot angles I might not otherwise have contemplated. Plus, I found myself preferring to hold the G12 at waist level with me looking down at the upturned screen, like an old-fashioned camera with the viewfinder on the top. If you like the idea of a flip screen but haven't played around with one for still shots, I highly recommend the experience.Strengths (for me):* Screen (duh) (even if it's not the highest-res one out there).* The front-mounted toggle to the right of the lens - pure inspiration, and the go-to component in full-on manual mode (the only mode I really use) to control shutter speed/exposure.* The very friendly, old-school film-speed wheel atop the cam body.* RAW image option. (Albeit, a complete space hog, both on the memory card and on my hard drive - I've had to purchase a second drive to keep up with my output.)* Wicked nice shots, or (for me) at least wicked nice raw material to massage in Photoshop (I can't leave stuff alone, that way).Weaknesses:* Truly hate that the manual focus is controlled by the little menu flywheel on the back. Because the wheel responds to press commands as well as turn commands, I'm constantly pressing a shot mode by mistake when trying to fine tune the focus, plus the small wheel doesn't allow for the sort of gradual adjustment you can get with a lens ring.* Limited f-stops (2.8 - 8.0). But this is just my experience with my old SLR talkin'; if there's a wider range available at this price point, I haven't learned about it. Nevertheless, I haven't had issues with clarity through the field depth at 8.0, at least at the limited sizes I print at (no poster sizes for me at this point).* Lack of optical zoom beyond 5X. This actually may be a deal breaker for me. You see, I'm a control nut when it comes to composing my shots, and I really want the option to go beyond 5X without dipping into digital zoom (and in JPEG format only, to boot), which can get me the effects I want but at a clear cost of clarity. Not that I'm all about the bird/wildlife shots. I just really like having greater control over how the background sizes up comparatively to the foreground. [Big ol' aside: If you're a fan, like me, of the flick 'Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,' you may recall a shot of Steve Martin walking from a car rental lot to the nearby airport hub while a rather large-ish jet plane screams by as it lands apparently just a few dozen yards from Martin. That's what a long-lens can do with how closer and farther images are perceived in a given shot (because of course Martin was nowhere near so close to the runway). Also, directors might call up long-range lenses for movies where they want to convey a cramped, claustrophobic feeling, such as aboard a submarine.]Now, when I say deal breaker, I mean that I've had my G12 for some three months, now, have fired off well over a two thousand  shots, and have only recently gotten the itch to explore something like the Canon SX30IS, with a megaton more of available optical zoom, albeit at a loss of access to shooting RAW. At this price point, one must make tough choices.A note about the design: When you're toting a G12 around with you, you may notice everyone else's digicams look so cool and sleek, whereas you've basically got a little black brick. Experienced photogs, of course, would eye the blessing of chunky controls on the top and note you've got a Serious Person's cam. But to everyone else, you may feel like a nerd who purchased too big and boring of a cam compared to the little silver and color-keyed models most folks tote. But you weren't shopping for a fashion accessory, were ya? Of course not.So, would I recommend it the G12? Absolutely and heartily, if zoom isn't a critical issue to you, and you're not ready to pony up for the dSLR, or even the 3/4, experience.""

It's quick, flash recharges quickly, the screen is nice and big, has a good 'feel' to it.  The battery will hold up for a long time even if you aren't taking photos.

People  are complaining about the size (it is not a lot bigger than my older A95)...the lack of better sensor (I have taken crystal clear images of the full moon and animals outside in total darkness)...and the fact it does great videos (the video results are top notch HD video...for those times when a video is worth a thousand still pictures...a waterfall for example). I personally see it as a great high quality all around use camera, for most people's actual needs. It is small and handy...takes great pictures...in very low light...and has the ability to capture video in a very nice quality format. You do not need a Cisco Flip...nor any other lesser video camera actually, as this one can do it all...and does it all very well indeed. The options are available to allow you to manually shoot...or you can use personalized settings manually...all of the options work very well. The only improvement would be to have a telephoto lense kit available for it...but that is not really what this camera is for. It is a go along anywhere...and shoot anything...with superior quality...sort of a camera, and I thoroughly enjoy having it.

"20110502","5.0","The best compact second body for Canon DSLR owners","I bought the G12 because my 'serious' bag with the 30D and all the heavy lenses and flashes has grown too big and expensive for travel and everyday tasks, not to mention intimidating to others. I had held buying a G-series camera from at least when the G10 came out, but now I finally took the plunge with the G12 and couldn't be happier.I am not really into 'auto' modes and shoot almost exculsively in raw format so I can postprocess with care in my PC later. What I really needed was a sharp lens, a good sensor and good ergonomics.The G12 does all of this, plus it is very fast, has great battery life, a hot shoe, remote trigger input, and plenty of very useful semiautomatic modes. The controls are of true EOS fashion and very easy to learn coming from a D-series camera. And the sensor quality is very nice, specially skin tones are gorgeous.The G12 is not a full DSLR replacement for many reasons, but it doesn't need or try to be one. It is a perfect little brother for the full size camera and it's going to be used 80% of the time.""

It lacked however the focal length to make it a useful camera.I purchased the teleconverter lens, hopeful that it would overcome the 5X out of the box capabilities. The extra lens however barely made a noticeable difference in zoom capabilities. I almost ordered a 3rd party add on 3.5X lens extension, but the reviews on that we poor. My only option is return this camera, since one of my wife's requests was good zoom capabilities.Canon would have a great camera system if they put the SX30's lens on the G12.

I hardly ever think of if this photo will be appreciated for the great photography skills employed while taking it. I give due attn to the frame composition, the lighting, the shadows, etc... but not too much time. Instead with every click I let the camera fire 3 frames in varying exposures, so I get more picture options per click to choose from. This camera allow me to set this very easily in various modes.Almost 7 out of 10 photos I take are people photos (either it's me and my wife, of family or friends and so on). This camera does a fantastic job of capturing faces and people even in situation with bad lighting (w/o using flash) - like outdoor dinners, etc...The 270 degrees rotating LCD allows me to position the camera in odd positions without actually getting myself into odd positions and lying on ground, climbing chairs, etc...The wide angle lens helps capture more into a frame in tight spaces like a room packed with people making merry, or a tall shot of a high rise structure in the background, etc...The only place I found this camera to be inadequate was when we recently visited a wild life reserve... but how often do regular folks do that???It starts up quickly, offers very good battery life, and is small enough to fit into your waist pouch while traveling, the battery recharges quickly, it's not that heavy, and a lot of the controls have dedicated buttons like SLRs so you can change settings really quickly...No I'm not suggesting it's an SLR, but if you are looking to keep it simple and get some great pictures without actually getting under the skin of a camera (which you can't not do with an SLR) then this is the best thing on the market!""

Sometimes all I want to do is review images, and I wish there was a way to do that without extending the lens every time, because I think it wears the mechanism out over time. That being said, I expect to get at least 3 or more good years out of it.""

"20110324","2.0","Nice Camera ....BUT","The camera as far as quality goes was great....  Excellent pictures, built solid, great feel, however, I found the my fingers always hitting the buttons on the back and activating the Micro button.  I didn't like the viewfinder at all, very hard to see through and the glare using outdoors was hard to work around.  Very unhappy with the zoom also as I like to shoot birds and it just didn't have the range I needed.  After about three days of frustration with the buttons and not being satisfied with the zoom, I decided to return the camera and look for something else.""
"20110324","5.0","So many features...","First - let me say that Canon is a company I would by anything from.  They have the best customer support I have dealt with in a long time.  This was for a previous product, not my new G12.Now, for the G12.  Awesome Camera.  I have read other reviews where they are comparing the camera to DSLR... and complain because it doesn't match up. Well, it shouldn't, this is not a DSLR, this (in my opinion) is a high end point and shoot.  If you want a DSLR, buy one.  If you want a camera that takes great pictures, has tons of extra settings (fish eye; color accent; miniature, are some of my favorites), allows for manual settings, and is also a simple point and shoot... this is it.  And, it is fairly small and easy to take out anywhere with you.  The only complaint I can say is that it has so many features, it is a bit tough to easily set the camera to what you want... but with plenty of use, I will memorize how to get what I want soon.  I highly recommend this camera... because of its features, picture quality, and Canon support!""

I take photos for articles that I send to the local newspaper, and this camera does a great job.  It is small enough to carry in my purse, so that it is always available.  I love the LED screen that swivels so that pictures can be taken from different angles.  Controls are easily accessible. Sturdy, well-made.Haven't checked the video yet, so can't evaluate that.

"20110319","5.0","Former Canon G7 user's review of Canon G12","First, I wish to point out that I have used the Canon G7 for the past 5 years and considering that it is not a DSLR, I absolutely loved the G7. However, having taken more than 10,000 photos with the G7, a total achieved from use between my wife and myself, the image sensor of the G7 began to intermittently 'flicker' with horizontal noise lines pulsating across the screen. These lines actually come out on some the images. So we knew it was time to ether repair or replace our G7. We opted to get the G12 because of Amazon's low price. The G7 uses the Canon Digic 3 processor and the G12 uses the Digic 4 processor. Both cameras are 10 Megapixel. But in using our new G12, right from the very first image we shot, it became immediately apparent that Canon has made huge progress in improving the G-Series PowerShot cameras! The images are now brighter, crisper, lines and edges are more sharp, the contrast is more accurate with darker blacks and truer whites, the colors are more vivid and the manner in which the camera is now able to automatically sense when to go from normal into macro focus, the new G12 is even easier to use than our G7. We also appreciate the new, larger, higher resolution screen, plus the fact that the screen now articulates; a feature we had missed on the G7 that our old Canon A80 had. We've had our G12 only about a month and we highly recommend this camera as possibly the best, affordable digital rangefinder-type camera on the current market. This is an excellent alternative to a DSLR or even a great backup camera for DSLR-owners! All this and in a convenient, compact package size that will still fit in a purse or large pocket.""
"20110318","5.0","Alone On Top?","I have owned several Canon cameras since the Film days. I migrated to an HP 4 megapixel camera and then to G6 from EOS 620 several years ago, and the last 2 years I have taken many wonderful photos with my G11. Recently upgraded to G12 & I must say I am extremely happy with this new camera. I have also had the opportunity to shoot with 6 other point & shoot cameras by Canon, Fuji, Sony, Nikon, Panasonic, Olympus and Kodak, either borrowed from friend & family, or purchased & returned for poor quality. In today's fast changing world of technology no product is perfect or if it is, it does not stay perfect for long. There is always that new innovation or breakthrough that leaves the previous gadget less desirable or even obsolete. As a knowledgeable amateur photographer my dream camera will be a 5' X 4' X 1/8' frameless camera with super hi resolution detachable wireless LCD display, 36 Megapixel extreme low light sensor, 18 to 480 zoom lens which does not extend beyond the body of the camera through it's full range, full resolution Raw shooting of 20-30 frames/sec. A built-in flash with the range of at least 150 feet, color corrected infra-red illumination for shooting in complete darkness, super long lasting battery & a TB of internal storage. And, of course waterproof to at least 100 feet without the need for external housing and so forth and so forth. Well, sometime during the next few decades my dream camera will come to existence and g12 will not even score a single star compared to it, but for now even though I agree with some of the other reviewer's critical points, I have to give my G12 5 stars since I can not find another camera in it's class that can do as well in all categories. And for those who say G12 is not much of an improvement over G11, look again. My G12 performs better and faster than my G11 with a few new features, besides taking super sharp photos, that have proven extremely practical in my everyday shooting, like horizontal level indicator which no one talks about and comes in quite handy when using the LCD in swivel mode, and yes I've had great success in low light shooting as well.""

"20110309","5.0","Very pleased with the camera!","I know very very little about cameras so had to ask my friends who know rather well about cameras & read lotssss of reviews online before buying this one.

The photos & videos came out very nice (for my standards :) ) I'm learning to use more functions of this camera & hopefully one day I can take more 'professional photos' :)Just to add one thing about the camera's case because it took me a long time to search at stores in Idaho & online. The ones I saw at the stores are either too small or too big. The ones have good reviews on Amazon for this camera are too big (for me to carry around because I only need the case that can protect the camera, not the one that can hold battery charger, flash, etc... like a pro.). Luckily I found 'Case Logic' which fits the camera well & the charger at Walmart for &lt; $14. So just to add this note in case you just want to look for a simple case.""
"20110308","5.0","Loving mine","A photographer friend of mine had secured a 'proper' SLR camera for me when I went away for the weekend and another friend of mine had the G12.  I fell in love instantly.  Since I could get the G12 for much the same price I decided to go with it.  (My photographer friend recommended the G12 in any case.)Note: the G12 is a camera that sits between a compact and a SLR.  So it has some benefits of both but also a few disadvantages.I'm fantastically happy with the product for the following reasons:- the swivel viewer is great for self portraits or pictures in funny angles- the automatic function is complimented by manual features- its small enough to carry around without being cumbersome- its affordable- battery lasts ages- great quality photos - colour imagery and apeture is fantastic on auto- great zoom- it has a viewfinder as well (compact cameras often dont)- its apparently a great camera for beginner photographers because its easy to move to proper SLRs- decent (although complicated) software that accompanies the cameraThings I dont like:- the built in flash is horribly bright (manual settings can adjust this but still make it bright) - I dont know if the detachable flash is any better- the zoom is built in (this is both an advantage and a disadvantage - it means that you dont have to lug around a huge lens (and without the cost of buying one) but if you need one you have to get a converter and then another lens adding to the cost)- the manuals are electronic (camera and software) which means you have to print it yourself (over 200 pages).  I havent bought a 'fancy' camera before so I dont know if this is standard, but given the expense, I think it would be fair to provide a manual (at least for the camera).All in all I am very happy with it, I am able to take professional looking photographs without trying!I highly recommended product.""
"20110307","5.0","superb performance so far","It's been a month since a bought the Canon PowerShot G12 from Amazon via DHL courier, and so far i am impressed with the performance and features. Let me also commend Amazon and DHL for never failing to deliver the goods in less than the time they promised. note that I already bought lots from this online retailer, and I'm from the Philippines. package came just 3 days, in mint condition..now the product itself, maybe the first thing i love with this camera is that the images and features are very much like a DSLR, only in a small package. I bought this product under the consideration that i need a compact DSLR-like camera, with full manual controls but with little footprint everywhere, it is small enough to be carried with me everyday from home to office to places i love.let me also clear that the video on this thing is very good, and IT CAN ZOOM while shooting, as opposed to most reviews that say it can't.the camera has MONSTER controls, everything literally at your fingertips, everything is easy and logical to setup, from trying to achieve shallow focus to accessing special 'tricks' like miniature effect and nostalgia effects.advanced features that works as promised include ability to lock focus, track moving subjects, very very impressive low-light capabilities where you can set a certain ISO threshold even when in AUTO mode, image stabilization works absolutely perfect even in low light conditions and maximum zoom, a mute mode, as well as the flexibility to add different filters and external flash. the camera can also accept the latest 32GB SD cards, even the SDXC ones.also commendable is the movable lcd, which REALLY helps in hard angles when shooting, like very low shoot or very high subject shooting.to conclude, for those who are looking for a very capable camera that is not as huge and costly as maintaining a DSLR, but compact enough to be able to bring everywhere, this is the right thing for you.""

"20110305","5.0","Love it!","I'm so incredibly happy with this purchase. I did A LOT of research before I bought it. Waited a while so I knew this was the right one and it most definitely is.It has manual controls, but overall is still easy enough to use that I didn't have to glance too much at any instructions before I was taking pretty decent pictures. The more I've been playing with it, the better the pictures get. I know I still don't understand a lot about the features and yet it takes such amazing pictures.I really enjoy the feel of the camera, feels hefty - in a good way. To me, something feels 'higher quality' when it's a bit more weighty. This isn't heavy by any means, just feels high quality. I have tiny hands though, so maybe that's why. I saw plenty of people saying it 'felt cheap' but I have no clue where that could come from.Battery life is great, I played with it for a few hours here and there and took a few hundred at least in an hour. Not even one little bar from the battery is gone. I'm glad this is something I wont have to worry much about, especially considering I got a spare ahead of time just in case.I love the manual controls and I also enjoy the fact that they aren't extremely easy to turn, so you don't bump them and change something accidentally.Everything about this camera makes me very happy and I honestly have nothing bad at all to say about it. If I think of anything, I'll revise this, but I doubt I will. :P""
"20110304","5.0","this one shoul do","Updated from G10, what an improvement with this one! Finally we realized that pixel quantity is not everything for a good image quality. Of course, like all cameras this one has shortcomings: swivel screen good have a better resolution; built in wireless flash control would be a huge bonus. Miniature, fisheye, poster functions are nice new features that cut the time in the post processing, much better sensor than G10. My bet on next G series we will see CMOS sensor, hopefully bigger too. Would it make you a better photographer or a better camera expert? That's what you should ask yourself on the next one. I'm sticking with this one for a while. Unless next one comes along with red eye and new function- clothes removal- just by selecting which function you prefer.  Avedon? Brassai? LaChapelle? Or even Warhol? Picasso? We always forget is not P, Tv, Av, M or A . It is always-Be You.""

The folks at Wolf Camera are always amazed when I take in a file to have blown up and I tell them what I took it with. I've also used the G10 at work taking photos for a website that I master. I'm so happy to see that the flip-out/twist LCD has been brought back with the G12, its absence on the G10 was my only complaint. The importance of this feature cannot be understated-it allows you take shots at angles that impossible without it.

The functions can be rather confusing but the capabilities are rather impressive. The miniature model mode is a lot of fun and I shot a couple interesting images.If you enjoy carrying a point and shoot that will also shoot video, I can recommend the G12.

"20110216","5.0","Modern Marvel","How do they do this for under 500 dollars!!!  How often do you kick yourself for not having your DSLR?  How often do you leave the house and say to yourself 'nah, I don't feel like lugging it along'?  This little camera has solved the 'dowp I wish I had my camera problem' for me 100%.  The images I am getting are as good if not better than those I have gotten with my 20D and the key is that I am getting the images because I have the camera all the time.  Rangefinder is not quite useless but I guarantee you wont want to use it much.  The large swiveling LCD is just amazingly bright and accurate and will allow you to get shots you could never pull off if you had to be viewing through the rangefinder.  5 star point and shoot performance but the camera really comes to life in the program mode and manual modes.  Really more versatile than my full size DSLR.  Very comfortable to wear over the shoulder.  Designed such that it lays flat against the rib cage and does not bob or swing at all.  I do not even feel that it is there really.  I think this is a great camera for people who do like to shoot in non automatic modes and geek out a little bit with their photography.  If you just want a point and shoot this is overkill.Two things to know before you buy: 1. It is true that the function set button in the center of the control dial on the right rear of the camera is placed in such a way that it is very very easy to depress with the base of your thumb and change your settings in very significant ways.  On a recent outing I ended up shooting all of my shots in a 1:1 ratio (little squares!) because of this issue.  This is a camera for a person who does not mind being alert and watchful vis a vis what the camera is up to from shot to shot.  I do feel that I will be able to overcome this button issue with more practice and the development of some muscle memory.  2. Zooming in and zooming out is very slow and clunky on this camera..just know that...this is not the camera to use for really fast paced shot composition.Bottom line?  Ridiculously low price given what is packed into this super fun yet serious little gem.  I say GO FOR IT!  Oh and BTW the HD video is really, really good.""
"20110216","1.0","Cheapskate Canon","Being a photographer for 50+ years I have learned some valuable lessons. Amongst them is one of the most important: always take an extra battery and the owner's manual. Now Canon, in order to be 'environmentally conscious' is only giving a PDF version of the full owner's manual. Hogwash! It's saving them bucks!! Meanwhile in order to take the manual on a shoot I either have to lug a laptop or a tacky, large home printed version.Bad decision, Canon. The G12 is pretty nifty, but you don't even make a printed manual available. I doubt it will save paper, home printed versions will use more. However it will help fill the coffers of the Canon bank account. Shame on you, Canon. Make a printed version available.I wonder what Nikon is doing?""
"20110215","5.0","Great, (but could have been even better?)","Canon Powershot G12 - First ImpressionsI was still shooting with an Olympus 3040z - a prosumer model from the early part of last decade, so it was high time for a new camera!  Based on a series of `specs' I devised, I narrowed my search to the G12, and the Nikon P7000.  These seemed like proper `spiritual successors' to my beloved Oly.  I briefly considered returning to an SLR (I've owned film units and have several older Canon EOS lenses), but just wanted a smaller, more easy to live with form factor.  Once I held them both, the Canon just seemed like the better choice.After living with it for a week, here are my first impressions.  Don't be put off by my comments - this is a terrific camera.  But it could have been better:1) For me lots of externally accessible manual controls was a must-have.  I was tired of searching thru menus for basics.  But who's idea was it to delete the printed manual???  This is a highly complex machine with knobs & buttons that in some cases serve multiple functions depending on the mode of operation.  Shooting/experimenting on the road with the .pdf manual at home on my desktop really bites.  I've printed out some guide material that I found on the previous G11, and will invariably have to print some of the manual as well.  I'm an electrical engineer with a firm understanding of optics & sensors, yet I'm still finding the learning curve to be steep!It has a great looking body, however, ergonomics could be better.  The various dials are a bit hard to move, particularly the front dial which like all Canon high end models is meant to be rotated with the index finger alone.  The lens zoom nub is way too small, and I keep slipping off of it.  And I keep hitting the * AE lock button by accident!  And countless times I partially blocked the flash output with my finger.  Oly did it better with the flash closer to the middle of the body.  I also miss the man-sized right grip.  Adding another few millimeters out to the plane of the retracted lens would have been nice.  I don't feel secure `one handing' the camera (at least not yet...). The lens ring is a tease - for show only.  It's too bad, as I would have loved an easy to use manual control of focus.  I believe that the S-95 (similar electronics in a compact body has a functional ring.2) An optical viewfinder was also essential.  I hate electronic viewfinders, and squinting at an LCD display in either bright sunlight or near total darkness is not for me.  It's also great as a battery saver.  Last weekend at 200 shots and several movies into a function, the battery icon began to flash.  I switched off the monitor and completed the next hour and 50+ shots with power to spare.  But this one is barely a viewfinder.  Not even a simple crosshairs?  And it is a bit far inboard.  The LCD monitor now has lots of nose prints!  The Oly had the viewfinder further to the left.  Again, great idea, poor execution.3) I miss the loss of a superfast f1.8 lens.  But compensating is the commendably low noise imaging chip that more than buys back several stops in low light situations.  I ran to ISO 1600 with respectable results.  And the image stabilizer is awesome!  I was knocking off back to back sub fifteenth of a second exposures with no blur.  Who needs a flash?4) No IR remote?  I loved the convenience of putting the old camera on a tripod and snapping off multiple shots without the need to be anywhere near it.5) I doubt that I will use RAW for casual shooting (too much post processing required), but the highest yield JPEG is still over-compressed for my taste.  I'm guessing something around 8:1, yielding files of about 2.1 meg from the 9 meg sensor.  (yes it says 10 meg if you want to shoot 3:4, but if you like 2:3 for easy 4' x 6' prints without cropping each one, you'll probably shoot in the reduced sensor region).  I suspect that you could do greater cropping & enlargements if the camera supported lower compression (3:1 maybe?).  Who cares if the files are larger?  5 meg would be fine, considering memory is virtually free and unlimited!  I bought a 16 gig SDHC (speed rated `10') card for under $30, and the camera indicates I can shoot 6,700 photos or hours of video with this size card!6) Speaking of video, I was quite happy with normal room lit 720 x 1280 movies.  Yes, 1080 would have been nice, but this is still tons better than my 4 year old HDD camcorder that shoots at VGA and is more low light challenged!  But why not allow continuous autofocus and exposure control?  I could live with a little mechanical noise in exchange for better tracking of moving objects.Net of all this?  It's a terrific camera, and if Canon is listening the G13 has the potential to be perfect!!""
"20110215","4.0","Concert Camera","Picked this up because many concert venues will allow any camera with a replaceable lens.If the venue allows me to take in my 40D with one or more lenses I let my daughter use the G12.Can it match the still quality of my 40D, 30D or 10D? No. It doesn't.But does it work as a concert camera? Yes and it does pretty well.I tend to shoot Raw + Jpg on shutter priority mode.I do limit the ISO to no more than 1600.I'd prefer 800 or lower but you have to work with the light you have.I don't mind the noise so much since it is a concert and you expect some graininess to the images.The last concert I probably snapped close to 400 images and the battery was still going strong when we left.I have not had luck with video at teh few concerts that allowed video.The movie was really very good quality. But being up close (in the pit) the base pretty much killed the sound quality.Awesome video but terrible sound. Probably if I was a lot further away from the speakers I'd get a decent video.I also prefer still photography so maybe there is a trick to getting better sound closer to the speakers.Would I recommend the camera for this use...Yes.It also does well as a quick use camera for th wife and kids.And if you can keep to 400 ISO or lower the images aren't bad at all.It's not giong to match an SLR but for a point and shoot it does very well.Especially when I compare it to other cameras in it's class.""

Picture quality is always excellent in whatever shooting mode you chose. The only down side to picture quality is in high contrast situations such as shooting in strong sunlight with shadows - picture will either be great for the bright situation or the shadows, but not both.Other than that, and the camera being a bit on the bulky side, its always there as my second camera - the other being a DSLR. and now it has HD movies.There's not much difference between the the G12 and G11, other than a few settings and HD movies, but I am extremely happy with it.I'd fully recommend to anyone""
"20110213","5.0","Best Compact Camera","I upgraded my Canon SX200 to the G12 due to the limited range of low light shooting on the SX200. The S95 also has pretty good low light capabilities but the G12  has a hot shoe so you can add an external flash and add even more flexibility to shooting indoors or at night. The internal noise reduction keeps photos even up to ISO 3200 usable. Above ISO 800 the photos start to show some noise but you are able to capture some usable pictures that other compact camera's wouldn't be able to touch at all. The G12 puts a lot of the controls at your fingertips so you don't have to keep going into the menu to change settings. The ability to adjust the settings on the fly is a huge plus. I also like the ability to fold the viewer screen in on itself to protect it when putting it in your pocket or the camera bag. The camera is a bit on the chubby side for a compact but I have not had any issues carrying it around. Short of an SLR the pictures the G12 puts out are stunning. The exposure is rarely off when I evaluate it after the fact in Aperture. Like other reviewers the only button this doesn't have that would be nice is a dedicated movie mode button. Every other control I need other than that one is easily accessible.In short this is a great camera for the price Amazon sells it for and I have enjoyed using it ever since I purchased it.""
"20110213","5.0","Great Choice","Just purchased the G12 after months of reviews, hand held comparisons and more.  I am very satisfied.  The camera is great in the hand, easy to use, provides great images, and, the digital zoom gives the extra reach for those occasions when a bit more is wanted.  The built in flash is enough for most indoor shots. Nevertheless, I puchased the Canon Speedlite 270 which is a nice extra; the TAMRAC 5689 bag is excellent for the camera. This is a great choice and traveling companion.""

"20110207","5.0","very pleased","I moved up from having a powershot G7, which had the infamous internal loose screw that killed it, though it lasted almost 5 years which was better than many of that model.  It had been a camera that I loved.  I could walk and shoot without blur so long as it was not dark or dusk.  Indoor pictures without a flash came out fantastic when others around me used flash and had less than satisfactory results.  Well this new camera is an upgraded model that I am thrilled with.  I am not a professional photographer but with all the automatic features of this camera I get results that make me look like one.  I have a friend who is an avid amateur photographer who has several thousand dollars worth of equipment and he was impressed with this camera.  I highly recommend it, I love it.  Considering how much I loved the old G7, it caught me by surprise that with the newer technology I would love this camera even more.  I am not happy that my G7 committed suicide, but considering how many more features have become automatic in this G12, I am glad to upgrade.  Oh and the loose screw problem seems to have finally gotten fixed after the G9 model, so no worries.""
"20110207","4.0","I am NOT a Pro - so this is my review as such","I am not a professional photographer.  I can not go into great detail about all of the settings and fancy terminology that others can do  so if that is what you are looking for, you won't find it in this review.I AM an artist, however.  I have spent the last 20 years taking accurate color specific photos which need to have accurate texture as much as possible for posting photos of my art in many different media.When I was younger, I used to devour every inch of every tool that I had.  I would learn it inside out and study it until it became like an extension of my hands.  Unfortunately life has crowded out my time and ability to study things so I am forced to learn things off the cuff and fly by the seat of my pants.This can be a problem, however, when it comes to having a very refined taste in photos with color and accurate texture, but only the time to run a quick set of photos.When my Kodak camera broke, I was very upset.  I had one of the nice Z series of Kodak cameras.  Although low light photos were a nightmare, the color intensity and accuracy always delighted my senses- especially when taken outdoors.The Canon G12 is both a huge step forward and a step back.WHAT I LIKEThe step forward is that in low light, this camera is unbelievable!  I can capture a photo in a pure dark room with a flash that I can not capture with most cameras in good artificial light.There are a ton of settings with the G12.  I can set them any way that I want to and that is really nice- except when I am in a hurry.The auto setting is adequate, but not quite as colorful as I would have hoped.The camera is solid and can stand on its own for self portraits and a timer.The intense color setting does a great job in some instancesThe camera is easy to hold and I have no problems adjusting to itThe back screen flipping around for self portraits is fabulous- I take a ton of those and this is a huge help.The lens is FAST- retracts and goes out really quickly.After not using the camera for a few moments, the lens does retract back again into the camera, but if you press the button lightly that takes photos, it comes out quickly again.WHAT I DON'T LIKEThe camera can be a bit heavy and cumbersome when I am attempting to hold it with one hand out of necessity (when photographing my arm or hand).The color capture of this camera is nice outside but in subdued light- photos look washed out.  I am well acquainted with photo editing and do use it, but it is a bit more challenging with the G12.The neck strap can sometimes get in the way when using one hand for photos- but it is a bit too heavy for a wrist strap- although I would like to have that security in case I drop it like I did my other camera.The manual has to be printed out which annoys me to no end.  For a camera this expensive, you would think they would include a manual.  This makes it really hard to learn how to use this camera.I know that some people feel you need to know photography rather than a manual, but I find that I would like to learn this tool, and am very frustrated without inclusion of a manual.I have not used this camera at all near to its potential.  As a point and shoot camera on auto- it is adequate and for most people would probably be just fine.  For the other features, there is no manual at all, unless you print it out, which takes ink and paper.I do love the camera so far, although the color saturation is not quite what I am used to, I will learn to work with it.  The lovely low light capacity of this camera makes up for it, I guess.I have given this four stars because of the lack of manual mostly and the auto mode not being quite as accurate as I would have hoped.But the G12 is such a nice camera in other ways, it is still close to five stars despite my disappointments.""
"20120417","5.0","Awesome camera!!!","This is an awesome camera very easy to use. I always carry this camera with me. as a photo student, it's convenient to carry when i dont feel like carrying my canon 60D. so many nice ways to use this camera, i use it mostly in manual mode. The pictures are crystal clear and the picture sizes you can get are amazing. I would recommend the G12 to anyone who wants a lightweight, portable camera that gives awesome results.""
"20120415","5.0","A solid, adaptable camera","I bought this one a few months ago after extensive searching for a solid, well built camera that could create sharp photos and allow considerable creative control.It has met my expectations. Its build is definately better than most cameras, and the G12 feels more solid than most entry level DSLRs with bodies or lenses that creak. The 5X zoom covers the vast majority of what I want to do with a camera. The number of exposure options and creative filters are staggering, yet you have the option to set everything for 'auto' if you prefer. I really like the numerous manual control buttons for instant access to items such as ISO settings, exposure compensation, etc. The control dial is a bit touchy and requires some practice to avoid setting off the wrong function. The ability to fit filters and external flash units is another plus missing from most smaller cameras. I strongly recommend getting a Canon filter adapter and a 58mm circular polarizer filter (CPL), to naturally enhance color saturation while reducing haze and reflections.As for bags, I wanted one that could fit all these accessories, including an extra battery, battery charger, cable and extra memory cards. The Lowepro Edit 110 works great for this, and it is well built too.""
"20120406","5.0","BEWARE OF UNSCRUPULOUS TRADE-IN MERCHANT FOR CANON G10","The Canon Powershot G12 is a superb camera. Honestly, I cannot say anything bad about it. I used a G10 for two years and decided to upgrade to the G12. I was pleased to see that I could trade-in my G10 through Amazon. And here is where my review gets ugly. I decided to post this here--even though it doesn't really belong here--because I think it is where anyone who is thinking about trading in a G10 will be most likely to read it. And I want to warn as many people as possible so they are not ripped off by a dishonest merchant like I was.On the day I decided to trade-in my camera, the trade-in value for the G10 was advertised as $199 for 'Like New' condition and $153.50 for 'Good' condition. In my honest opinion, my G10 was 'Like New,' and I still had the original box and all accessories. I thought $199 was a fair value, so I packaged up my G10 and sent it in. I requested that it be returned to me if the condition was not found to be 'Like New.'Upon receipt and inspection, the merchant informed me that the condition was not 'Like New,' but rather was 'Good' because it was 'lightly scratched' (his exact words). I thought about it and decided that $153.50 was fair, even though the camera was not visibly scratched. I called Amazon immediately to tell them I would accept the trade-in value of $153.50 and to try to stop the camera from being returned to me. I was told it was too late; the camera had already been shipped. Interestingly, however, I checked the UPS tracking system, and the camera actually did not ship out until two days later.In any event, I decided to wait until the camera was returned to me, and then resubmit it as a new trade-in. When I received the camera back, I was very upset to see that the merchant had packed it only in an envelope, and not a box with bubble wrap inside, as I had. This resulted in the camera box being damaged during shipment. So I found another box and packaged it up correctly, so it wouldn't be damaged in transit. This time, I specified that I would accept the trade-in value EVEN IF THE CONDITION WAS DOWNGRADED. How could that happen, right? I mean, the camera was inspected only a few days earlier, and the merchant determined that its condition was 'Good.'First indication of a problem: As I was completing the online form to submit the trade-in, I noticed the advertised trade-in values had changed dramatically from just one week earlier, and the value of a G10 in 'Good' condition was now only $123.50. I called Amazon to inquire about this and was told that merchants are free to change their pricing whenever they like. I suppose that's true, but this still seemed really shady, since the merchant knew I had just submitted the camera for trade-in and now wanted to accept the originally advertised value of $153.50 for the condition it was rated. Amazon offered me a $10 promotional credit for my trouble.Today, I received an email from the merchant, who said he received and inspected my G10 and rated its condition as 'Acceptable'--not 'Good,' as he had only one week earlier--due to 'some flaws (e.g., dead spots or scratches in display), and minor cracks or dents' (his exact words). So yes, somehow the condition of my camera changed significantly within only a few days. Last week, it was only 'lightly scratched,' but this week, it had 'flaws, dead spots, scratches, cracks and dents???' I can assure you it did not. And here's the best part: Since I had specified I would accept whatever condition and trade-in value the merchant determined upon inspection, I was given only $70--and not the originally promised $153.50--because the condition of my camera was somehow now only 'Acceptable.'I am EXTREMELY upset. I contacted Amazon and was told nothing can be done because Amazon has no control over merchants. I find that really hard to believe, since Amazon facilitates the trade-in program, and an unscrupulous merchant like this one will clearly harm Amazon's reputation. Amazon would not even identify the merchant, so I have no way of contacting the merchant directly or submitting a formal complaint. So essentially, as I see it, Amazon permitted the merchant to 'steal' my camera. I cannot believe Amazon would allow this to happen to a customer, and a very loyal customer at that. I suppose because I was persistent, Amazon offered me a $20 promotional credit for my trouble.So, please be warned: DO NOT TRADE-IN YOUR CAMERA THROUGH AMAZON. I wish I had read a review like this before I did.""

"20120331","5.0","G9, G10, G11, and now G12 - I own and LOVE them all!","This camera continues a trend of fine pro-level consumer cameras that I've been a huge fan of.I used to carry a Nikon everywhere - but then I scheduled an overseas vacation and didn't feel like carrying all that heavy camera equipment.  That's when I bought a G9.  One trip and I was hooked.  It took great photos and it was so small and convenient.  It also took great videos.I loved the G9 so much that I bought a G10 when it came out, and later bought a G11 to use at the office.  This G12 was a birthday present for my wife (who has been using my old G9 until now), and she loves the upgrade.I don't care one way or another about the hinged screen (I don't really video or photograph myself as much as some people do - maybe I'm not as narcissistic as the Facebook generation), but one of the features I do like is the ability to zoom the video while you are shooting.These cameras are so good they made me into a 'former Nikon user'.""
"20120331","4.0","Split Personality","I shot exclusively with a G12 for a year.  I finally moved to a Micro Four Thirds system for reasons I'll get into later.  But the fact that the G12 didn't quite meet my needs in no way diminishes my general opinion of it as an excellent camera.The G12 is solidly built.  It won't go into many pockets, but it's not overly heavy.  The fit and finish oozes quality.  The rotating controls are solid and generous (a mode dial, a dedicated ISO knob, a dedicated exposure compensation knob, a front dial, and a rear rotary dial).  The rear rotary dial doubles as a set of four-way buttons, and this common design is always tricky to use, but you'll develop the muscle memory to use it effectively.If you've never used an articulated display, it is a joy.  It's hard to understand how useful it is until you use it, and it's something I really miss with my new camera.  As with everything else, the G12's implementation of this feature is first-rate.  It's easy to move it around, but you never feel like it's going to fall apart in your hands.  It makes all kinds of composition easier: shooting from the hip, lifting the camera into the air, shooting around corners, getting into tricky positions.  Don't underestimate this feature.  The screen is nice and bright, and you get a good view of your pictures.The lens is worthy of the Canon name.  Nice and sharp.  It's fairly bright at the wide angle, but the f/2.8 is clearly one of the compromises for getting a 5x zoom lens; that is, it's one of the factors in the G12's indoor-light struggles.The sensor is significantly bigger than that of most compact cameras, but it's still a small-sensor camera.  Despite this, the image quality is superb.  Colors are natural and pleasing in most lighting conditions.  Where the small sensor size hurts the G12 is by making it difficult to shoot indoors without flash.The provided flash is fairly powerful, but its positioning close to the lens makes it prone to red-eye.  If you buy a G12, do yourself a favor and invest in the 270EX or 270EXII flash.  G12 + 270EX is a great indoor combination, and that particular flash is perfect for the G12's size.  You can also bounce light off a surface (for example, the ceiling) with the 270EX, and that can make a huge difference in getting natural-looking lighting.The G12's autofocus speed is lackluster.  My primary subjects are my children, and I was never able to get candid shots exactly when I wanted to.  The autofocus is accurate, and things like subject tracking and face recognition are very well done.  It's GOOD at focusing, just not fast at focusing.  The G12 does have a manual focus option, but it's frankly not even worth mentioning.The viewfinder is useful on occasion.As nice as the G12 is, shooting with it gave me a good education in what I wanted in my next camera.  I wanted to be able to take pictures indoors without a flash, and without cranking the ISO way up.  I wanted to be able to isolate subjects with selective focus, but the G12's slow-at-telephoto lens and small sensor really make that difficult.  And I wanted an autofocus system that would let me get candid shots immediately.I found what I was looking for in an Olympus Micro Four Thirds system, but there are things about the G12 I regret leaving behind.  The articulated display, the nice array of manual controls, and even little things like an orientation sensor, are not included in my new camera.  And getting a decent macro will require me to buy a macro lens, whereas the G12 can take very nice macro shots.I got some great pictures with the G12 in the last year.  I got some great sports shots, despite the slow autofocus, but anticipating the action.  I got some great indoor shots by maximizing available light and using the shoe-mounted flash.  So its limitations can be handled.  But it's at its best with things that don't move fast that are outdoors.  Landscapes, nature photography and daytime street shooting are the G12's strengths.  And it wasn't TOTALLY out of its depth for my purposes (photographing young children), but there were better options.""

"20120327","4.0","A very nice 2nd camera","Bought this camera for my wife as our 2nd camera. I have a regular dslr. She had been using a pocket size Canon. Hated it, a mickey mouse camera. Too small, no advanced features, and most important, could not shoot RAW.She wanted a compact camera with no lens to change so this was the choice.This camera a huge improvement. An optical view finder when the sun too bright to see the screen. Can put in Program mode easily. Aperture, priority modes, a better lens, and most important takes a RAW picture. That one feature is so huge. Jpg pictures are so limiting to fix up compared to RAW. For me, RAW a must for any camera.  I think a great 2nd camera. Why 2nd? because I like a larger sensor and larger lens. If this was our one and only, would have bought the new Canon G1X if just wanted one compact camera. This new one has a very larger sensor and larger lens to match the sensor.Been very happy with the picture quality, the extra features, the ability to easily change the white balance. This is basically a compact version of a regular dslr. The camera is advertised as such, and it is true. I would reccomend buying the Dave Busch G12 camera book. Really explains how to run all the features. The camera manual is just on a disc. I like a book to read and take notes.""

"20110202","4.0","To much of a good thing","Having waited to many years for Canon or Nikon to introduce an affordable digital range finder prompted me to move forward before my Pro Nikon D2H outfit becomes totally worthless.  I traded my f2.8  Nikon 80-200 even for this camera.  I knew the lens was worth more but I didn't want to deal with the hassle of placing adds, etc.  This camera does more than it needs to!  Reading the over 200 page manual gave me a head ache.  This camera is capable of doing everything including washing your dishes.  I believe this camera should be simplified for photographers with a higher skill level.  Skilled photographers don't require wink detectors or light dimmers.  We want to shoot the highest quality images we can 90 % of the time.  Full auto is always a welcome feature when conditions dictate, but the ability to easily shoot in aperture and speed priority  is in my mind the most important. This camera is capable of doing this once you pick through its extensive menu.  Once you read through the manual and pick out the features that are important to you this is a very capable camera.  This is a solid well built camera and I'm going to have alot of fun carrying it around with me everywhere I go. ( also, purchase the Canon 58 mm filter adapter to protect the fragile extending lens)  If like me you are tired of waiting for Nikon or Canon to introduce an affordable range finder this camera should fill the bill until they do.""

Seems like everyone I demonstrated the functionality to ends up buy one as a backup camera.... especially if they typically use a DSLR.  I originally purchased this for travel overseas and from here on out, it will be the only travel camera we use since it doesn't require a multitude of lenses.  The new built-in HDR feature is great.  Just back from the Grand Canyon and the photos are excellent.  The high ISO capability with low noise is also incredible.  Shot a time exposure of the Grand Canyon with a 3/4 moon and it looked like dusk in the canyon with stars and constellations visible.  The only down side is a lack of 'bulb' setting, and the photographer is limited to a 15-sec time exposure.  The ability to shoot movies with this camera makes it one of the best point-and-shot cameras on the market.  Can't wait to see what Canon does next with this series.""
"20110131","5.0","The PERFECT "in-between" camera!","I had been considering getting one of the G-series cameras ever since I held a friend's G-9 a few years ago.  The enhancements made to the G-12 pushed me over the edge to take the plunge. The swivel screen, conversion to HD (720p) video, addition of HDR in-camera processing, additional creative 'scene' modes and improving low-light sensitivity are all welcome features on an already feature-rich camera. I am a long-term photo hobbiest and I am seldom without a camera.  I have two Canon DSLR's and a Canon pocket camera. The DSLR's tend to live at home unless I am going on vacation or to a major event and the pocket ELPH is short on features.  While the G-12 is a little heavy and boxy to be considered a true pocket camera, it is small enough to keep with me on most of my walking expeditions. Pictures are gorgeous and the numerous creative features never cease to impress.""
"20110128","5.0","Very happy with this camera.","I am a 35mm film person, I have always disliked the look of digital photos so buying a digital camera was a huge decision.  I was looking for something that had full manual control, a decent zoom and a quick shutter without lag time between photos.  But I had decided I did not want to get a DSLR as this camera was going to be more of my everyday camera; didn't want to carry around a lot of equipment.This camera and a Nikon were both recommended as a good 'cross over' camera.  It seems to have a lot of the same qualities as a DSLR but with a fixed lens.  I chose the Canon because the reviews I read comparing the Canon to the Nikon favored the Canon for the quick shutter.I have not yet used all the features but so far am very please with the photo quality and ease of use.  I love being able to take photo after photo without waiting between pictures.  I have used the Auto mode for the general vacation photos but also used the manual mode for more dramatic photos at night.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the night photos, clear, good resolution, no noise.Two things I do not like: the flip out screen and the zoom.  When I compared on line the Nikon and the Canon these were two items that made me lean towards the Nikon as it has a fixed screen and a higher power zoom but the Canon had better overall reviews.Will still be using the old reliable Nikon 35mm SLRs for some photo work but am so far very happy with the quality of the Canon G12.""

Good for taking pictures holding the camera at arms length over your head.Really like being able to go into the two manual modes and manual focus.  My Elfs won't do that. Takes nice night time pictures.Battery seems to last forever during normal operation.  Takes hundreds of pictures between chargings.Minuses:It's very difficult to pick up without pushing a button.  There are buttons on every surface.  One has to spend time figuring out which button got inadvertently pushed.Won't optical zoom while taking movies.  This is a huge drawback.  Yes, it will digital zoom, but digital zoom is not desireable for many reasons.Will not turn itself off while connected to the computer.  Instead, it runs the battery down.  It's very easy to forget that it's on after downloading pictures and working with them.  Come back a few hours later and you have a dead battery.Battery does not charge when plugged into the computer (like my GPSs).

"20110118","5.0","Love my G12!","I've been a fan of Canon PowerShot. The first one I used was A200 that I borrowed from my friend before buying the A590 two years ago. While I love my A590, I find it difficult to take pictures in low lightning. When I set foot to get a new camera, I was debating between G12 and S95. The two of them have very similar specs, except S95 is smaller and has aperture priority starting at 2.0. However, when I went to Best Buy to take some test shots, the S95 is too small for me. I felt like I could drop it at any moment. Also, I took about 10 shots and about 3 of them were blurry. With the same specs, the G12 did not even fail to take a blurry photo. The images were sharp and it felt right in my hands, despite a bit heavier than my A590. Still, I debated on whether I should get the G12 until I saw it on sale. At the time I purchased it, G12 was slightly cheaper than S95! I ordered it with 1 day shipping and it arrived promptly.As soon as I took it out of the box, I immediately began to play with it. The G12 is very user-friendly. I tested it under my very bad indoor lightning and it did not fail to take good pictures. Among the 300+ photos I took until the battery ran out, I only found 1 or 2 out of focus pictures. The colors are true and the pictures look very artistic. A lot of people who saw my pictures were surprised at the quality. The extra features such as color swap, fish eyes, and miniature mode are nice and also very easy to use. I took some portraits and my skin looked so smooth.Despite it being a bulky camera, the G12 is the best camera I've ever used. Again and again, I keep on recommending Canon to people who are looking for new cameras. Although the battery life needs improvement and the lens can be a bit faster, the G12 is a beast. Even in very low lightning and the lens about 1cm to the object, this camera manages to produce some unbelievably sharp pictures. It's like I don't even have to do the work! All I need to do is to click a button. Yes, it's THAT amazing!""
"20110114","5.0","Great LITTLE camera","Getting ready for a long international vacation, I took my trusty Nikon D70 to the camera store for a cleaning.  The guy at the camera shop said 1: you can't really clean these, they're disposable, and 2: this camera had enough clicks on it that it wouldn't be reliable.  So much for supporting local camera shops... as soon as I got it home the card stopped responding reliably, and there's no easy way to tell if the card is bad, or the camera is making the card go bad...So, long story not so long, I asked a professional photographer friend of mine what I should do - spend $900 or $1300 for a new Nikon that supports all my lenses?  He said, sure, and also get a Canon G12.  More reliable, equivalent photo quality, great zoom range, and about 1/8 the size, when you factor in lenses.  And of course 1/2- 1/4 the cost.  Knowing that the best travel photos are the impromptu quick shots, I decided to hold off on replacing the Nikon and just take the Canon - what a great decision!  The photos are fabulous, the battery life is amazing, even with lots of flashes, and the ability to quickly and accurately set manual or program settings is actually easier than on the Nikon!  I shot mostly with Aperature Priority, and some with shutter Priority, but I could also set it for full auto in about 1/2 second, hand the camera to somebody else, and be in a great shot.  Being able to flip the screen around lets you take pictures of yourself and family easily, and the screen has lots of different options for settings and playback that makes it great to look at.  I got lots of compliments on the camera and the photos.  My only wish is that I could get a little bit wider angle shots - I'm an architect and take lots of wide angle interior and exterior pictures of buildings, but it wouldn't have been worth travelling with the big camera just for those times when I wanted the extra view width.  I'd probably agree with other reviewers that the viewfinder isn't very useful. There isn't any information in there, so it ends up only helping with the basic shot composition, which the screen does just as well...Great camera!""
"20110111","3.0","Great camera (Canon); poor customer service (Amazon)","One short week after I purchased this camera at Amazon it went on sale with a competitor (Best Buy and Fry's Electronics) for $50 less.  I called Amazon about their 'price protection' policy and was told that 'it was not something we do'.  They said I could return the camera but I would be charged a standard 20% ($100) restocking fee plus have to pay the shipping.  The woman (supervisor) I spoke with was very smug and indifferent about the situation and seemed like she could care less if I ever shopped at Amazon again.  I guess Amazon has so much business they don't need to provide good service to current customers.  I have used and been very satisfied with Amazon for years but the service has definitly changing for the worse.I also see in this economy that Best Buy has greatly improved their customer service practices and have dropped the brutal practice of charging a restocking fee when a customer is unhappy about a purchase and wishes to return it - they also offer solid price matching and price protection.  Both local retailers are also very competitive in pricing - even with online retailers.  This has convinced me to shop locally and let companies with poor service like Amazon suffer the consequences.The camera gets 4/5 stars; Amazon gets 2/5.""

"20110110","5.0","excellent for my particular purposes","First let me tell you my biases, so  you can judge whether my experiences might apply to your interests or not.I am an amateur photographer with a professional interest in people, urban scenes, and liveability of cities. I take mostly travel photos of cities in Europe, and some photos of my family here at home. These are quite restricted purposes compared to many photographic hobbyists. Naturally if you shoot macro, or RAW,  or blow up the image larger than what I have suggested below, or make large prints, or do landscapes a la Ansel Adams, or do sports, or exhibit in museums, or do  careful portraits with  lots of bokeh, or wish to sell your photos, then what I am about to say below is irrelevant to your needs and experiences. I exhibit my photos on my 15 inch Mac Book Pro computer and I don't make prints. I do email photos to people. So far I just shoot in jpeg not RAW. This too is quite a restricted way of approaching photography but it is my way.I have been interested in photography for many decades and always wanted a Leica when I was a teen ager and never could afford one. But I was won over to SLR s by the great through the lens views. I also preferred very compact unobtrusive cameras. I owned many of the Olympus Pen compact film half-frame cameras, then the Pen FT half frame SLR, and then the Olympus OM1. Then film cameras went out of style and I switched to digital. I used first a Nikon 5000 compact  digital camera and when that was stolen, used a Sony W1 point and shoot, and have over 15,000 photos on my computer. Many of these were very satisfying from my point of view.. My goal is to take photos that are interesting as opposed to exhibition quality..I chose the G12  because of my preference for an optical viewfinder, which the Sony W1 also had and which I used a great deal, for moving subjects, that is adults walking in cities, and children playing. This has been a very good decision for me with the G12. I don't mind the 77 percent coverage of the optical viewfinder, I can always crop with iphoto in the Mac .It is also very helpful in direct sunshine, where as a traveler I take most of my photos. I would never buy a camera without it.I have owned the G12 for two months and have been very pleased.However four things surprised me greatly about the G12; to me they were totally unexpected:1.My night time and very low light results with my compact cameras were often unsatisfactory but I  shoot very predominantly in the day and didn't realize that a compact camera could do better in low light. So when I bought the G12 I was not thinking of this and was hugely surprised at how good it is in low light.2. I find that the articulating screen is very valuable for composition, and is also very valuable for unobtrusive and unintrusive photos of people, and now that I have it I would never buy a camera without one. It is hard to use for vertical photos though and here I use the optical viewfinder.3. My reason for buying the G12 was  to get sharper pictures than the Sony W1 in daytime outdoor shots. I was surprised to find that the G12 shots were only somewhat sharper, not dramatically sharper. The W1 is pretty sharp  under bright light.4. I had heard over and over that cameras with much larger sensors will give much sharper images and more detailed  than the G12  This I found to be definitely  the case in the dpreview laboratory tests. However it was not the case in the dcresource field tests. The images from the G12, the Olympus EP1, the Panasonic GF1, the Panasonic Zs7,  the Canon T1 and the Canon 50D, on the dcresource web sites for those cameras, using the photos of the same Chinese restaurant building in San Francisco,  clicked on to get full size, and downloaded to my Mac, are, incredibly, of about equal sharpness and detail. Differences if any are really minimal. This is true even if you use the #1 magnification factor on the Mac, in effect blowing the image up to about 14x 20. Try this procedure and make your own judgments. I chose the restaurant building photo on a sunny day since as I said above, so many of my photos are of urban scenes outdoors in various cities.The G12 is, alas, too large for a shirt pocket, unlike the Sony W1,  but fits fine into a slacks pocket (I don't wear jeans so that is not an issue). I have found an OPTEC Mini neoprene case to be a great protection against bumps but still very compact so the camera can go into a slacks or jacket pocket with the case on it.A few words on some of the settings:I have found it helpful to turn off the camera sound:  it makes the sound of the zoom mechanism and the shutter much less obtrusive. I also turn off the flash as often as possible, for the same reason, being less obtrusive. I am experimenting now with turning off the AF Assist light except in very low light situations,  since it emits a blue light that can be seen on the camera itself and as a brief blue blur on the object being focused on; I am trying to be as unobtrusive as possible and apparently AF works fine in almost all light conditions without the AF Assist light being on.Recently I tried setting  the g12 to the combined setting of vivid color and increased contrast (this is one setting) to make the images a bit more saturated and contrasty, but I found out that it makes the colors fluoresce, which I don't like;  the resulting colors seem to me to be unnatural and plasticky, like those at Disney World.  I find it is better to  increase color saturation and contrast by using the 'enhance' setting on iPhoto; it is less drastic.The Auto/Auto setting lets the camera go only as high as ISO 1600. The Low Light setting lets the camera go as high as ISO 3200, hence with a higher shutter speed.  I don''t notice much difference in the photos as a result.The Quick Shot setting lessens the shutter lag a bit but the shutter lag is so short anyway that I don't use this setting much.My complaints: the zoom control is pretty crude so it is hard to zoom to get the exact framing I want.I have been looking curiously  at the Olympus XZ1 recently but the sample gallery images on the dpreview web site don't look very sharp to me. Plus it has no optical viewfinder and no articulating screen. If it does turn out to be very sharp, it might be an alternative to the G12 for those who don't want an optical viewfinder and an articulating screen, since the XZ1 zoom lens is very fast throughout its range, and the  XZ1 bulk and weight are less than the G12..I hope this will be of help to those of you, perhaps only a minority, whose interests are similar to mine. I think people have very different photographic styles and so what is fine for one person may not be at all suitable for another. This is obvious from the sharp differences of opinion found in internet postings on cameras.For me, the G12 has been a wonderful camera.Raphael W.""
"20110109","5.0","Excellent Point & Shoot - One of the best","My first digital camera was a Canon G1. I've sold several photos that I took with that camera, the photo quality was that good. I then upgraded to a G3 but eventually then moved up to the Canon 20D and a nice set of lenses for it. However, I've wanted a good point and shoot for those situations for which the 20D is too large and heavy. However, the G series was no longer as attractive because the newer versions didn't use Raw format. However, Canon finally added this valuable capability to back to the cameras in this series. I don't know which of the previous versions might have had it but at least the G12 does. And not only does it have this capability but it's image quality is absolutely superb. I usually use the P setting with auto ISO and I have not been disappointed with any of the shots that I've taken so far. I've now owned the camera about a month. I still use my 20D for more serious work and it definitely has some advantages over the G12 including shorter shutter lag and focus time. But the 20D is a fantastic stand-in when I don't want to or can't carry the hefty 20D and its stable of lens with me. I highly recommend the G12 to anyone who is serious about photography and wants to take excellent photos. It is well worth the approximately $480 price that I paid and better than any other point and shoot that I've owned.""
"20110108","5.0","The Canon G12 for advanced photography","Hello, I am a part-time fine art photographer and my favorite subjects are landscapes, flowers, classic European architecture, travel, visual arts and crafts. I work with two DSLR systems but like to have with me a compact camera at all times for any eventuality. Depth of field, composition and sharpness are typically more important to me than very fast focusing and shooting (I work mostly in Av mode) but sometimes I need my equipment to be responsive enough to capture travel's fleeting moments.I have recently replaced my award-winning compact Fuji E900 with a Canon G12. Living not far from B&H in Manhattan, I had the chance to 'play' with it and the other two cameras I was considering - the Nikon P7000 and the Panasonic LX5 with its external EVF - before buying.  After putting the camera through its paces for a couple of weeks with my kind of photography I have come to the following conclusions.The G12 is an advanced compact camera larger than your average pocketable but smaller than a micro 4/3' or similar. It does not fit in a shirt pocket but it does it in a regular pouch together with your wallet, cell phone etc. (I never use photo bags to avoid advertising the equipment). The fact that it has some size and weight makes it more stable in my hands and allows for its numerous external controls.The camera's key features include a larger than average 1/1.7' 10Mp sensor with superior image quality in low light and higher ISO values, a sharp 28-140mm zoom lens, an optical viewfinder, a fully articulated LCD monitor, many dedicated external controls, manual exposure, Raw format, good responsiveness, reasonably fast autofocus even in low light, and a powerful flash.Beginning with the G11, Canon has dared bringing down the resolution of its G series sensors from 14Mp to 10Mp, which is more than enough for most users. This gutsy move has significantly reduced high ISO noise. I can make enlargements around 16x20' from the G12 with ISO 800 pics in good light and ISO400 in low light (in Raw format and proper processing in Camera Raw).The 5x zoom lens, even if not particularly bright, extends from a very useful 28mm wide angle to a 140mm short telephoto. This conservative zoom range covers most of my typical photography, keeps the lens sharp through every focal length and reduces distortions and aberrations. Some kinds of photography can be done with inexpensive equipment but true wide angle and telephoto work requires high quality, expensive equipment and solid technique (if you are serious about your photography stay away from superzoom cameras). The zoom control is a bit on the sensitive side.Composing with an LCD monitor is sometimes useful but generally awkward and unstable, does not help you concentrate on your subject, and is downright impossible in bright light. The G12 offers an optical viewfinder which, while small and covering only 77% of the image, is often a life saver. When I worked with slide film I strove for a final crop in-camera. Then I moved to digital and learned the creative advantage of shooting wider and doing final cropping in processing. Hence the 77% viewfinder coverage is not an issue for me, I just shoot very tight.The camera has a sharp 2.8', 461Kp fully articulated LCD monitor hinged on the side (so that it is never in the way of the tripod head). There are specific shooting conditions where a monitor like this is useful.  This includes shooting over people's heads, at ground level and wherever your arms can reach but your head can't. I do macro in the field where this feature is invaluable. A few days ago I photographed the always crowded New York Botanical Garden train show and used the LCD monitor for most of my pictures. With the camera in P mode and forced flash I got many publication-quality pics.I like the camera's external controls a lot, especially the top and front dials. I am less enthused with the back dial which is a little awkward to operate. I have to be careful with my right hand because sometimes I touch the four-way controller, especially the manual focus button. The menu system is more modern and fancier than my Pentax and Olympus cameras but it is a bit slower. The same holds true for the autofocus which is however quite fast and accurate in low light due to the focus assist lamp. In the end, the G12 is overall much faster than the 'mythical' EVF cameras I owned in the past, including the Olympus C8080 and the Fuji S9100 which took ten seconds or more to write a Raw pic to memory (the G12 does it in two seconds). Continuous shooting is up to 2fps in best possible conditions (jpeg and fixed focus and exposure) and drops to 0.8fps with continuous focus.All the manual controls are there. The camera can shoot Raw and, my favorite, Raw + jpeg. I do all my main work in Raw but having jpegs readily available for the web and for portability is a real treat (you can check or show your jpegs with every computer). The flash is quite powerful reaching 21' at wide angle in P mode.Using the camera in automatic is as simple as it gets but learning its functions serves two purposes: it allows you to get out of trouble if you press the wrong button, and to use all that the camera can offer to the creative photographer. If all you want is a point-and-shoot, there is plenty of smaller, simpler and/or less expensive models out there.The camera offers a cornucopia of operating functions. I particularly value the live histogram before and after shooting, enlarged playback for checking focus, auto exposure bracketing up to +-2 f/stops (for out-of-camera HDR applications), spot autofocus and custom white balance. In jpeg format, I appreciate the Shadow Correct more than the Dynamic Range Correction because it does not crank up the ISO setting (= more noise). I prefer to process my Raw HDR pictures in Photoshop but I am impressed with the effectiveness of the in-camera HDR function (jpeg only). It requires the use of a tripod because the G12 cannot fine-align the three pictures it takes but with this camera you can use the lightest carbon fiber tripod on the market.Macro photography is all right with the usual limitations: the maximum magnification happens at wide angle which puts the front of the lens very close to the subject (= lighting problems). Focus bracketing is limited by the fact that is does not work in macro. It would be a killer macro feature when paired with Photoshop's extended focus function. The G12 has an exhaustive set of accessories including an AC adapter, remote release and a ring flash (there are compatible ring flash units that cost a fraction of the Canon's). The lack of a printed manual is disappointing. I immediately printed my own from the enclosed CD.I almost always work in Av mode with the autofocus set on center spot and locking, and unlocked exposure. With static subjects I like to pick my focus where I want it by pressing the shutter button half way, recompose (with the exposure continuously updating) and take the picture. With the G12 I have to pick the exposure first and lock it with the star button (top right in the back), then half press the shutter button to pick the focus point, recompose again and shoot (it takes much longer to explain it than do it). Please correct me if there is a better way to do this.In jpeg and Quick Shot mode the camera is at its fastest. The LCD monitor turns into an info screen similar to a DSLR camera, autofocus is set to continuous and you compose with the optical viewfinder.The G12 takes movies at 720p at 24fps or lower resolutions at 30fps with stereo sound but without manual controls or optical zoom. I tried and it works as intended (but I use a camcorder for video).As for the competition, the Nikon 7000 is a great camera but independent testing indicates that it is unresponsive and can be frustrating to operate. The Panasonic LX5 is also very good but has no optical viewfinder. I would have to buy and use the external electronic viewfinder which I don't like and makes the whole setup somewhat awkward.In conclusion, I find working with this camera in all the situations that do not require high speed or low light performance to be truly enjoyable. With all the limitations inherent in a compact camera, the G12 is a truly remarkable piece of photographic equipment. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to professional photographers as a go-everywhere camera as well as to serious amateurs who really want to learn the art and don't mind reading the manual.ONE YEAR LATER: after four seasons of not heavy but regular use, I would not replace the G12 with any other comparable camera on the market. There are several points that I would like to make. Shooting coastline landscapes, I have grown a real appreciation for the 16:9 format. With the LCD open to the side and facing down, I am able to lift the camera well over my head and, in specific cases, gain a crucial, higher point of view. While I am a Raw + Photoshop kind of photographer, I am always mystified by the quality of the camera's jpeg HDR function (using a very light tripod). I am also an adult educator and the pictures of my students in the classroom that I take with the flash are really good. I am looking forward to handling the very attractive G1X (not as a replacement for the G12) especially because of the excellent overall performance of the G12.""

"20110103","3.0","Good Camera but Could be Better","I know no one likes to hear a less-than-stellar review, but I have to be honest about this camera.  It's a good camera, and as long as there is plenty of light, it takes dSLR quality photos.  However, it seems anything over ISO 400 is objectionably noisy.  I can usually fix this in Lightroom, but then you lose sharpness, and re-sharpening adds back in noise of its own.  A 100% view on your photos will reveal the noise at these ISO levels.  Although I'm not usually given to pixel-peeping, it rather jumped off the screen at me in Lightroom when I offloaded my first photos from this camera.  The lens is not particularly fast, so I end up having to use higher ISO's to freeze motion and avoid camera-shake in many indoor situations.Before this, I had the G9 which was an awesome camera.  Very low noise, high resolution, it was almost hard to take a bad photo with it, but it ended up getting dust in the lens over time.  If I could have found a G9 that was in good shape and a decent price I probably would have gone that route.I gave it 3 stars because it still gives excellent quality at low ISO's and the articulated screen is really a plus and it's built like a tank.  I am still happy with my purchase, after all it's just a walkabout P&S, if I want to do serious low-light photography, I'll have to stick with my dSLR.""
"20110102","4.0","Dropped 900 mm Onto A Sidewalk.  Still Functions 100%.","PROS:The G12 slipped from my shoulder and onto a concrete sidewalk.  It bounced once.  The front plastic housing is scratched in two spots next to the flash and threaded lens adaptor ring release button. The detachable threaded lens adaptor ring was heavily scratched and the ring saved the recessed lens faceplate where it says 'Canon Zoom Lens 5X IS...' from getting scraped and damaging the lens itself.  A corner of the flip-out LCD screen was also scratched.  But, the camera is still working 100%.  This is a testament as to how rugged this camera can be.  Obviously, the higher the drop, the greater the damage.Not that it was a problem with the G11, but, the flip-out LCD screen of the G12 now snaps back into the recessed part of the rear of the camera making for a more secure latching of the screen.The flip-out LCD screen carried over from the G11 is great for awkward angled shots.Automatically preset high ISO image quality exceeds the G11.  I have never needed to use the noise reduction tool in either Canon's Digital Photo Professional or Adobe Photoshop Creative Suites 3.  Also, the 2.5 MP Low Light shooting mode yields better image quality than the G11.Video and especially audio quality has dramatically improved on the G12.  Audio distortion (though not perfect) from capturing rock concerts is a thing of the past.  But, if you are looking for optical zoom, autofocus and Exposure Compensation during video recording, this is not the camera for that.  I have the Canon PowerShot SX130 IS and it has optical zoom and, to my surprise, autofocus.  Yes, autofocus!  So, for around $300 cheaper, the SX130 IS would be the compact camera to buy for video and audio recording at concerts.  Concert venues normally will not allow videography. So, a video camcorder is out of the question.The built-in flash is mostly accurate and is sufficient for it's specified range.  Though rarely used, Flash Exposure Compensation should correct most situations and this includes macro captures.The retractable lens carried over from the G10 is sharp at all focal lengths and apertures.  If it wasn't for this lens, I would have looked elsewhere for a compact camera.The rechargeable Li-ion Battery NB-7L is good for about an hour and 30 minutes of video and still captures in a concert at normal operating temperatures.  It is recommended to buy a CE listed and labeled second battery for a 2 hour concert.  It is also recommended to buy at least one 32GB SDHC Class 10 flash card for a 2 hour concert shoot.I love the external Exposure Compensation dial.  It is there when I need to make quick adjustments.The EOS inspired front dial now makes life easier.  The LCD screen tells you when to use the front and rear dials.  So, no worries there.Finally a padded thumbrest.CONS:Surprisingly, RAW is not available in Auto, Low Light, Fish-eye, Miniature Effect and much of the other special shooting modes.The Exposure Compensation dial can be accidentally moved.  A centre button should have been installed on the dial which would require the pressing of that button before the dial can be rotated.  For your information, Canon is now retrofitting for $100 a similar button for the 5D II and 7D.The black paint on the hot shoe will scratch.  Canon should have installed a silver finished hot shoe like the one on the Canon EOS 5D Mark II.An on-the-fly video record button is sorely needed.CONCLUSION:Having owned a Canon PowerShot G10 and G11, the larger than compact G12 is the better camera for the advanced and professional user.""

"20101228","5.0","Worth the Wait","This review comes from a guy who has shot Leica M4s exclusively for past 30 years.  I have a pretty good sense of how a high quality camera should feel and perform.  I was reluctant to move away from my M4s and take the plunge into digital because the cameras in my price range offer little or no manual control over the shot. And, those that did allow me to control the shot were too bulky to take on my backpacking trips.  I'm glad I waited. The G12 feels and performs like an M4 on steriods.  While it will never replace the my Leicas, I can do all the things I love to do with my shots and if I like, I can just put it on cruise control and shoot away. I could go on-and-on about the features, but most of the other reviewers have covered them very well.  Simply put, if you want to go digital and need the performance of a professional grade camera along with the performance, feel and portability of a legend, look at the G12.""

"20101222","4.0","12th incarnation of a serious camera with an Optical Viewfinder","I would not like to repeat the accolades posted here by others, many of which I share. Let me focus on some aspects not mentioned otherwise.This is Canon's 12th generation of their G-series, refined and tuned in small steps. After the G10 disaster they came to senses and lowered the amount of megapixels in favor of a better image quality and low light performance. Good call, excellent! We also like the front modal wheel added, however in many cases its operation is limited, as if added in the last moment and and not really incorporated into the generic function of the camera.And, at the time of their release (2nd half 2010) only this camera and the Nikon P7000 (which we also have) provide both:a) an optical viewfinder,b) RAW format.Do not listen to people calling the viewfinder 'pathetic' or using any other such strong negative denotation. This is a bare nonsense. Do not compare the G12 viewfinder to the large and heavy viewfinders in cameras like the 7D or D300. Compare the viewfinder rather to any even most modern end-of-2010 EVF (Electronic Viewfinder).I am an ardent SLR (now DSLR) user, and I find the Optical Viewfinder in both G12 and P7000 adequate and a blessing. Considering the weight, size and price, both are somewhat limited, sure. But they zoom with the lens, and they allow me and my wife to photograph in full sun light. No current LCD display or an EVF comes even close to the image showed by this viewfinder. The time, or even an 'Era of EVF' might be to come, but it is not there yet. People who use darkening glasses, or any sort of glasses which might polarize light, find vast majority of modern cameras unusable in sun light. We tried the expensive Lumix/Leica with their viewfinder. It is dark like looking through a dirty glass or a curtain. Compared to such EVF's the optical viewfinders in G12 or P7000 are superior.Why? Because only an optical viewfinder passes light energy proportional to the ambient light, thus to the light to which our eyes are attuned to. Young people who never used film cameras got accustom to the photography on arms length. Not so people who used film cameras all life long! I virtually always prefer the optical viewfinder, and I place my camera close to my eye for better stability.If you do not want the viewfinder, of course the Canon S95 is a better choice. Same sensor, same RAW format, tiny size, less money.Compared to P7000: shorter lens, but boy, the Nikon is dramatically slow when used in RAW mode. Their new firmware improved this by good 40%, what shows the extend of the blunder which they have committed. Even with this improved speed the G12 outguns the P7000 by almost 3:1 in speed of raw image storage. If you do action, forget the P7000 and take the Canon! Image quality seem comparable in both cameras.When you stay with no more than ISO 800, the G12 produces very nice results, in many cases completely competitive with any older DSLR of 10Mpix resolution. Good news is that even the ISO 1600 noise can be processed to a small size image for web or printing (say 2-3Mbytes effective,) which looks great and serves its purpose. This gives a city or event photographer a greater mobility and allows to operate more inconspicuous. Should you need the larger resolution, neither the G12 nor the P7000 will win any 'low light awards.' Even the bottom level DSLR's will beat them to a pulp. Know your limitation!""
"20101221","4.0","A little surprise goes a long way...","I am absolutely in love with this camera. I am not a professional photographer but I do appreciate good, artistic pictures. I was debating between this and a DSLR since I'm attending a friend's wedding this February and want to get some good pictures to put in my wedding photography portfolio (I want to pursue this hobby on a more professional scale sometime in the future). I finally decided on this one since I will also be bringing it on our island-hopping trip as well (thinking about lugging around a big DSLR while climbing rock formations to get to the hidden lagoons just doesn't appeal to me).First impression: It IS bulkier than your regular point-and-shoot cameras.But this became quite understandable after I started playing around with the settings and options. And, whew, there are a lot of ways you can experiment with the G12! I started taking practice shots as soon as I got the memory card I ordered (Yes, it does not come with a memory card---You have to buy that separately) and was very pleased with the results. Picture quality also depends on your memory card so please read up on that as well.Now, this might sound trivial to all the professional photographers in here, but this little surprise really cinched this deal for me. The G12 has the fish-eye option *throws confetti in the air*. I really love this particular effect, especially when used in landscape shots, so when I saw it on the G12, I laughed my little heart out. I have mainly been photoshopping pictures to get the fish-eye look, but now that I have it, I'm ecstatic.I did not give it a 5 since it's really not perfect yet, but there are already a lot of reviews pointing out its cons so I'll just leave it at that. But I am still very much satisfied with this camera.""
"20101220","5.0","The Canon G12 is Great","I got this camera to use in addition to a Canon SD450 which I already have. The SD450 almost always takes excellent pictures outdoors, but has very little you can change to control the picture the camera takes. For example, when indoors, with the camera set to auto, sometimes it will take good pictures and sometimes it won't. In an area with fluorescent lighting the pictures have a distinctly different color tone, and there is basically no way to do anything to change that until after you import the pictures and try to touch them up with photo editing software. The SD450 is great if you just want to put it in your pocket in case you happen to see something you want to take a picture of, because it is very small. I wanted the G12 to take better quality pictures of friends and family, especially at family functions like reunions and holiday gatherings. The G12 also has a better lense and more zoom. It is listed as having 5X Optical Zoom, and the camera actually has the capacity to zoom in to 10X with (I presume) an interpolated zoom for the 6x to 10X portion. I was especially interested in this camera's ability to take pictures in RAW format and the ability to take 720 HD video. When I import the original pictures, I save them in a folder I name with the date or other identifier and the word  'Originals' and at the same time make another folder with the same first name and 'Reduced' to put the modified pictures into. This way, if I happen to delete or ruin a picture accidentally while trying to improve it, I can always restore a copy from the original file and start over. I then use the excellent photo program that is included to reduce the size of a copy of all the pictures I decide to keep.  (I was expecting yet another copy of the latest version of Adobe Photoshop Elements, but this camera comes with a much better Photo software package.) The SD450 seems to take a lot of pictures that have red eye, but so far I have not had that problem with the G12. This camera takes excellent pictures just by leaving it on full automatic. I am still learning how to use this camera, but so far, with just the auto settings I am very happy with the picture quality. The software has an excellent batch processing ability where you can select the pictures you want to change and it processes them all at once very quickly. This is very helpful if you send pictures to friends and family by e-mail. Canon also provides online storage of the pictures if you want, so you can just send people a invitation to the web site and they can go to the site by invitation only and look at, print or save any pictures they want.So far I am very impressed with the battery life. I charged it fully upon arrival and have used the camera several times, once almost all day and have not had to recharge the battery even once. It is getting low and I will fully charge it again after discharging it fully.Finally, I would like to say that Amazon was very helpful in getting the camera to me very quickly. I wanted to use it at an family reunion, but I actually waited too long to place the order. Somehow Amazon came through and I got the camera the day before the reunion. Thanks, Amazon!""
"20101220","5.0","Much Better!","Recently I decided to purchase a P&S to accompany my DSLR and one that my husband could use, he prefers a P&S.  At first I purchased the S95, but really was not happy with the size, controls and image quality. I returned it to Amazon and got this one instead. Others found fault with my review of the S95, insisting that I need to use the manual controls, not shoot in auto.  I use the manual controls with my DSLR, I wanted a P&S that could be left in auto so my husband would use it. He is not a techie and will not touch my DSLR.  As a previous G series owner, I knew the G series worked wonders in auto, as well as many advanced controls - the best of both worlds.  Love the size (the S95 was just too small), the duarability and the quality. My husband is very comfortable handling this camera and I look forward to using it myself. Got a good deal from Amazon and I am very happy.""
"20101219","5.0","Near perfect P & S","I spent a lot of time online comparing this camera with the canon S95, Lumix LX-5, and less so the Nikon.  I was tempted by the S95's smaller size but greater control options and better lens led me to the G12.  I was also interested in the Panasonic LX-5 but I just could not get over the Panasonic color management especially in JPEG since I'm too lazy to deal with RAW exclusively and didn't want to adjust color on all my photos, I went with the G12.  Sure, it is not that fastest, brightest, or smallest, but it is a very good compromise in a size that is somewhat pocketable (certainly in a jacket pocket and in a pinch my pant pocket).  Its speed certainly doesn't compare with DSLR level cameras but the difference with the LX-5 was not enough to sway me.  I'm not a pro but want quality photos of my family and scenaries when we travel, and I think this is a great camera for that.  I've not missed too many great shots with this camera, its low-light performance is very respectable, and its 'auto' mode is excellent.  The auto white-balance biases toward the warm side in indoor lighting so that's only the thing I'd like to go out of auto mode for.  Occassionally I use the other settings but rarely.  I'll post some of the photos taken in 'auto' to demo how good it is as a P&S while still giving people near professional-like control for lots of things.Pros against competing cameras:Flip-out screen (I know some people dismisses this but it is handy sometimes)Automatic/internal lens cover (just say no to the dangling lens cover)Good lowlight performance (yeah I know the S95 is similar and the LX-5 has better aperture but I liked the G12 performance better on head-to-head comps)5x optical zoomCons:no optical zoom on video (but this doesn't bother me on a photo camera)size/weight (it's not that bad, if I want super compact I just use my phone's camera)Conclusion:I'm very happy with my purchase.  It is a good P&S companion to people who have DSLR, and for me it's good enough to delay my DSLR purchase for now.""
"20101219","5.0","G12 for great phots","I bought this camera after using a friends G10. I have a DSLR system that I use for business, but I found I was only 'working' at photography and that I had lost some of the fun of it. Not any more. The G12 can go from turn it on and shoot to full manual with all the necessary controls. Image quality is superb. The camera is easy to use, is small with adequately sized controls, and the video quality excellent. The small basic viewfinder can be helpful when the lighting conditions make shooting with the LCD difficult. It is not designed to replace the LCD however. The built-in zoom lens (28mm - 140mm 35mm equivalent) works well for me, be some photographers may prefer a wider or longer lens. Me. I'm happy. I am shooting more personal stuff now and am experimenting with new subjects. Best of all, because of its size I always have a camera with me.""
"20101215","5.0","Best Point & Shoot Picture Quality!!","To begin, let me say that I'm not a professional photographer, nor would I consider myself a novice.  I don't shoot in RAW, and I'm not really concerned with all of the ISO settings and talk about 'noise,' etc.  I'm just an average 'Point & Shoot' kind of guy, who will occasionally use the various scene modes and adjust the flash settings - but that's the extent of my manual manipulation of the settings.Simply stated, I wanted a camera that takes beautiful pictures and records in HD.  I also wanted something that has extra bells & whistles, so if I do want learn photography, I have something good to begin with.I've had this camera for almost a month now and I am absolutely thrilled with it!  The picture quality using the Auto settings is AMAZING!  I've never had a point & shoot that took pictures this great!  The picture quality rivals that of my friends T2i.  He's a professional photographer and was amazed at the quality of the G12's pictures using auto settings...  He even ordered one for himself so he doesn't have to carry around his bulky dslr.  In my eyes, the color comes out so lifelike - What I mean by this is that the colors look exactly the way I saw them, with no noticeable variation (unlike several other Sony and Nikon cameras that I've owned in the past).  Another feature I'm really impressed with is the HD recording.  I've used it outside at night with little to moderate lighting, and I am simply impressed with the clarity and crispness of the video.  You can also see some videos yourself by going to YouTube and searching 'Canon G12 video.'So in a nutshell, this camera takes outstanding pictures and videos, and has more bells & whistles that you can use should you ever want them.  I researched several cameras and narrowed it down to the G12 and Nikon Coolpix 7000.  I really considered the Nikon Coolpix P7000, but then read a lot of negative reviews here on Amazon regarding the reliability of the device itself.  Several people reported all kinds of problems (not to mention slow RAW image processing, but that doesn't matter to me)...  And when you spend this much money for a camera, it had better be reliable!""
"20101215","5.0","Great point and shoot with DXO support!!!","I have just bought the Canon Powershot G12 and can say that the image quality in RAW format with DXO post processing is totally AWESOME!!!  JPEG image quality isn't that good and shows much of the overcompression that the SX130IS has (JPEG filesize is about 1/8 that of RAW filesize).  You can read the positive reviews of the G12 for why it's a great point and shoot, but so far my main gripes are that the Auto ISO even with flash defaults to 500 and has tons of color noise, which can only be cleaned up so well in post processing with RAW noise reduction, so if you have enough light, leave it at ISO 80 if at all possible (seems obvious, but my DSLR 30D handles high ISO better in terms of noise).  Also, the default RAW aspect ratio is locked at 4:3 and cannot be set to 3:2 (only works for JPEG), so there will be a lot of manual cropping needed before printing 4x6 images.  Otherwise, provided you post process the G12 RAW files in DXO to remove lens distortion, chromatic aberration / fringing, vignetting, etc., the G12 is a FANTASTIC point and shoot.  I use Photoshop for levels, color correction, sharpening, cropping, etc.  Honestly, I may never buy another point and shoot again that is not supported in DXO.  The difference is 100% night and day.  At last for those longer excursions when saving your shoulder / back / neck is more important than high quality DSLR images, no more bulk!!!""
"20101209","5.0","Definite improvement over G10","My G10 was used for underwater photography and whenever it was inconvenient to use my 1DSMark III or 5DMark II.  But the G10 is very noisy. The G12 noise control is much improved in the RAW mode and is even better in JPG.  The pivoting view screen is great for creative viewpoints. The only downside is that the post imaging processing time is a little slow so you can't shoot rapidly in full resolution mode.  I am comfortable enough with the G12 to use it in place of my DSLRs whenever I need to be less noticeable as a photographer or when I know the final image won't need to be extremely large.""

"20101207","1.0","Canon G12 Problem","I will be posting a video for this camera on Youtube  as well showing the problem before I ship it back to Canon.I bought it a month ago brand new. Before that I have used the same 2004 Kodak DX7630 since I bought it in 2004. With that camera,I have shot thousands of photos of my art for Ebay and I have made hundreds of videos for Youtube and it has never let me down. I thought however it was time for an upgrade.I have no need for much of what these cameras functions offer. It was very hard just trying to find a camera in this class that was not loaded down with a bunch of garbage I would never use and that would eventually cause the camera to malfunction. I just need good image quality for photographing art and simple video function. I researched the latest digital cameras and decided I could do all I needed and maybe a bit more with the G12.I could go on and on about this, but basically I was impressed with the cameras image quality when I can get the settings right, there are too many bells and whistles and settings and options, maybe that is a good thing, but it takes a while to get it all down.THE PROBLEM. I started noticing when I was reviewing the photos I took, after skipping past the last photo the camera would just freeze, not power down, just freeze. I would then have to power the camera back up. It does everytime now. This is a problem when you are shooting art and trying to review it and you have your settings and lights and all that set up and you have to keep turning the camera back on and reset everything. I have also shot some video, that looks just terrible, nowhere near as good as my old Kodak. But I really have not had a chance to use this camera since it started malfunctioning.So here is the problem, whenever you buy something new that just came out, you are most likely also paying to be the companies free Product Tester. Canon said they have not experienced this problem yet and I am now having to pay a little more to send it back so they can see what their free Product Tester has discovered.The thing is, you pay 500 bucks for something it should work. Now I have to think whenever a photo doesn't look right or a video looks odd was it me the photographer or is it the camera?Is something else going to go wrong with this camera that has not even lasted a month?This is why I never buy anything that just came out....I messed up, oh well, at least I still have my old trusty Kodak, off to Canon Repairs this G12 goes!I wish I could give this camera 5 stars, but because it has not even lasted a month and I am having to send it back so they can see whats wrong, well if there was a no star rating that's what my experience with this Canon G12 would be because I have not even had a chance to really use it.Don't get me wrong here it's not just Canon, it is all products these days just about especially electronic products. They are mass produced and quality falls short over quantity.I just wish I had no sold my old Hasselblad to get this camera.""
"20101205","5.0","A great camera for those who don't want to lug their pro gear everywhere","I'm a wedding photographer that normally shoots with 5D Mk II's. I got the G12 to carry with me at all times for personal and business trips. As much as I love the quality of my DSLR, it's extremely heavy to carry around my purse even if I take off the battery grip and only bring one lens. So I picked up the G12 for personal use when I'm not off shooting a gig.I love the quality of the pictures on this camera, and it's extremely good at capturing images without the flash. The built in flash works decently too, and it's a great added bonus to have the hot shoe on there if I want to throw my 580 EX II's on it.The 720p video mode is definitely a great and fun feature of this camera. I usually shoot in RAW mode, but I won't lie, occasionally I switch to the 'miniature mode' to get a pretend looking tilt shift lens style effect.The menu has been very intuitive and I haven't had any problems finding features without referencing the manual first. The dial controls on the camera are great for always being able to quickly see the mode, iso, exposure, etc. I love the flip and rotate lcd screen, back in 2005 I owned a Canon Powershot Pro1 which also had a flip and rotate LCD that I loved, so great to see they're still doing these in the new cameras too.While it seems nice to have an optical viewfinder, to be honest, I don't actually use it at all.So in summary this is a great camera, packs a lot of features and quality into a very sturdy body. You won't be disappointed!""
"20101203","5.0","A THING OF BEAUTY","I just received my copy of the G12.  And it is a thing of beauty.  I would be content to own this camera and not take any pictures with it.  I know that some reviewers have found fault with it because it is not sufficiently upgraded from previous models.  Since I didn't own the G10 or G11 this was not an issue.  The camera feels good in my medium size hands but it could be slightly larger and the controls are well placed.  The optical viewfinder is better than I had imagined.  This especialy pleased me because I'll be using it more than the LCD screen.  I like the flip out screen more than I had thought because you can flip it around to protect the screen from finger prints and nose grease. The 60D has this feature too.  Shutter lag is not a problem as it is in most compacts.  The photos are bright and contrasty and compare with higher end DSLR pics.  All in all, it's a great camera to own and use when you don't want to lug around your DSLR.""
"20101202","5.0","Fantastic Camera","I have been learning and using my new camera for a 24 hours and I am in love! I have previously owned a Canon SX110IS and a SX120IS. I loved my SX110IS! It took great pictures and was super easy to use. However, I dropped it and the screen cracked. Using the insurance I received the SX120IS as a replacement. All the pictures it took were soft and I know why but it doesn't pertain to this review. It was very frustrating and after nearly a year of use, I couldn't deal with it anymore! I debated about switching to another brand of camera after my experience but I'm so glad I didn't.The camera feels so good in my hands. It is very well constructed. My other camera had manual capabilities as well and it really helped prepare me for using this camera. I debated about purchasing a DSLR but after examining my needs I decided it was too much for me. This camera is about the same size as my others so I am comfortable with it. It's got some weight to it, though I'm sure not as much as DSLR.It takes amazing pictures and I haven't had a soft one yet!Unfortunately, now it has to go back in the box until Christmas so I will update my review in the new year.""

It suddenly stopped working with no warning.When I researched the problem on the internet I discovered this was a very common complaint.Type 'My Cannon G9 just died' into Google to see what I mean.Apparently Cannon don't bother to use fixing glue for the internal screws.So eventually one is likely to shake free and short circuit the camera.When asked about this a Cannon spokesperson apparently said that '2 years is a reasonable lifespan for a modern digital camera'.If like me you would prefer your camera to last a little longer than that I suggest you check out another brand.

I like the 'portability' of this camera because bottom line, I do not want to haul around a DSLR. It's simply too bulky and heavy. For most non protographer shooters, this camera is more than excellent in its performance.The construction is tight, the function rich and when u want to turn it into a P and S, just set it to AUTO. On the other hand, u want it to do more, u have manual controls to set to your desire.There are some things I miss about this camera. I do wish they kept the time lapse feature, but my biggest gripe is not the camera, but the fact that Canon decided to cut cost on the owner manual. U can either download it from their site or get it on the CD, but come on, at $500, they can afford to give us an owners manual, so we don't have to view it on the computer screen, or print out 214 pages from our printer. When printed, u have 214 pages of loose 8.5 x11 paper to contend with.If they included the owner's manual, I would have given it all 5 stars. I would take 1/2 star if I could, but since it won't let u, then 4 stars then.Like I said, it's a great camera, and I strongly recommend it to everyone.

"20101125","5.0","I Simply Love This Camera","First off, I am not a professional photographer, but more of an advanced novice.  Last year I bought a Canon SLR Xsi and thought it was the best thing ever.  The pictures are awesome and I was very happy with it.  The problem I ran into was its so darn big.  So I left it at home most of the time and dragged along a cheap point and shoot just because I did not want to deal with the extra luggage associated with an SLR.  I started researching the high end point and shoot cameras as a compromise.  It came down to the G12 and the Nikon P7000.  I am somewhat of a Canon purist and ended up with the G12.  Man am I happy with this camera.  It does exactly what I expected.The build quality of this camera is great.  It feels comfortable in my hand and does not at all feel cheep.  It's a bit on the large size as compared to a point and shoot, but it is much smaller than a SLR, so I am very happy about that.  The overall picture quality is impressive.  Its actually a bit better than I expected.  I do not have the trained eye of a professional, but I would rate it close to what my Xsi was producing.  Not quite as good, but close.  The ability to access most of the important functions via dials on the camera has opened up a whole new world for me.  No more chasing down ISO and exposure in the menus.  The camera has a front dial that is customizable also.  It also has a TON of built in features that I wont review, but it is more than I have ever seen on a camera.  Several of the reviews of the video aspects of this camera did scare me, but it is a camera for gods sake and not a camcorder.  From what I can tell so far, the video is just fine, but limited.At the end of the day, this is a slight downgrade from my Xsi, but it is something that will definitively get a ton of use due to it being smaller than a SLR.  If you are looking for a high quality point and shoot and don't mind a bit of bulk, get this camera.  If you need something to supplement a SLR setup, get this camera.""

"20101121","5.0","Love It, Love It, Love It -- the Canon G12","Received some new grant money for my photography, but knew it would take me forever to save up enough for even an entry-level DSLR (think: NYC starving artist who's been in some 15+ gallery shows in less than three years, and published nationally and internationally, using first just a webcam and then an inexpensive point and shoot).  Then, miraculously, both Nikon and Canon released in September and October, respectively, a new top of the line 'point and shoot', but in reality it's really a hybrid P&S/DSLR.  I researched endlessly, reading reviews of every nature comparing, head to head, the Nikon Coolpix (i hate that name, to start with) P7000 versus the Canon Powershot (better, i guess I'd rather have 'power' than be 'cool' and the 'pix' part is just childish sounding) G12.  The reviews and reviewers were pretty much split down the middle, about half saying 'yea, Nikon!' and the other half saying 'yea, Canon'.Even though the Nikon is about $50 less expensive and every penny counts to me, there finally was a decision for the Canon G12 and I'm very, very happy so far.  What i wanted most as a photographer is present in both cameras -- namely the ability to shoot in RAW.  The Canon felt, in its make and heft (I wanted a camera that didn't look like a throwaway) looks more like a serious camera than the Nikon.  And the Canon G12 has an adjustable tilt LCD which matters to me as I'm in any number of my photos (the Nikon's screen is fixed).I didn't care that the Nikon has a bigger zoom (my work is more structured/theatrical and story-oriented, and when I'm shooting for gallery work, I don't really zoon).  I laugh aloud at the quibblers who are all over Canon, berating Canon for only having a 2.8' screen, rather than a 3' screen (get real, people, that's just silly....)  My biggest concern with the Nikon was that many reviewers were saying that the shots come slowly when shooting in RAW.  I don't know if that's true or not.  I made sure I got the fastest best memory card that's made for the Canon, and it's feeling very responsive.I'm sure the Nikon is a swell camera; it just comes down to the minute features that matter to you most.  Bottom line is they both shoot in RAW without having to juryrig your Canon with CHDK (which worked very well on a Canon Powershot I had that's now no longer made).  I hated that Canon couldn't have coughed up the expense of including a real manual (you get to download it to your computer and then print out 275 pages), but maybe Nikon doesn't do that either.  You get past it.  I was doing just fine simply using some creativity with a webcam and then a P&S -- sometimes having less money makes you actually think and create, rather than be obsessed about buttons and gadgets.  That said, I'm really thrilled that both Canon and Nikon have created something reachable (you know your income bracket when the photo magazines and blogs call a $1000 DLSR a 'backup' camera to have around, just because.Anyway, I love my Canon G12 so far, and there's no indication I won't continue to love it.  Plus Canon is coming out with a nifty leather case for it (that's next month's purchase, if it's in the States yet).""
"20101121","5.0","Just what I ws looking for","I have had this Camera for a few weeks and want to share my findings in this review.I shoot with Canon DSLR's like the 50D and 5D MkII and needed something pocketable with enough manual control plus a lot of electronic wizardy when I didn't have time to set up a shot.This camera fills all those needs.1. Easy to carry in a coat pocket and very light compared to any interchangeable lens camera2. Excellent Image Quality (IQ)at ISO 80, 100 and 200, reasonable upto even 800 for small prints3. Seems quite well built, and has reasonable control through 5 dials (total) on the outside.4. Much more depth of field (DOF)than an APS-C of Full Frame sensor, this helps tremendously for just about everything other than artsy portraits where shallow DOF may be desirable. Great for Macros, Landscape etc. where it is a struggle with larger sensors to get the right DOF.5. Fast startup time, and response to inputs.6. JPegs are very very good compared to the time and effort to process RAW files and get just a little more of anything, at all, as compared to high end DSLR's where the opposite is true.7. 720p HD movies. You can't change focus during recording, but this isn't a movie camera, get a dedicated one if you are really wanting to shoot movies, but in a pinch, this works for landscapes and anything else where you aren't focussing a moving objects and looking for a shallow DOF. Even DSLR's like Sony's A55 etc make compromises in order to get focussing when shooting movies.8. Someone here critized the frame rate/speed of this camera. Well, it is only 1 frame per second slower than a 5D MKII that costs 5 times as much without a lens! I would never use this to shoot sports or birds in flight, no kidding.9. The movable LCD screen is a real plus, lots and lots of uses for this, and flipping it over protects the screen, a big plus.10. F2.8 lens, instead of a faster lens. I would take a better quality F2.8, (still a fast lens, fast enough for Pros) than a much larger F2.0 lens, if it lowers Image Quality in any way. At ISO 100, the portrait detail is almost as good as a DSLR and lens costing atleast twice as much, if not much, much more.11. The Hybrid IS is great, have not had a single Out of Focus shot, even a slow as 1/15th of a second, and I'm old!12. I'm adding a 270EX flash for more range and to save the camers batteries. Very cute pair.13. I'm getting the FA(?) lens filter attachment, so I can use a polarizer filter, and so I can put on a lens cap to protect the filter. This moves in and out with the lens and avoids vignetting, and will be great in protecting the lens with a replaceable filter and keeping the lens free of dust.Very few negatives, since you really should not be comparing this to a DSLR. If you must have a DSLR, get a Canon XS for about the same money, which then has its own limitations.Is this a pro camera? NO. Its a great back up camera for a pro, who wants to travel light and stealthy, and get 80% of the shots.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update after 4 weeks of extensive use:Like:1. Very fast response and great handling2. Shot about 8 GB (~600 pics +25 short video clips), and only less than 10 pictures and 1 video were out of focus.3. The Canon FA-DC58B filter adapter held up well,and kept dust away from the lens. Used polarizers effectively with no vignetting.4. The Lowepro 100 AW soft case worked well with the camera + lens adapter, and I was able to keep an 8GB card, spare battery and filter in a small, weather tight unobtrusive package that didn't invite unwanted attention, like a SLR would when travelling and with customs.5. Once I got used to switching modes, flash on-off, video to pictures, low-light mode, all in a jiffy, I was really getting a lot of great shots and videos. I doubt if I would have been able to do all this with my DSLR without an assistant!6. The low light mode with IS is incredible. The noise is easily removed with software like Topaz Denoise, and the end results are good enough for the web and small prints.Dislike:1. Not much, other than keep your fingers away from the flash, and thats user error!All in all, unless I needed the highest quality for landscapes of studio work, this camera does the trick, with a lot less stress!""
"20101118","4.0","Good camera but not great","I bought the G12 as a camera to take to my daughters school events, B-day parties and family get togethers. I own a couple Canon DSLR cameras including the 5D Mark II and an assortment of L-series lenses. I love my 5D. I'm used to it's tack sharp images with nice contrast and color. This is not what I'm getting with the G12. I realize this is like comparing apples to oranges but only mention it to establish the fact that I know good image quality when I see it. The G12 images are okay but definately not as sharp as I'm used to. Also the images are very noisey especially at 400 ISO and higher. Additionaly, the camera's light meter is good but not great. It tends to over expose quite often. I do think the easy access manual controls, fully articulating back screen, optical viewfinder, relatively small size and ability to shoot RAW images is great and are the reasons why I purchased the camera. The camera is feature rich for it's size. However, it suffers where it matters the most - image quality. I have not viewed the video on my computer or t.v. so can not comment on the quality. I can say that the video I took did look good on the camera's small screen. To be fair, I have to admit, I am very picky when it comes to image quality. For every day snapshots I think this camera will do fine and so I give it 4 stars.""
"20101114","5.0","Unbelievable point and shoot camera......","I have been into photography for well over 40 years, amateur and professionally.  During that time I've owned all of the majour brands of cameras, both film and digital.  After digital came along I've owned 3 Olympus DSLR'S, 1 Nikon point and shoot, i.e., S550, and now the Canon G12.  I must admit that my professional days are long gone and the majority of my photography is either macro of plant, flowers, bugs, etc. and during travel.  I also own a pro-sumer Panasonic video camera as well.  One thing I have always regretted is having to lug heavy bulky camera equipment around.  Owning my first point and shoot camera several years ago, the Nikon S550 really opened my eyes to the utility and convenience of a small well made camera.  After reading about the latest point and shoot options I settled on the Canon G12.  I still can't believe what they pack into such a small piece of kit!The stills and 720i HD video (with stereo sound) that this Canon G12 is remarkable to me.  I read one of the '1 star' reviews and totally DO NOT AGREE.  It continually amazes me why consumers denigrate a product when they can read, I assume, what they are buying.  I would much rather own a single camera with minor compromises than decide not to carry a camera (stills or video) and miss a great shot.  One thing I believe is that many consumers are convinced that the large, heavy, and bulky 'pro' cams have got to be better, if not the best.  Those huge pro lens are totally unnecessary with digital sensors vs. film.  The only reason that those huge lens were necessary was that film required much more light gathering capacity.  That is why the four thirds system was invented.  All the majour companies have done is basically convert their 35mm cameras to digital.It took me a long time to convince myself of the above reality.  The features of my new Canon G12 would serve perfectly almost any average consumer, pro and/or otherwise, unless you're more into 'conspicuous consumption' than a reasonably priced feature packed camera that you can take virtually anywhere and shoot either great stills and/or videos.  The photo software that comes with the camera is also stellar, as is the plethora of accessories offered. They even offer an underwater enclosure if your into diving.  The only thing that I'm am curious about is why they included an optical view finder?  That's not a criticism, it just seems a bit out of place? I just can't say enough about this jewel.""

"20101112","2.0","Watch Out!!!","Cons:Faulty audio in zoom, Faulty viewfinder, Lack of printed manual, Movie zoom in digitalBest Uses:Good 'pocket' still camBottom Line:No, I would not recommend this to a friendFirst let me state that the 2-star rating is due to the camera's movie capabilities. For the stills, though havent tried all the settings, I am very satisfied. Also find fault with the viewfinder.Here are my reasons:When shooting a movie and using the zoom feature the camera's audio picks up whirring and clicking sounds (from the motor). Also the zoom(while in movie mode) is digital zoom not optical and the user has no control over this.When I noticed this I called Canon and was told that this was 'not acceptable' and the camera I had was faulty. So I exchanged for another one.The other camera (still a G12) arrived and it exhibited the same noise problem. Called Canon again and after speaking to several reps finally was reffered to page 30 of the users manual.To quote: 'Pressing the zoom lever will zoom in on the subject. However,operation sounds will be recorded and the movie may appear coarse'Translation: You'll get whirring and clicking sounds in your audio and the camera records at digital zoom.True I could go in and delete the audio portion of the video but if I had recorded other sounds this would be a daunting task.As for the viewfinder: It does not display any settings but they are displayed in the LCD. Thus if one wants to use the viewfinder and adjust or check settings, one has to constantly move the camera from the viewfinder to the LCD,etc. In effect why bother having a viewfinder?Another gripe I have is Canon not including a printed user manual and their lame excuse about 'green movement.' I guess all the Canon executives carry around an 8x10 manual at a couple pounds. Or perhaps they have memorized it? Shame on you Canon, if you want to save money cut some of the useless 'features.'So, if you can live with the above, I still think it takes great pictures.""
"20101110","4.0","Great Camera (I've never given anything 5 stars)","I compared the G12 endlessly to other similar cameras, especially Nikon P7000, Canon S95, Lumix LX5.I troubled about the 2.8 vs. 2.0 lens, and the shorter zoom range, and lack of zoom during video.Two things finally swayed me:  1. Confidence in Canon G-line - they've been the most popular compact among pro photographers for a long time.  2. The articulating display.So far, I am happy with my decision.I assume Canon went with the 2.8 because they'd rather clip the aperture than suffer any quality loss. I know they are aware that everything else being equal, we'd all prefer 2.0 over 2.8. I'm guessing they wouldn't have been able to make everything else be equal while pushing the max aperture to 2.0. The quality at 2.8 is excellent.Likewise, I assume they drew the limit zoom-wise to maximize performance in the range that is supported. The quality at 95mm max zoom (35mm equivalent) is excellent.I consider the articulating display a must have feature. I know some people think its gimmicky, but for me it just changes everything about the usability of the camera. I could go on and on, but I'll try and be brief: you can take pictures of the underside of mushrooms on a muddy forest floor without getting muddy; you can take pictures discreetly without holding a camera to your face; you can hold the camera high in the air or around a corner and snap; you can take pictures of yourself...Yes, its bulkier than the S95, but thats a tradeoff that seems worthwhile to me - I have a small lumix if I need to put a camera in my pant pocket with less bulge...Anyway, I just found out the Lumix shoots AVCHD video which Lightroom does not support, so I would have been out in the cold there, since I have a Lightroom-centric workflow.The biggest downside compared to the Lumix is you can't zoom while shooting video on the G12 like you can with the Lumix. - Big bummer if you shoot much video with it. Luckily for me I have an older Canon S5 that zooms whilst video-ing, granted its standard def, but thats not a big deal to me.Another peeve is the on/off push-button is easily pressed and whenever pressed tries to extend the lens. Thus if you carry in a pocket or small bag you run the risk of having it turn on and damage the lens extension mechanism - drives me crazy.Another thing I wish the flash could extend more - you can't take macros very close with popup flash supplementation without the lens blocking the light from the flash.I will say I had fairly low expectations image-quality-wise due to the small sensor of all compacts, but I was very pleasantly surprised! The image quality at ISO 80-100 rivals my Nikon D300 at ISO200, and the image quality at ISO800 is very usable (with noise reduction provided by Lightroom), unlike my Canon S5 that looks atrocious at ISO800.The lens is very sharp with surprisingly little chromatic aberration, most of which is nicely corrected by Lightroom. Likewise, wide angle distortion is nicely corrected by Lightroom.The exposure compensation and ISO dials right on body are a godsend. In my opinion, no camera manufacture has invented a really slick UI yet, and Canon is no exception. But, if you're a manual-ISO-a-holic like me its really cool having that adjustment so handy. Ditto for exposure comp.Other downside: There are three little LEDs forever lit up, that don't really help enough to be able to make adjustments in the dark, but make the camera forever visible. I wish there was a stealth mode that would not only silence the camera, but deep-6 the leds too.""

"20101107","4.0","Plan ahead for Awesome Imaging!","A quasi-pocketable digital is my preference and I do not want a DSLR because I still use my film SLR as needed. I'm an advanced hobbyist/sometime semi-pro shooter. I've been using my venerable Canon S50 but it finally croaked because I beat the tar out of it!For the last few years I've been pondering a new camera but nothing has seemed quite right. Almost popped for the G11 but the little voice inside said 'wait...' but I can wait no more. I went to the PDN show in NYC and finally held the G12 and the S95 and the choice was clear to me. Go big or go home!Some aspects of the G12 are becoming obvious: Quick auto point'n shoots in daylight look absolutely great and I'd defy anyone to tell the diff between this and a pro SLR in many cases. Low light shooting is also impressive using the various modes and it seems like there is always some hidden new feature to discover. There's tons of logic in this camera but it definitely takes getting used to (to be able to switch quickly between some feature-buried modes) like any complicated new toy.I never needed an external exposure lock button or an exposure compensation dial (which seems to me to be a holdover from film SLRs and I never used EC anyway)...I do all that with metering, but suppose some folks like it so OK. More buttons = more opportunity for moisture or dirt contamination. I will learn how to use the servo-tracking effectively someday. I'm slowly learning how to utilize the finer points of the G12 by actually reading the manual and as a result I've gotten some impressive shots I'd never have grabbed with my older digital.The two user-programmable custom settings are growing on me and if you put your favorite 'scene' mode in place it's more like three customizable settings are there. Like with any computer, the average user probably uses only about 2% of the total logic available so it's good to be able to program, say, 'film' and 'B&W' features into the C1 and C2 settings for quick use. I also like slow shutter with first-curtain flash which I do not need to customize, just dial over to the Tv setting and leave a slow speed on it. By the way, Canon, I've never warmed up to your Av/Tv dial settings: its aperature priority (A) and shutter priority (S). So there.To date I do not see much difference between auto setting shots and the non-adjustable-effect (color) 'film' mode, which the manual says mimics a film look. Too bad--I loved grainy color-neg emulsions and miss using them. I miss pushing 400 to 1000 and underexposing a tad. I miss using polarizers also, for that matter. I do use my beloved Pentax Super Program every so often but alas, results are so much more predictable digitally. The 'nostalgic' feature in 'scene' mode, dialed all the way down, gives you nice, grainy b&w effects which are not as sharp as shots in the B&W mode. I like that feature a lot and wish I could get the same effects in color.(I am not much interested in post-production fiddling around with RAW or Photoshop--that is too much like work to me and can burn up hours. I'd rather get it right the first time, or get the exposure as close as possible to 'correct' when I shoot and do only minor color/contrast corrections later. All the moaning about the video shortcomings are probably accurate but I very rarely shoot video.)I can stick my new Canon G12 in my pouch or sling it around my neck easily. The camera is agreeably light but still has enough heft to steady yourself. Nicely grabbable and so far I haven't hit the wrong buttons.I like and need the optical viewfinder even if there is some lens intrusion at wide settings, but so what, it's not for final composition and only about 75% accurate anyway. I did some nature shots and it was good to be able to use the left eye 'real time' in tandem with the OV with the right.Wish list: lens-wise, a bit wider and a bit faster, like the S95. I would very much desire grainy, adjustable pushed-film-mimicing effects in color and virtual red filters for B&W, or some way to adjust the B&W sharpness up or down.The upshot: this is an expensive camera but for us photo type-A control freaks who need to shoot 'out of the box', this thing will rise to the occasion and can also teach us a thing or three if our minds are open to it. The sting of the credit card bill will ease over time as we find we are happy using the G12.""
"20101105","5.0","Excellent purchase","Having used the G3 as a workhorse supplement to my DSLRs I kept holding off on the newer G series cameras. The ability to shoot HD video and smaller size finally won me over.The camera is solid and easy to use. I'd like a couple of minor tweaks in terms of use, but the shutter response is fast and the exposures are well balanced. It is larger than most compact digital cameras, but the ones I've used are challenged to make prints 20x30 or larger (focus and optical quality being the primary issue). The G3 (at 4 MP) can take very good 16x20s, and 20x30s at lower ISO settings on the G12 are fantastic.One other note - the first camera shipped to me by Amazon was lost/stolen in the mail. While I was stunned that they shipped a $[...] product without requiring a signature (the threshold is $700), they (Amazon) were fantastic. They immediately shipped a replacement camera and even expedited the shipping.""
"20101105","5.0","Most impressive!","As I'm an old film guy who has resisted digital photography almost as much as dentist visits, I've really avoided making the jump.  Of course, I've had a few small point and shoot cameras for quick snapshots.  But recently, I've found it necessary to get a camera with more capabilities and quality.I'd love to have a higher-end DSLR, but flying these days really doesn't lend itself to lugging a big camera bag with a couple of lenses, flash, etc.  I gripe just taking my shoes off at the security checkpoint.  And I am avoiding paying checked bag fees as much as I possibly can!Last April, I finally decided to get something a bit nicer, and after weeks of searching through review after review, I finally settled on a Fuji HS10.  At first, I loved that camera.  Then, I discovered that particular unit was eating batteries with the voracity of John Pinette at a Vegas buffet.  So, back it went.  And I waited and continued to research.Then, along comes Canon with this G12.  Remember, I'm an old film guy, so I like some controls.  But after 5 minutes playing with this camera, I was most impressed.  Startup - it's ready to go in a flash.  Focus - spot on for 99% of the photos I've shot (nothing's perfect), and that 1% I can peg on me for focus issues.  Low light?  Simply amazing!  This camera's ability to compensate for low light is borderline spooky.  Combined with the lens image stabilization, I've taken shots that would have required a tripod, cable release, and good old-fashioned luck with a film camera.Sports mode is very good.  While the 'rapid-fire' shots aren't blazing fast, they are sharp, clean, and quick to save.  In fact, the camera is fast with saves in most every mode I've tried.  And speaking of modes, I discovered one that I've fallen in love with - Nostalgia mode.  With a quick click of the front-mounted scroll-wheel, one can age a photo making it appear a bit washed out and grainy.  For artistic shots, this mode just made me feel like I was working darkroom magic without the darkroom!Some folks have complained that it's too big for a pocket.  I didn't really have any issues with that.  In fact, I think that for everything this camera can do, it's size is one of the biggest selling points.I just returned from a quick trip to Jamaica where I took all sorts of shots.  The ones that got the most compliments were the low-light shots.  And everyone that asked and showed this camera were amazed at what it was able to do.As I mentioned - I'm incredibly impressed with this camera.""
"20101104","1.0","Wait for the G12a","I could not wait to get this camera and when I did I was so excited, until I started using it.Outdoors and in bright light it is awesome. Now start to work with some lower light and here is where it's flaws shine.When taking video in low light with I would get blue lines on the screen, this was ok except the record on the movie. I called Canon and they could not repro the problem. So I took the camera and exchanged it, the second one I got did the exact same thing. Blue lines from top to bottom. I search the internet to find out if anyone else was having the problem. It's called vertical smear and is a problem with CCD sensors. however you can make the problem go away by turning down the exposure. Now only if the G12 would allow you to do that, then you could solve the problem, video mode is Auto only.Next problem, is you can not write to RAW in Auto modeI wanted to use the camera and work with studio flash, I set the camera to M, turn off the built in flash, set the shutter speed to 1/200 and f8 so far so good, put the pocket wizard on to trigger my strobes press the shutter and the screen goes black. So I am thinking it is a problem with the pocket wizard. It is a problem in that the LCD shows a preview of what the photo will look like, since the photo is too dark without a flash, the screen goes black, so now you can't see what you are focusing on.I thought the camera was targeted towards pros. So why Auto only video mode? What can't you preview with a an external flash, why no raw in auto? Hopefully firmware will resolve some of these issues in the meantime, I returned the second one and will wait for an update. For $500 it's too buggy for me and will wait, however if you plan to shoot mostly outdoor and bright lit scenes you will love it.""

"20101102","5.0","Much bigger than compact but much better quality than compacts","I bought Powershot G6 Long time back (2005) and was very much satisfied with it, but my wife always gripped at its big size compared to all the super compact cameras that our friends used to carry in their pockets/purses. So we shopped around and bought the super small cannon SD780 last year which also took 720P video. Guess what, we never were able to take the pictures of our kids while they were playing. the images were always blurry. The still images indoors/outdoors were pretty good though but nowhere comparable to G7. My wife kept complaining that I didn't know how to take pictures. We finally sold that away and bought Sony HX5V, this one had 10x zoom and some very good features. But the pictures just didn't compare to the G7 in auto mode and there was no full manual mode on the SONY. Returned that away and bought another ultra compact. this time it was cannon Sx210IS. This had even longer zoom, 14x. but I still couldn't get the pictures of moving objects and people and they were always blurry or pathetic at best. Still pictures were no issue but no comparison to the G7 again. And I missed the manual mode here too.Tired of Ultra compacts that only look good while tucking them away in pockets/purses, I finally convinced my wife that small compacts are not our forte as we were used to taking nice pictures effortlessly and with some great quality and the only way to go was for a bigger expensive camera. I owned and Olympic IS3-DLX SLR which was a beast, before buying G7 several years ago. So we finally bought the G12 from Amazon, knowing that if we didn't like we can return it like the others.And WOW, what a difference in the picture quality compared to those ultra compacts. I am not a professional nor at best an amateur photographer for that matter, but I do dabble with manual settings and it is so easy with these G series cameras and love their swivel screen. The cameras that I bought earlier before buying G12 are no where near comparison to this one in terms of features or price, but still, for someone who might think that ultra compacts/ultra zooms are the way to go for P&S. Give this a try and you won't go wrong except for the size. The zoom while taking video is some concern but its OK. the picture quality overtakes everything else.(My review is not a comparison of similar cameras nor a suggestion to buy this camera, there may be better cameras out there. This one just happens to be my choice for only one reason. I am used to the swivel screen that G7 too had. If you have used that then this is the camera to pick).""
"20101101","4.0","Canon G12","The camera takes great pictures.  I like the fact that you can adjust the ISO on the fly.  It is very light and easier than carrying a bulky DSLR.  I chose this camera because of the 2.8 inch Vari-Angle LCD.  The only thing that is frustrating is that the manual comes on CD.  You have to print it to figure out some extra features, that is why I gave the G12 4 stars.  Night shots come out really clean.  I look forward to enjoying this camera.""

Obviously you have to know what your doing, but I have used the g9, g10-11 and now 12 for weddings and I have sold prints from all of the g series bodies, but with the lowering of the pixels and larger sensors of g11 and g 12, the g12 can perform as well as my 2500$ d700 and 5d mk ii bodies. This camera is incredible and for the price, its a professional backup and the best camera you can purchase for the price. Shooting in raw, adding 720p 24fps video and lowering pixels from 14.7 to 10mp was a huge plus. It's not always about mega pixels, take the NIKON d700 full frame 12mp is far superior than my Canon 7d at 18mp.....and sometimes better than my 22mp Canon 5d mk ii. The canon g12 has professional features, great image quality, amazing video quality and is just an overall compact incredible camera that can be used for just about anything you can think of. Seriously if have rated this camera 1 star and are complaining about the new hdr, video and screen size additions, you are a moron and clearly have no idea what you are talking about and probably couldn't take a decent photograph with a freaking NIKON d3x. I can't stand when people just give bad reviews for no reason or because they are terrible photographers or because they can't use the camera and blame they blame it for their mistakes. The Canon g12 is an excellent camera and you may not need it over the g11, but the new features and the price are well worth an upgrade or first time purchase. I would recommend this camera to anyone and do not listen to the bad reviews. Those people have no idea what they are talking about, yes the hdr feature is a gimmick, for bracketing does the same thing and using photomatix, etc....but its still a cool feature for noobs and the 720 p video is very good for the price and the ISO range, color, and lens is pro comparable if used correctly. The best feature in the g series is the hotshoe that does alloy for a pro flash like a 580ex ii to make it a great back up camera for weddings or fashion shoots. You will not regret buying any g series camera, but especially not the g12.....its a must have!""

For anything up to 11x14 prints they all fit the bill nicely.Of course for high end work, it's the 5D Mark II or the Panasonic.  I just tested the G-12 against the Panasonic for video capability.  The Panasonic has two distinct advantages.  Power zoom while shooting and the ability to use an external microphone with wind screen (Dead Cat).  But we are talking apples and pears.  You don't carry a large vid-cam on your belt.I spent a few hours on the Virginia & Truckee Railway out of Carson City, NV.  (Side note-- a great steam train ride)  I shot with the G-12 and the Panasonic Professional AG-HMC40 AVCHD Camcorder with 10.6MP Still and 12x Optical Zoom.  I planned to use the video to create a DVD of the ride. On the finished DVD if is not possible to tell the difference in the video shot with which camera.  However, there is objectionable wind noise with the G-12 when shooting into the wind. But that's a given that any videographer already knows will happen with an unprotected microphone.Five stars for the G-12.  It does a great job for stills and video.

"20101024","5.0","Very happy with my G12 Purchase","A little history: I shot a lot of SLR film back in my college days, mostly for newspaper and print publications - not pro work, but still had to produce like one. Over the years I stopped having time for such things, until digital photography raised its head in the '90's and I jumped from one technology to another.  Only recently having rediscovered SLRs by way of the digital models, I've grown more and more disdainful of my various point-and-shoot models which I burned through at about one a year.I played with a friend's G11 recently and was more than a little impressed. The quality of pictures, responsiveness of the camera, balanced with the relatively compact size and breath of features sold me at once.  Reading about the G12 I bought one without even trying it.I was not disappointed. After shooting 200 pictures last week I'm very satisfied. This is a wonderful compromise in size against my Nikon digital SLR. I'm able to hand it off to friends to take a shot and they get great results as well.  The feel is sturdy, the menus and functions very straightforward, and the shots I'm getting are terrific.  Time from being turned off to taking a picture is among the fastest I've dealt with.I know there are some very negative reviews of this camera, but they're apparently from people who are upset that this wasn't more of an update from the G11, and they unfairly ding this model because they want to get a dig in on Cannon.  I don't think you have to go further than reading through their 'complaints' to understand they can be wholly dismissed.This will be my camera of choice for my trip to Mexico next month.  Really looking forward to shooting with this camera!Enjoy!""
"20101022","5.0","Great Camera!","I bought mine online at a different site since Amazon was sold out at the time. I've had it for about 2 weeks now, and really like it so far. I am not a serious professional by any means, just a semi-serious amateur. I have previously owned Sony's, Nikons, Olympus and Pentax - both P&S and DSLR.I like all the settings and played with most everything except the HD video, as I really bought the camera for photography and not video. It will be headed to Maui with me next month and I plan on buying the canon waterproof housing as well. I'll update this review when I get some photos to share.The pictures taken so far have been great, and the camera processes the images faster than I expected. It's heavy and bulky and certainly won't be mistaken for a P&S you'd find a 14 year old dragging around. Love the articulated screen, and I don't find that the buttons or dials are hard to use - neither does my boyfriend and he has big fingers.All in all, so far a great camera - pictures rival the ones from my Pentax K100 Super D DSLR. I'm happy with my purchase.""

"20101012","5.0","Not a toy, excellent photo quality for a serius photographer","I went to LA last week, from Ecuador for 10 days on vacations, I wished to have this new camera in my hands to feel it, but at Samy's store at Fairfax blvd, they didn't have the camera yet, I ordered one from Amazon, (cost &iexcl;$600 plus fast shipping! because it was the only one available at that moment, but...), finally I have it in my hands.first impressions:  small enough, not exactly a point & shoot camera, but not to big too, ideal to bring with you a better equipment than any point & shoot camera any were without to carry a big dslr and a bunch of lenses, actually y have a Canon 5d mkII, a canon 50d and I began the dslr world with the famous Canon 20d, something interesting is that I use all this cameras with a bunch of old Nikkor lenses (at least 20 years old) using an adapter ring, for me it is the perfect marriage, Canon body with old Nikkor lenses, of course I can only use the manual mode and have to use the manual focus ring to get focus but... while my sight is 20/20 love the final results.Some features about this camera:1  The lcd is fantastic, allows to take pictures or movie shoots in practical any position and situation, nice also when you are taking videos or do not want to be noticed when you are shooting, getting more spontaneous photos.2  The ergonomic of the wheels for ISO,compensation and the mode selector are very well located, they work firmly.3  The new front wheel, that works for increase or decrease the aperture or shutter speed is great.4  The menu is easy to use and I like the new formats and sizes you can take pictures, 10:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:2, 4:5 allows to get a better composition and photo formats without crop the image.5  the rugged feel is nice for me, besides is only in two parts of the camera, where your hand and fingers needs more support.6  At first instance I though the optical view finder appears to be so simple and 'awful' like somebody told before, but, the diopter corrector works fine and when I clean the visor glasses, become so clear and nice that actually I am using it a lot, because do not need to open the lcd screen and it is possible to see the green or orange light which tells you that the exposition is ok or not, 'going back to the old times'.7  I did not test enough the video, but at first look, it is ok and allows to record some interesting moments.8  The quality of the pictures is awesome, really love it, finally can get almost the quality I have with my DSLRs but in a small camera.9  It is fast, is ready to take pictures maybe in a second.10 The quality of the lcd screen may be is not the best, but, allows you to see if the picture is ok, and normally if you see that the picture is ok, when you opened in any software the picture is !really great!11 for me all the wheels are well located, the buttons are in the right place, I have a normal hands size, use xl gloves, but have not fat fingers.12 The autofocus works great, fast and with an excellent accuracy, feature not easy to find in a small camera, so reduces the possibility of loosing a nice photo.12 Could be perfect, but nothing is.This is my first week with this camera, I will let you know more and more of my experience.for now, I am really happy, fits my requirements.""
"20101011","4.0","Excellent compact camera with lots of manual controls","I had a tough time deciding between the Panasonic LX5, Nikon P7000 and the Canon G12. I did not like the colors that the Panny generated and hence ruled that camera out. I tried the Nikon P7000 out, but the slow RAW write time just killed any enthusiasm I had for that camera (it definitely is a great camera and will suit one well if they choose to overlook the lack of an articulating screen and the slow RAW write times). I ended up getting the Canon G12 and have been really happy with it. The controls are all well placed and numerous. The IQ is excellent. I took the camera for a spin to a concert this past weekend (Maroon 5) and did not expect to get any good shots. I was shocked with the results. The shots at ISO 400 were excellent (mind you this is a concert at night in low light). I have included a few shots in the galleries to give an idea. If you want to see more shots, then check out my flickr page (under username shniks). I love the fact that I can use this camera with my flashes for off camera flash photography at high shutter speeds to dramatically darken the backgrounds during the day. All in all this is a great tool for a serious photographer and one that will complement a DSLR nicely. I love it!""
"20101009","1.0","G12 IS NOT AN UPGRADE... it's a joke!","So Canon bit the bullet by inserting 'gimmicky' features like HD video & HDR snaps.  Irrelevant.  I bought the G12 for it's PHOTOGRAPHY muscle & would've been fine if it shot none-hd videos.  As for that HDR junk... that's just a lazy way of letting your camera do your image touch-up on-the-fly, when in reality-  Auto-Bracketing does the same job while having the user-flexibility to adjust the HDR output (3 pictures in 3 different exposures) to the computer.You know what Canon... if you kept the same G11 features to the G12 BUT UPGRADED THE LENS to a f/2.0, it would be considered a TRUE UPGRADED.FIX IT.""
"20101006","1.0","This One Is Going Back","Have been waiting on the new G12 and thought I had heard they were making some big changes.  When I received it, actually thought they sent me the old model cause it seemed liked the same old design.  Screen is only 2.8-inch instead of today's norm of 3.0-inch. I found the lens to be too slow and should be a f/2.0 like the S95.  IQ seems to have dropped and although it was rather expensive, I just didn't think it was worth the money.""

This is just being picky though but well... I'm picky.I've been coveting the G11 for a while and am very pleased with the G12 so far.  Even at ISO 3200 there's very little noise.""
"20101005","5.0","Feast your eyes on an upgraded G series digital camera!","First, let me say I own or have owned a G10, G11, and G12.  I am not really sure why anyone expect the G12 to be a major upgrade to the G11.  The title of this review is the first line of Canon's marketing material on the Canon USA website....so this is what I personally expected, and Canon delivered, as far as I am concerned.  I am not a professional, so my observations are from the viewpoint of an average guy with a serious camera addiction.  I took photos side by side using my G10, G11, and G12 and I have to be honest, I could not tell much difference, though a slight nod would go to the newest camera.  They are all great, however, and suit an average user like me perfectly.  My tests were not scientific and not comprehensive - I have to work for a living after all.  I am very pleased with the image quality, but is it a major upgrade from previous G series cameras, I do not think so.  If I were forced to choose one, I would probably go for the G12 because the photos look slightly nicer to me, and the camera is easier to work with but only if I am forced to choose!Build quality is also as you would come to expect from a Canon high end compact camera that costs $500.  It is excellent just like the G10 and G11.  They all feel and look pretty similar.  There is an extra rubber grip on the back for your thumb which is kind of nice.  Overall, and I have smallish hands, I find the G12 the easiest of these 3 cameras I have been comparing, to hold.Probably the most important new feature is employment of Canon's HS (high sensitivity) system  (combination of sensor and processing engine) which migrates from the EOS line.  Does it deliver on its promise to improve image quality and allow shooting at higher ISO?  I think the answer is yes it does, but not very much.  The camera maxes out at 3200 ISO marked on the dial and you can bump it up to 12,800 albeit at lower resolution using the Low Light mode.  Again, this is how it looks to my not professional rapidly aging, eyes.  Whether it is worth running out an upgrading from a G11 is totally subjective and I cannot answer this for anyone.  The camera also has the Hybrid IS system a la the updated 100mm Canon macro lens which compensates for a greater range of camera shake type.  It looked to me like the camera did a more effective job at obtaining sharper photos at the same speeds as my G11. This is important to me as my hands do shake and I enjoy macro and cannot always use a tripod.  Nor would I expect people buying a carry along point and shoot camera to carry a tripod with them.There are additional new shooting modes like HDR that takes several photos then combines them for greater detail, better exposure.  FYI, this feature was available in Ricoh cameras for sometime already, so Canon and Nikon are just catching up here.  But I think it works a bit better on the Canon than it does in my Ricoh.  The photos do look a bit richer, more detailed to me.  Canon offers a level adjuster with this camera so you can keep your photos looking, well more level.  Another feature that has been available elsewhere for years.There are other niceties about this camera. Like you can pre-set the maximum ISO level (I like because a lot of cameras seem to default to a higher ISO than I would set for myself), there is a front dial to control settings (another inheritance from the EOS line), you can control the dynamic range (just like on Sony cameras from the past) for improved highlight clipping control, and you can shoot in a 1:1 aspect ratio (square which I personally like however, you guessed it, Canon is late to the party on this feature too) to name a few.I will not comment on the video.  I never use it and if I were able to trade video capability for say, a slightly bigger or better sensor, or a faster lens, I would do so in a heartbeat.  But I have no idea if such a thing is even possible or practical.  This is only my opinion and reflects my personal set of priorities.  If it were up to me, I would dispense with most of the shooting scenes and the video if it meant a lower price or a camera with better image quality.I share the findings of many that this is an incremental upgrade of the G11 as Canon's own literature seems to suggest. Higher expectations than this may be met with disappointment.  But in my opinion, the G12 raises the bar, if only a little, of one of the best compact cameras available. I think as long as you keep what the G12 is, (an upgrade) in perspective with what it is not (evolutionary) you will not find yourself regretting your purchase.""

My first digital camera was the original G1, followed by the G5 so I have a long history with the Powershot series.  The G12 has exceeded my expectations and I expect I will be leaving the 40D at home more often.  A note - Busch's G12 book is a good supplement to the electronic manual supplied with the G12.""

"20120214","5.0","Cannon G12","This is probably the best full featured camera that fits in a coat pocket or on a belt. This means it travels with me where Full format cameras typically do not.The optical viewfinder is good for quick shots in bright light, but is not as accurate as the pull out display.  The pull out display is excellent for self / timer shots or for shooting overhead in a crowd. The hot-shoe flash is a great advantage with the companion cannon flash and is probably the best way to improve indoor photography by properly illuminating the whole room.  All other features are good and has many more than I am ever likely to use.""
"20120212","5.0","The G Series just keeps getting better","I have had the Canon G series since the G6, I moved to Canon from the Epson product line.I tend to skip generations.I used to be a full time pro, but now just like to carry a camera for family shots, the occasional artistic opportunity, and fun.The Canon G series really is well designed for this purpose.Improvements: The HS is a serious improvement in image quality. Skin tones are much more natural, colors more faithful without being over-saturated or washed out.  On a couple of recent Scout outings, with firelight pictures, the quality was acceptable.Exposure in challenging circumstances (back lit, overcast, strong point light source, etc.) are much better.I would hardly use a camera like this for 'serious' video, but the quality is more than acceptable for fun & interest.Canon brought back the articulating back!  Much appreciated.And, a subtlety - if you are familiar with any one Canon G series you can easily find your way around the next in the line. I moved from the G9 to the G12 and didn't even need to open the manual.The camera is faster focusing, faster saving images, and overall has a snappier feel.Some lament the optical finder, but occasionally it really is useful.  In scenarios where you don't want to cause a distraction using the screen, this is very useful. It's pretty wimpy compared to an SLR type optical viewfinder, but it works when needed.Battery life seems very good, I can fill up a 16GB chip with 100's of images and no issues with battery.  From the G6 to the G12 Canon has continued to improve battery life.Form factor - the camera fits the hand well, ergonomically it's a good design.  The top buttons have been rearranged to allow for easier access to exposure over-ride and exposure 'speed'.  That took a minute to re-acquaint.  It's a very nice design.Desires:Really, it's time Canon put a FASTER lens on this line.  It just seems odd they are stuck on a slow 2.8.  Why?Built in WiFi would be very useful.For now, that's it.  If you are looking for a great camera to tug along, or a camera for vacation / family events that will take GREAT pictures this is it.  Nice job, Canon.""
"20120209","3.0","Dated, limited camera...","This camera came out probably two years ago and was a minor update.  How dated?  For example, 720p for a premium camera. (The Canon 300, which has been passed by the Canon 310, and goes for $149 has 1080).  Limited?  It has the same tired F2.8 - 4.5 and is not very fast.  It has also been passed by both the S95 (better lens) and S100.  Don't forget it's pretty big, too (big enough to have a larger sensor than it has).  Amazon does do a good job with delivery and potential return.It's now a dinosaur, unlike in 2010 when it received some good reviews.  Don't bother now.""

There are a few sacrifices made here which are disappointing but not deal-breaking:A) the viewfinder is a joke, but it was a must-have for me because I hate when sun glare prevents you from seeing your shots on less substantial point and shoot camerasB) I wish the aperture opened to 2.0--I do a lot of food photography and while I can still get nice bokeh at 2.8, I would really love it at 2.0 (or even 1.8 in a perfect world, but that that's less realistic)Overall, this fantastic camera goes with me everywhere, and that's the whole point when you choose the G12 over a cumbersome DSLR.""

"20120121","5.0","For a point and shoot this is awesome.","So, I have a bunch of cameras and even though I'm not a professional I have used a lot of products.  I have been looking for a light weight point in shoot that had versatility and still takes fabulous photos.  I'm carrying my Nikon SLR around and lugging it some places is just insane.  I have had my eye on this for sometime and had a $50 promotional credit so thought I would give it a spin.  Fabulous, Fantastic, awesome photos in auto mode. And in all the preset options.  Which I'm overwhelmingly happy with cause if I wanted to get fancy I would use my SLR.  But not taking that on the Colorado River in Arizona this vacation and chancing getting it wet.  Or lugging it around an amusement park.  Or keeping in my purse for unexpectedevents.Love that I can purchase various underwater case options, lights ect. Now you are stepping up the price with average point in shoots going around $200 this is double that price. But, I personally feel you will get almost all good photos with this camera.  Worth it's weight in gold.  If you read the manual and use some of the presets for night shots, kids and pets, landscape, ect you'll be thrilled.  It is worth the extra money with photos being seriously that much better especially in low light situations. Where this camera out shines every other point in shoot I have ever tested or seen pics from. This is with the built in flash.The few negatives are: I have found Manual mode no where near as good as my SLR, and much harder to find acceptable sweet spots for photos. But actually a really good learning camera just because it has these features.  However, All the dials are super easy to use and access.The viewfinder seems blurry no matter if I have on my glasses or not.  Just turn the LCD screen around it rotates.  Don't use it less you absolutely need to.Also, the silly thing does not come with a standard manual.  You have to upload the disc and print it yourself.  Seriously CANON are you kidding me????  How cheap could you possibly be?  You built a great camera and unless people are also computer savvy they won't learn how to use it.  I find this very distasteful. You can buy a guide on how to use the camera on amazon, or you can print the 200 page manual.  Not printer/ink friendly.  That's all.  The camera can't help the manufacturer is clueless.""

Whether this is you or you just want a good point-and-shoot - but this!The photographs I have taken side-by-side to the 5D (as well as many of my friends cameras) are often just as good, if not better.  This is *the* point and shoot for most casual photographers.I went to CES this year and discovered the G-X (the step up) is essentially just 1080P video and better low-light performance.  So for the majority of shooting, this will be almost as good (putting aside the 4MB of sensor size).I previously bought the Olympus ZX-1 (or XZ-1, one of the 2) and found it to be inferior in image quality and ease of control.  This is the one to get!""
"20120115","5.0","great camera","I'm fairly new to digital photography, just getting a DSLR a couple of years ago after shooting an old Monolta 101 for 30 plus years. I found myself looking for something smaller than a DSLR but with the capabilities to be a little creative with basically a point and shoot camera.After doing a lot of research on available cameras, the G12 seemed to be the best choice for what I wanted. After having this camera for about 2 weeks now I am super pleased with my choice.Even in full auto it takes great pictures indoors and out. But when you start playing with the various manual options this camera really shines. I really like the low light capabilities, and have taken some really nice shots even by candlelight that turned out every bit as good as my DSLR. And I really like having the ISO settings on an exterior dial instead of a menu.The product does not come with a SD card and I think that is good because every body has their own opinions of what is best and they can buy what ever card seems right for them.It does not come with a printed tech manual, just a quick start guide. The manual is included on the CD that is included with the camera. As I am not too much of a tech manual reader anyway, this didn't bother me but I did purchase David Busch's book for the G12 to help me get the most of my camera. It's a good book and a lot easier reading than a manual.In conclusion ,so far this camera has been everything I hoped it would be and more. I am already thinking of replacing my current DSLR(not a Canon) with one of Canon's DSLR models.P.S.  I have not even tried the video capabilities of the camera yet so will have to update this when I do.""
"20120112","4.0","This camera is the whole package","First, let me explain my reason for giving this camera a four-star rating. It's so full of features that it may scare some people away. Although it's a point-and-shoot camera, it does so much more than that. Within its compact body there are features which give tremendous creative control to the photographer. You can alter exposure speed, light sensitivity, the point of focus; if you want to take multiple shots without waiting for the camera to recycle, you can do that; you can also create sophisticated videos. Every button and control has several functions, and the creative menus (which can also be customized) are extensive. There's so much to learn about the camera, I bought a guide book to teach me all of them. This returns me to my initial point: If you're looking for a good camera which takes good pictures, you can probably do better with one which is less expensive. If you're looking for a very good camera which will allow you to expand your creative potential, you can do very well with this camera.Two additional points. 1. G12 does almost everything that an SLR does, but is much more compact. 2. It's one of the few compact point-and-shoot cameras which has a view finder.""

I love the size of the S95 and the speed of the lens at the wide end but the G12 has a great battery (bigger), doesn't get warm (video), has an articulating LCD, and a viewfinder (not a good one but better than nothing).  It has some metal parts.  More dials rather than using the LCD.  Easier to hold.What's not so great?  Few improvements made.  For example, same good (but slowish) lens in the G11.  Sensor could have been made a bit bigger, too.  Video is just OK.  As noted, viewfinder could be better.  Of course, harder to carry than S95.Excellent all around camera with good IQ.

"20120106","5.0","Great Camera for the Down-to-Earth Enthusiast","When you tell people that you're getting into photography, the first thing you'll hear is: 'Photography is an expensive hobby'. I knew about the necessary evils of photography from the beginning and wanted a camera where the accessories would not put me in debt. I wanted a camera with the portability of a point and shoot but also with the fun of a DSLR. The G12 satisfied all my requirements:- DSLR-quality photos even on auto modeAs I'm still learning about photography, many of my pictures are in auto mode. The pictures are almost as pleasing as the Canon T2i.- PortableWith an actual DSLR, you cannot carry it everywhere you go. My sister-in-law has a DSLR and she seldom ever uses her DSLR anymore. Instead, she uses her iPhone--ugh... She's tried to lend me her DSLR before and the first things I realized when her camera bag was in my lap were: too many accessories and too big.

"20120102","3.0","A good deal, but so many better (but more $) cameras are available now","My wife bought me this camera for Christmas and I ended up returning it and putting the money towards a Sony A55 'beamsplitter' SLR. I like this Canon G12 camera, and it does everything you could want, but the quality difference between this camera and one of the larger sensor SLR or mirrorless cameras is evident. The first thing I wanted to do with this camera was to take some HDR photos which is possible because it has useful built-in bracketing. Unfortunately, I found that doing HDR is useless unless the lens is set to 'wide.' If you zoom into something, the dynamic range goes way down. I could see this in my HDR software. This is probably caused by the all-in-one design of the camera- the extra light from the lens elements are probably lighting up the sensor inside the camera and this can't be fixed later in software. The built-in HDR mode is pretty useless (besides the previously mentioned dynamic range problem) because the camera is slow to take several photos and the HDR mode does not do any image alignment so it is nearly impossible to get a good HDR photo that does not have artifacts in it from movement of the camera or the environment between the shots. I dunno. I was conflicted because this camera was a gift and it is a really great deal for the price and it has many features that prosumer cameras don't all have such as exposure bracketing to 3 ev and saving to raw and HDR, but I realized that I needed to be able to get better lenses and a better sensor to take the photos I want to take so I got the Sony A55 and some lenses and ended up spending a lot more $$$$.""

"20120101","5.0","Wife Pleaser","My wife desired a small digital camera with a view finder and one that did not intimidate the average user (another way to say novice without offending anyone).  View finders are hard to come by in today's smaller digitized mode but there are some out there.  I was torn between the Nikon and Canon offerings and elected to go with the Canon from previous reviews on picture quality.  It also seemed to be one that had enough automatic features that would make the wife pleased yet have enough enhanced features that would please me, another average user who experiments from time to time, and my son who is an above average user.  The camera was a hit with all players and performs wonderfully.  The view finder and flip screen are user friendly and the overall fit and form live up to expectations.  The flip screen has a quality image and gives a good representation of what the camera is doing. We now have three Canon cameras in the family (two SLR's and the G12)and are pleased with all of them and the G12 gives us performance in a small form factor which is great when you want to travel lite.

My favorite part is the movable screen (almost all of the pics with me and my husband are him holding the camera out and trying to not cut our heads off).  This screen lets us see what the picture will look like.  I also love the continual shoot.  Life moves fast sometimes, but this lets you catch it!

The macro is excellent and I love the fact you can mount a full size flash. The battery life is very good and the images are wonderful. It has full features that would be found on a lot of SLR cameras and easy to access controls!The bad thing about this camera is the lack of a full printed users manual explaining how to use all the features(this is why you get three stars). Canon will tell you all the excellent features on G12 but you will have to view the instructions online, on disc or print them at home. According to Canon, this is an effort to be 'green'. How is this being green when you have aftermarket manuals being published??? To me this is insulting after paying for an advance camera and then getting a bare bone manual that shows me how to use the 'auto' features. Some of us planing on being away from the computer or traveling light when using a camera. I guess Canon expect me to lug around a laptop or iPad or print up my own manual the size of a small city phone book to explain how to use their camera. Well Canon, I'm having someone cutting down a tree for paper to print one of your manuals so I can use your camera away from a computer.

"20111224","3.0","This is what not advertised about Canon G12 Powershot.","It shoots RAW, but Canon software is not user-friendly. Adobe requires you to download several separate pieces of software (installer, manager, plug-in, converter, patch etc), neither one of which seems to work, and they take enormous amount of space on your hard drive. Purchasing Lightroom 3 or similar software is an option for another several hundred dollars.Third party hack is available, but for a different firmware version that was on the camera. If you know a software engineer, who can spend several hours making this work, give it a try! After spending my entire Christmas I get an 'Error Loading Updater Workflow' message!I was looking for a pocket pro-grade compact camera when outside studio. Aiptek was my previous ultimate shooter, but I am looking for higher quality in photo and video production value for my reference field shots and video, while on the go. I work with Creo back, Hasselblad, Canon 5Ds, and other equipment.I have tried the Canon G12. This could be a great camera. Although it has one big issue! It will not change focus in the video mode while recording, and this is a big problem. To change the focus, you have to stop recording, refocus, and start shooting again. Although, there is a 'firmware update' by the third party of 'enthusiasts', basically a hack, which supposed to fix that issue. But there are so many different versions, depending on the camera's firmware, so you have to be nearly a programmer to figure this out, as mentioned.Not sure if G12, without capability to change focus while shooting, is a great near-professional pocket camera. There is also no jack for external mic on the G12 either. So it needs a separate portable audio recorder. G12 has no option for using an audio mixer, since there is no audio jack.The 5x zoom is really not needed there at all. It is inconvenient for fast shooting because it is requiring 2- or 3-step compensation in exposure/shutter speed (or ISO) to get consistently exposed shots (unless in Auto ISO mode, which may give high grain the higher ISO readings). Besides the zoom mechanism may be a problem, since it has moving parts. It would be better to have just an accessory kit (which is an option anyway with this camera) with wide angle and telephoto, while the camera would not have the optical zoom at all. The zoom makes it harder to carry in the pocket.I am still looking, and not even sure if there is such a camera on the market, like a little Aiptek.Besides, the camera will not charge the battery through the USB connection, so you have to carry external charger. The camera will allow to download files from the card while connected to a PC computer, but will not allow to upload. There is always a need for external card reader. Camera will not work with Mac Pro, and provided by Canon Mac software has additional issues. Theses are minor things I could live with. This is about the best point and shoot camera, if some of the issues could be addressed and worked out. Third party hack provides most of the solutions, if working properly.""

While I have a Canon DSLR, I needed something smaller and lighter for walking around.  Unfortunately, the G12 did both things poorly and only one trip to the field made this clear.  The viewfinder was worthless and the shutter release  too slow.

I primarily used the camera in Auto mode, assuming that it would take decent pictures without me having to reprogram or set up every shot (I have a two-year-old, so the aforementioned set up is impossible between pictures). I was wrong. The pictures looked okay on the small LCD screen, but loaded on my computer and printed, they looked terrible with unbalanced lighting and blurred images (in both night and day). In fact, my point and click Casio Exilim actually took better pictures when they were compared side by side. In the end, I returned the Canon G12 and got a Nikon D3100, which was more expensive, but is an amazing camera that I couldn't be happier with!Disclaimer: I am not a professional photographer or even a very good one. However, I think most buyers of this product are also novices or amateurs because professionals would spend a lot more money for their equipment.

"20111126","5.0","A great camera","I bought this camera a week before I left for India on a holiday and the David Busch book turned up two days before so I didn't have much time to experiment with it before I left. For many years I had a film SLR and was an enthustiast but gave up my SLR many years ago as my interest waned and had been using a nice Sony compact digital for the last few years.I quickly flicked through the Busch book and grasped the basics of the controls and left for India with just a basic knowledge. I therefore left the camera on auto because everything happens so fast there and there's no time to fiddle and adjust. When I did have time I was able to find the necessary adjustment button quite quickly and the results were everything I could have asked for.I have just returned and had the first opportunity to review the photos on my TV.I must say that I am in awe of this camera. The colours are superb and brought out all the richness of Indian colours and that is with std AWB and without the vivid colour feature.The video was outstanding in my opinion within its limits (no zooming or focus adjusting while filming) but it didn't effect the overall result.The photos look very sharp and as good as a SLR when played on the TV or computer.Low light pictures were again very good and of course there's going to be some grain but it didn't spoilt the photo and we're talking about really low light stuff here.There are many more features I have to learn to bring out the best in the camera and many hundreds of hours of reading as well. But you can be safe in the knowledge that while you are learning you can leave it to the camera and it won't let you down.There's only one caveat and that is I wish it had a slightly longer zoom. There were times I could have done with something a bit longer. However, I bought the camera knowing this and that doesn't detract from the score.""

This year I was faced with the decision of either buying a superzoom (Shortlist: Canon SX230 or Sony HX-9V) or an enthusiast compact (Shortlist: Canon G12, Nikon P7000 and Olympus XZ1). After a long and careful consideration, I decided to go down the enthusiast compact route. The principal reason being I really wanted great image quality close to that of the 7D.The Nikon P7000 was rules out due to the reviews regarding its hit and miss operational speed. The XZ1 is a nice camera but the C12 won at the end as I already have a Canon system. The ability to share accessories such as flashes with the dSLR is an important consideration. Also while others may lament the bulk of the G12. I prefer a bit of bulk to aid stability when holding the camera.In real life usage, the G12 operational speed is impressive. It is almost instant and ready to shoot when you switch it on. There is no perceptible lag in between shoot. The operational speed is far closer to that of a dSLR than the compact cameras. Image quality is also great. The JPG image quality as good as the 7D to the untrained eyes (particularly at ISO400 or below). I have yet to experiment with RAW but I expect great results given all the positive reviews. I also like the dials and switches which allow direct control instead of going through touch screen or screens of menus.My two gripes are the little grip space at the back which means the thumb can hit the control wheels too easily. This takes a bit of getting used to coming from a 7D which has great ergonomics. The other is the OVF which is not really useful useful (show only 80%) and may be only useful under bright sun light. Having said the above, every design has compromises and I can live with design compromises of the G12. The other thing to be aware is the you simply can't do nice bokeh with the little sensor. This limitation is the same for all compacts.In summary. I will take the G12 everywhere when I don't want to lug the 7D around. Great little camera!""
"20111012","4.0","Mostly Pleased--a Few Gripes","I wanted a very compact, high quality, camera with a viewfinder that I could take everywhere in a small belly pack. It's replacing an 8-year old Olympus Camedia with a 10x zoom that could not be repaired for lack of parts.I'm pleased that the G12 is even more compact than the old one but, although the optical viewfinder is adequate, it doesn't come up to the quality of the digital viewfinder in the old Olympus. I especially like the solid and well-balanced 'feel' of the camera but would be happier if the zoom toggle were a bit larger.Picture quality is excellent and the enormous array of features are very useful and well-organized. They will take some time to master. The included 'manual' is limited (the camera's annotated menu feature is somewhat helpful, but only as a refresher) and so I've purchased the David Busch guide and find it very good.I would have preferred a longer zoom, and think 5x is a bit too restrictive for such a sophisticated camera, so I'm purchasing the Canon Tele-converter to compensate.The updated technology (8 years is a long time in the digital world) is greatly welcome and, overall, despite the shortcomings and learning curve, I think the G12 will fit my needs well.""
"20111011","4.0","The G12 is a great camera","I've had it for two weeks, and it's gorgeous camera to hold and use.  As a former DSLR user who didn't want to carry a bag, I think this camera will do almost everything I needed.  Of course, with a smaller sensor, image quality doesn't compete with DSLRs but it's quite good.The self-capping lens is genius. It's not easy to learn and remember all the manual options, but it's reassuring to have them.  The LCD is wonderful, but the optical viewfinder is not very practical.  It takes excellent 720P movies at 24 fps, but the fact that you can't (optically) zoom while filming was a real problem for me.  Digital zooming is unusable.It's a great camera, but... I'll be exchanging it for the Fuji X10, coming out in November ($140 more expensive).  Bigger sensor, 1080p movies at 30 fps and zooming in all modes.  No knock on the G12... I'm just super-picky and anal retentive.""
"20111010","5.0","Love it...just what I was looking for","My old Canon Power Shot was a great camera (abour 3 yrs old) but my sons first birthday was approaching and I wanted to take my picture taking to the next level. I'm not pro but I love to take photos and think I do a pretty good job. This camera is perfect for me because the auto setting takes great shots but theres lots to play with too. I can really grow into this camera..the different settings are fun and easy to use and then theres some that I will have to take the time to learn about. I like the sports/action mode. It allows me to take several pictures without taking the time to refocus each time..my baby can be moving around and most of the time they don't come out blurry and I'm able to catch that perfect shot. The low light setting is great too. If you set it to low light but dont want the bright flash (and it is bright!) then as long as theres some light turn the flash off and turn the wheel to -2 and the pic looks really natural like it was taken in a well light room. Zoom is just enough...wouldn't want more than that and the pictures stay really clear. If your on the fence about getting the next step up without going to a full on DSLR camera jump off the fence and buy the G12...you will love it!""
