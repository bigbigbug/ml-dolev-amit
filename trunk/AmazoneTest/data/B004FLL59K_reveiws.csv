"20120603","4.0","Works well but can be fragile","I am an Advanced Practice Nurse and I use the Mini M200 to take educational wound pictures at the hospital. It has done a very effective job in realistically photographing wounds that I blow up on the computer to make presentations to my fellow medical professionals. I especially appreciate the fidelity in the close-up shots I take of wounds. The compact design lends itself to this task because it is easy to carry and use without being a distraction. The only caveat I have had with the Mini M200 is it feels cheap and fragile. In regular use at the hospital, not a demanding environment for a camera, the protective battery cover popped off of the hinge and refused to snap back on. I have filed a repair request with Kodak and now I have to wait and see if they will repair the camera under the warranty. Other than this battery cover issue the camera has worked very well. If it had with a little more robust design and construction I would give this camera a 5-star rating but this problem holds the rating to just 4-stars.""

However, the 'red' is really neon hot pink and the 'blue' is really a bright baby blue.So, if you don't mind having a hot pink or baby blue camera then this is a decent choice; but don't be expecting a red camera because it isn't going to happen.""

Upon opening one of the boxes, I was shocked to see a neon pink camera with a neon pink and yellow case. The other six boxes also had neon pink cameras! I would be the laughing stock of the event if I handed those out...Hopefully I get this issue resolved or else I'll have to pray that the recipients have a sense of humor...""

I finally experimented a little and fortunately found out I had another memory card at home and it worked perfectly and that there was something wrong with the new memory card. So i advise you to not buy some memory card that is 4GB and that costs only $4.00. The Camera price is actually very reasonable and cheap in a good way and the picture quality is awesome. If you are attached to this camera than take it because it's really great but just get the memory card from somewhere else.""
"20120527","3.0","disappointed","I buy all my products from amazon based on the reviews of others. I have to say my experience with this camera does not match the glowing reviews I had read. It is very small and the button used to take a picture is also very small. The downside to that is that it is very difficult not to shake the camera when taking a picture. I am an experienced photographer and have never had this problem with any other camera before. Most of my pictures turn out blurry as a result, rendering this camera a waste of money.""

Pretty camera, nice price, but when I loaded the battery and plugged the camera in, it wouldn't charge.  Note, the instructions are extremely simple, there's a little diagram on the camera itself that shows how the battery should go in and, moreover, the battery won't fit into the camera if the battery is oriented wrong; the end of the charging cord that goes into the camera can only go in one way because of the shape of the plug and the same thing is true for the other end that goes into the wall plug.  So, the problem was not user error.""

The battery charge seems to last quite a while, and is easy to recharge, so she shoots away without missing the side of a building, her shoe, or her smiling face from 6 inches away - need to work on some photography skills with her.

I had to take several shots to get one good photo but I guess it's decent for the price. HOWEVER, this camera uses a special micro usb 5-pin cable. I called Kodak and they were out of stock and told me to go on Amazon to order it. If you search on Amazon you'll see it's pricey and sometimes not compatible. $17 cable for a $70 camera????

Excellent photos and small enough, and light enough, to put in a paints or shirt pocket and not bulge or feel heavy at all.  In fact, it's easy to not even think about the fact that I have a camera with me.  As for size, I can easily hold it in the palm of my hand.  This is the camera I want for everyday activities and where convenience matters.  I can just grab it, stuff it in a normal pocket, and go.  It's there for every candid or spur of the moment shot that I would have missed.I find this camera much more versatile, with many more features, than any cell phone camera.  And since it's so small and has so much more capability, there's every reason to take it along.  And it's certainly much easier to upload and share these photos.  The software works perfectly and is simple and straightforward.Okay, you get the idea I'm pretty happy with this purchase.

"20110913","5.0","I love this..","This is what I have been searching for. I had canon camera. It's ok, but it's expensive and thick. I move around a lot and single so I needed something very tiny I can put it in somewhere in my bag and never know I am carrying. The only thing available like that small was old sony cyber shot. The price went up after it's discontinued and it's merely 2mb photo. So, I was searching and then I found this camera coming out. I was so thrilled. I grabbed it since it was on sale. I would have paid 99 dollar cuz there is nothing like this. So, I couldn't be happier. I took some photo and the photos are better than I could ever expect. I have had kodak before. I didn't like it. I didn't like canon either. Pictures weren't that good. It was dark and it looks like they want to make the picture pretty rather than crisp and lively. This one does that. I like it a lot. It's so so small and light. It's almost like children's toy but it's not. It has all the function that normal people would want and it's fairy easy to operate. I loved HP camera. It's so so so easy to operate and there is like no button but the round navigation button and on and off, but, it's ok. This one is near easy. I don't need such and such function. I like just shot and go. The picture is definitely better quality than canon. My canon is cheap one but more than double of this camera's price. what a bargen. Thank you thank you Kodak. I wish they make portable printer. Portable is ripp off and many many people would want to hands on. They now making printer but it's so bulky like every other printer makes. Somehow they make it big. I guess people at the office like big ones, but it's not for me at home. It was going to become smaller at some point but then it got bigger again. They figured it sell better when it's bigger? Down side is small portable ones becomes rip off. They can just put any price and we don't have choice but to buy big one for a cheap or pay extra extra for small ones but they look like they could be switched. Small ones cheap and bigger ones expensive because bigger ones has much more function and have LCD! I hate that. They switch price. :(""
"20110820","5.0","Pleasantly Surprised","My 6 year old son had been asking me for a camera for about a year, so on vacation I gave in. He told me he wanted a blue camera and pointed to this one. I'm normally a researcher, but the price on this compared to other comparable or 'better' cameras couldn't be beat. Boy am I impressed! This camera takes better pictures than the Nikon Coolpix I bought for my husband! Honestly! I started using this camera for all of our vacation pictures and just love it. I may not give it back to him. : )What I don't like is the software that comes with it. It is slow to load, freezes and gets touchy about which photos it will let you crop. You are better off using your choice of photo editing software, although it did do a decent job enhancing some of my more distant landscape shots. Don't buy it for the software, buy it because it's a great little camera at a great price.""

"20110718","3.0","cute but complicated","This is the third Kodak camera I own ; this is the tiniest of all which is great; it is light and takes good pictures. The reason why I don't like it too much is that it is more complicated to use; the last small one had a small wheel on the top that made it easy to adjust it to close-ups etc. This one doesn't have that practical solution, it takes more time to find what you are looking for. Also it is more complicated a slower to transfer the pictures to your computer. I admit I am technically somewhat challenged but this is the type of camera that is supposed to be used by people like me.The price is good though and I hope it doesn't die on my too soon.""

"20110520","3.0","caught unprepared!!!","Now that I've bought a 16GB SDHC hi-speed card AND a battery charger K7700 for this camera, I love it!  As an inexperienced digital camera user, I didn't realize the camera itself would only hold 10 (ten) pictures!!!  I was so excited about getting the camera in time for Easter, when it failed me fast.  I fault the DESCRIPTION of the camera for this.  It might have made a difference in my decision.Most of the instructions are written with the assumption you already know how to use a digital camera.  Nothing for rank beginners like me.Overall, I really like it.  It's lightweight & small & easily carried in my purse or pocket.  It takes decent pictures, which I hope with time will improve as I gain more experience.One other thing which I don't particularly like is that the USB cord & power cord are one & the same.  To solve this problem, I bought a battery charger K7700 from Kodak, which comes with a 7006 battery, so I could have a charged battery at all times.  I don't think the K7700 advertised on Amazon comes with a battery - at least I couldn't find any description that said so.Now I've spent about $150 (my upper limit) on this camera, when I was so thrilled about finding it at $89.  That's disappointing.  Chalk it up to inexperience.  Next time I'll know what questions to ask.""

"20110423","4.0","Somewhat of a basic model for Kodak","Kodak, after Canon, is my favorite brand of camera, due to the sturdiness of the casing and the wonderful way they have in-camera programs which other cameras require you to do on the computer. You can edit videos on the camera, clipping out frames from video, and so on. If they just added extremely high speed video, I'd be ecstatic, because I love to shoot lightning storms and then clip out the best individual frames as stills. 30 frames per second is pretty slow when it comes to lightning. But enough about me. Like all Kodaks, this is sturdy, with excellent in-camera editing features such as panorama, video editing, touching up photos, and a variety of 'scenes', which is Kodak speak for different settings for different photo ops. It is absurdly, delightfully small---smaller than my blackberry. It's smaller than a deck of cards.  It's somewhat basic in comparison to my z1485, which is basically a tiny almost-SLR. But if you want a camera to grab as you're dashing out the door, this is it. A word on Kodaks: I went to Iraq and I wound up killing two cameras, or rather the heat did, along with the rough and tumble conditions. I think the heat is what fried them, literally, because on some days, it was 100+ by 9AM---in the shade. By noon it was unspeakable.  A friend gave me a floor model, used, from a store, and that camera got kicked around, subjected to the conditions that had killed the other two cameras, the heat, the dust, and the abuse, and though by the end of the tour I had to keep the battery compartment shut with a rubber band, it still worked just fine. When I got home I upgraded to another Kodak. I gave the old one---still equipped with the rubber band----to a soldier friend, who in turn took it to Iraq with her. It came back with her in fine shape but finally back home, it gave up the ghost, yet was in good enough shape to be sold for parts on Ebay. Its successor---the much beloved V505---went to friends when I upgraded from that one, and that too performed admirably till it got fried in an electrical incident. Every Kodak I've had---and I have three now---- are tough, small, and versatile. I'm very fond of them, and all they need to do now is to make a camera that has night vision and shoots at FPS1000.  That's all I ask. Until then, I've got these in my bag when I go out the door.""
