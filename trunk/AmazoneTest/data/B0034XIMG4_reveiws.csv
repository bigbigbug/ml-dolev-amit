I received my used Nikon Coolpix L110 and I couldn't be happier with my first impression.  The camera was provided in a timely manner and works perfectly.  As it was described, there are a couple of minor spots indicative of prior use.  These are so minor I only mention them because the camera was so well disclosed.  Everything was provided in the original box with CD, strap,cords and manuals. I even got the batteries. LOL""
"20111221","1.0","Worst camera ever","This camera is possibly the worst camera I have ever used.  I desperately needed to get an upgrade from my 5 yr old Sony with 4 megapixels so I researched quite a bit about this camera and thought it would be a wise decision without having to buy a digital slr.  Not a wise decision at all!!  I have been so frustrated at how every picture I have taken is blurry.  I even took it on a trip at which point the camera decided to stop all together.  After letting it sit for a couple of months, I decided to try it again.  It would take a picture but still blurry.  No matter what setting I have it on, blurry pictures!!  The menus are awful to navigate through.  Preview mode doesn't stay on when trying to look through pictures.  Just moving the camera takes it out of preview.  I'm definitely looking into a slr now but probably won't even stick with the Nikon series at all.""

"20110115","4.0","Great camera!","I wanted a reasonably priced camera with at least a 15x zoom and this camera fits the bill.  Takes wonderful pictures with a little manipulation of the settings.  I'm used to a point-and-shoot camera (my Canon died after 8 years) where I didn't have to change the settings to get a great picture.  After a couple weeks of trial-and-error with the settings, I have taken wonderful pictures.  Some reviews complain of the blurring in the pictures- yes, I had that also.  I made a couple setting changes and no more blurring.  I just took it to a basketball game and didn't get one blurry picture of all the action.  I would highly recommend this camera for someone looking for a nice camera at a reasonable price.""

"20110108","5.0","EXACTLY what I wanted!!!!! Don't have issues with blurry pix.","I was a little reluctant to buy this camera after seeing so many of the reviews complain about blurry photos but I really liked the way it felt in my hand vs. the Kodak so I took a chance and bought it. Sooooooo glad I did. I was looking for a camera that could take pictures where my $200 point and shot digital camera failed such as sport shots. I tested it in the back yard with my kids and was incredibly pleased. I had to alter the white balance a little (and I had to look that up since I'm a mom-type photographer) and was happy with the the results. I tested some inside shots and again was pleased with the zoom. I did experience some blur but honestly with a zoom, if you don't hold your hands still, yeah, you will get a blurry picture. I don't use a tripod and have had no issues as of yet. VERY glad I bought the camera!!!""
"20110108","5.0","Point and Shoot and Beyond","We purchased this camera for Christmas for our son who has shown some interest in photography.  We didn't want to go full blown DLSR, but we wanted to something a bit beyond a traditional point and shoot.  He has already taken some stellar wildlife photos along with a couple great shots of the family dog.  The optical zoom is unbelievable.  The camera isn't going to fit in your pocket like a digital elf, but that isn't what it was designed for.  On the other hand, it is perhaps only a third of the size of a DLSR, so it has a fair amount of portability.  The 3 inch screen is great for reviewing shots on the camera.  You can see the screen quite well in bright light.The camera has a ton of features that will allow him to experiment with more advanced photo techniques as he grows into them, yet it is taking brilliant pictures right out of the box.  We couldn't be happier.""
"20110108","5.0","Clarity, Detail of photos","Built solid, the L110 is very worth the price. The flashbar must be manually raised, a mixed blessing, taking time to start shooting, yet, for novices, the lack of an auto-pop-up flashbar means that the automatic mechanism won't be broken, by accidentally holding it down, when it wants to pop-up. Also, the lens cap must be removed before powering on, since the lens extends right away, right out to about an inch from the lens cap ring.The Clarity and detail are very noticable. In highest resolution mode, a class 10 SD memory can get 20 frames in one second. I expected to be held back to a lower resolution mode, for this shot mode. I haven't tried sport-continuous, as stated in the features, resolution has to be lowered, for that shot mode.I just like the way it l00ks. Red is great. Deep red colour, and a metallic glossy deep red at that. The Camera has the air of an expensive one, and flair, point and shoot nature, and with the Nikor lens and optics, I've gotten some pictures I've been unable to get with other cameras.I remember other cameras I've had, that I allowed a friend to use, to shoot something, and upon telling them to please not touch the lens, that's exactly what they seem to do, by human nature, so the L110 is my baby, not to be used by anyone else, barring another afficionado to photography.""
"20110107","5.0","best camera for the money","Our old Kodak wasn't keeping up with our boys on the ball field, and we didn't have the money for a top of the line (or bottom of the line, for that matter) DSLR. I think this camera is the next best thing. The Nikon L110 meets our needs for sports shots and everyday picture-taking. I highly recommend reading the instructions and taking time to play with different picture settings because this camera has a lot to offer, especially if you're upgrading from a camera with few features. Judging by the pictures posted by others with this camera, I've only scratched the surface of what this camera can do.""

I really wanted to replace the HP we have been using for some time as it did the job we needed and truly was point and shoot. However, that model is no longer available, so, knowing Nikon for many years decided to give it a go. We will eventually understand this one I'm sure, in the mean time the photos that are pretty bad we will delete and try-try-try again!! lolOne reason I chose this Camera is:It uses double 'A' batteries.

It is well worth the money for all casual picture taking.""

After owning this camera for several months (and taking 100s of pics.), I went back and looked at the reviews.  In particular, I read the >20 1-star reviews.  Yep!  Lots of people have problems with the image quality and the stabilizing feature (NOT HELPED BY THE ABSENCE OF A VIEWFINDER!).It's wierd.  If you zoom in on the image of any photo, even those taken on the highest quality Image Mode setting, everything is fuzzy.  Nothing is sharp.  Image edges, and details, look like they have been painted with pastels.  I have much-cheaper cameras that produce much better images.This camera is a waste of money.  Either buy a cheap point-and-shoot, or buy an SLR.""
"20101228","4.0","Reliable mid sized camera","Easy to start, takes snaps quick in succession, easy file transfers to computer, amazing battery life.Lens cleaning is a routine requirement due to the big sized lens. Neck strap is a must to carry this.Usually needs tripod for low light settings in easy auto mode.Some times one is not sure if flash is working in this mode but mostly pictures are good. When flash does not fire, one might expect blurry snaps and moving objects trailing, better to retake, it is pretty fast for retakes.I tried using other modes and finally settled to easy auto with good lighting as my choice. sports continuous is also pretty good but small sized images.I am a mild user so I need more practice to fully understand this camera's capabilities.

I don't have to worry about going through a menu, pulling up the flash and all that to get a good picture. Nearly all of the pictures I have taken inside are blurry and every one of the pictures that I took using the zoom lens are extremely blurry - just have to be dumped. I frequently need cute pictures on the spur of the moment and by the time this camera is ready, the moment is over. I also have not been able to get the movies I took to play back on the computer. You would also think that my living room was as long as a football stadium because everyone is so far away in the picture. Maybe after I read this 300 page booklet, I will know how to make this thing work better but I will never be satisfied with having to scroll through a menu (baby has already moved) or raising the flash. I can't believe that I like the cheap Kodak better! (Guess I could have made this a video review but no one would ever see it using this camera).""

"20101226","5.0","Great Camera for the Price","I recently purchased this camera, and I definitely made the right choice.  I wanted a point and shoot that was good quality, but wouldn't break the bank.  What I've found is that the L110 is excellent quality for it's price range!  If you've ever owned a digital camera, then you're pretty much ready to start taking pictures once you pop the batteries in the camera.  The Easy Auto mode makes taking pictures really easy.  Just point and shoot!I am really pleased with the image quality.  My pictures are clear and sharp.  I've even taken some pictures indoors without the flash, and they came out great!  The room was well-lit, so I didn't get any yellow shots that some others have complained about.  The macro mode works really well if you're into macro photography.  I took some test shots with the lens almost touching the objects, and the detail of the pictures was amazing.I haven't used the Sport Continuous mode yet, so I can't vouch for that particular feature.  I am in agreement with those who suggest using a tripod when the zoom is fully extended.  I only got one clear picture out of five when testing the zoom.  Here's where having a viewfinder would come in handy, but it's not a big enough problem to make me change my mind about the camera.The lcd is bright and sharp, and you can adjust the brightness.  The camera itself is surprisingly lightweight, and I like the way it feels in my hands.  If you're looking for a high quality, digital camera in this price range, you should definitely consider the L110.""
"20101225","5.0","I like it, but----------------------","......you do have to be smarter than the camera as it is not exactly a point and shoot....It has a host of likable features that someone with old photo experience will appreciate, as well as a host of imaging modes....If its not outdoors in bright lights, you will likely have to change settings to maximize the odds of your getting the pic, and you will definite need to follow the fundamental rules of low-light photography; those whining about blurred pics clearly are not smarter than the camera. I'm getting some really nice/pleasing pics with it in non-point & shoot lighting conditions, particularly with the 1600ASA.Its light weight, I love the 15x optical zoom. I get a good run on NiMh bats, but I shoot mostly at 5mp, I've turned all the sounds off except for the shutter, and turn it off after every pic.Mine has been on a mutli-night hike to the bottom of the Grand Canyon, and to the summit of Longs Peak, with pics that stop folks in their tracks, in all lighting conditions from the dark of an alpine night, to moon light, to noon desert.If you're looking for a no-brainer point & shoot, and you are not up on the basic rules of sharp picture, not in sync with getting mentally & physically in tune with snagging a pic, this isn't the camera for you. Though, it does point & shoot like a champ in the correct point & shoot conditions.Like I said, I like it, a lot, but as an old 35SLR guy from the days when they didn't have internal light metering systems, I am smarter than both the L110 and the conditions in which I like to take pics. This was a no brainer for meAs the prices come down, I'll likely be picking a couple more L110s up for the out years as the technology rapidly moves on. But then, I'm still packing a couple Olympus C-2100s and C-750s as I really like them too.""

Other than those two things it is an extremely good camera.  It is a good value for the money it costs.""
"20101220","1.0","Horrible, it look green","I love Nikon for professional DSLR camera's I own a D300 and love it great quality.However our yearbook staff just had this camera donated.  1. horrible quality (looks green)  2. you can not easily access basic controls without going all the way thru several menusIn closing if you don't have much money go buy a Kodak camera for $99.00 so much better quality same size.""
"20101217","2.0","much better options for the money","First off Nikon makes some excellent camera's this is just not one of them. This camera feels great in the hand and has a great if not industry leading LCD screen on the back. I purchased this camera to replace a 5 year old Canon powershot S2 IS and returned it 3 days later due to terrible picture quality. The image stabilization and low light picture quality is some of the worst I've seen. I would say save your money and buy a better camera but you could spend less money and get a better camera. I truly don't understand the glowing reviews this camera is receiving.""

"20101213","5.0","review of camera","I was disappointed in the amount of internal memory.  I took the camera away with me and found out it would only hold 11 pictures.  I think I could of changed a setting, but didn't learn about that until I came home.  I had planned on buy more internal memory, I just felt that the camera should have come with more.""
"20101211","4.0","Slightly better than average","Having only owned two super zoom cameras including this Nikon, I have to say my lowly Kodak Z712is camera is the better of the two. That's a three year difference in technology.The Kodak offered full manual control, and an electronic viewfinder.This Nikon doesn't offer either. What it does offer is controls best suited to a simpleton. I don't always want my camera to automatically pick it's shooting mode.I want to be the one that does that. Knowing what I know now about this camera, I probably would have went with a like sized Canon.There are some good points though.12mp is a huge plus nowadays.3' screen with anti reflective coating is a huge plus.Decent optics.15X zoom while not close to some of the more expensive cameras is more than adequate for your average shooter.Battery life is great with Lithium batteries.The camera is fast to come on, fast to take the shot once locked on, and fast to store.Pictures are good provided you know how to take a photo.Low light pictures can be captured using the auto mode and upping the ISO.You will have grainy shots of course, but you can then lock on to distant objects with just 1 ambient table lamp on.The bad points.No manual control.Slow to lock onto a subject.Speed shots are limited to 3mpEasy mode doesn't know what's it's doing half the time.Manual flip up flash...Even the Kodak's flash popped up automatically when needed.""

"20101209","1.0","Don't Bother with this garbage","I have had a number of different cameras, film and digital and I have to say this Nikon was the biggest disappointment of all the cameras I have owned.  The focus was lousy, the vibration control hardly worked.  It did awlful in low light.  The controls were poorly arranged and the manual(book) was overly redundant.  I let my wife try it out for a week and she was very disappointed in it too.  I plan to return this and either acquire an Canon or a less expensive Fuji which I know works better than this piece of crap.""
"20101209","4.0","A step up from the point and shoot","I bought this camera mainly to take higher quality pics of my four kids.  And...I love this camera.  Many reviewers complain about blurry or yellowed pictures.  I had the same problem at first.  I was frustrated and wanted to return the product.  But, it seems that with this camera, you have to read the manual with the camera in hand.  Experiment with different settings.  (For example, I have better results setting the ISO at a higher number than the preset)  Also, you need to give the camera a chance to focus and use a light touch with your 'trigger finger'.  After much practice and referring to the manual many times, I am taking gorgeous pictures.It's light, balanced, and the rubber grip makes it feel secure in your hand.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a step up from a regular point and shoot.""

"20101203","4.0","Nice cam, but no manual control and video is not great","The camera is ok, comes with a really good Nikkor lens, and takes great pictures. However, people expecting some manual controls will be disappointed. The zoom is extremely good, but when in maximum zoom the clarity is not reflected on the screen. That's fine really because this gives great picutures when viewed on the computer. The camera is a little bulky, so don't expect it to fit into your pocket. Its not as huge as a DSLR though. It comes with a strap, 4AA batteries, a USB cord, a lens cap and a CD having nikon software. The only thing is it doesnt have a viewfinder. I thought it would, but it doesnt. For the price, you cant ask for better. Its ideal for taking good picutures without having something bad like a 3x zoom. The 15x zoom is great. However the only bad thing is video. Zooming on video is a big problem, and it comes out blur. Other than that, its great, has lots of features, though none are manual. Quality of pictures shouldnt be a concern. The quality is really great. The flash is awesome too. As I said, the only minus is the video capability. Otherwise a great cam :)""

Tech For Less has acknowledged receipt of the return shipment.  However the problem seems to be with AMAZON.COM and their billing/returns department. Amazon tells us that the credit has been sent to our credit card company (DISCOVER).  However in many calls to DISCOVER they tell us that AMAZON.COM has not been cooperative in any way in establishing this credit back to our account.  I would be totally wary of ordering anything further from AMAZON.COM.  Apparently they are having some internal problems.

We thought that we had found just what we wanted.  I found the pictures to be fuzzy if there was the slightest bit of movement.  I have had cheaper cameras that took more clear pictures.  At night while outside having a campfire, I tried to get some shots of our grandkids.  I put up the flash, turned on the flash; sometimes it flashed, but most of the time it did not.  The shots in which the flash had gone off were clearly better than the others.  It was quite irritating.  I missed a lot of great shots.

It is better than simpler 'point and shoot's, more affordable than digital SLR's, Nikon technology, great optics, and a 'user friendly' menu of options. If I were asked to describe this camera in one word, that word would be 'Nice'. As an afterthought, I wish it came with a Manual in the box instead of online.For the price, I don't believe you can find a better camera on the market.""
"20101116","2.0","Definitely not one of the Nikon's Better Ones! A clueless camera!","I am a Nikon guy and love my D90. I bought this L110 camera for my sister expecting great things from Nikon.First of all, this is not a camera that you start to shoot out of the box and expect great pictures. My first use was at night-time indoor light. To be frank, the camera was completely CLUELESS about the surrounding environment, even in Auto and Easy Auto modes. It would not use flash (with the flash raised) and would use a long exposure to take picture of the room (as if I am trying to photograph night landscape on a tripod!). And that means, blurry picture. The other point and shoots that I like, would know that it needed to use the flash and fast shutter speed in this condition.The Portrait mode (with red-eye turned off) eventually did the trick for me in low light conditions. In this mode, camera uses flash and proper shutter speed. But, every time I turn the camera on in Portrait mode, the red-eye reduction will automatically turn on (and pictures are not so good with that). So, I will have to disable red-eye every time I turn on the camera. And, yes, I will have to raise the flash too!This camera takes decent picture in daylight or on a tripod at lowlights... but, so does some really cheap brandless point and shoots. Not sure how Nikon decided to market this product. Mine is going back. Probably is going to settle for Samsung ZS7 or Canon 780IS.BTW. This camera looks and feels great! Thats the only thing I liked about this camera.Update: I just finished playing with my new Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7. Wow! What a camera! The best point and shoot I have ever used!!""
"20101115","5.0","Awesome camera","This camera took wonderful pics. The only downsize is the weight and size.I was really used to a point n shoot camera, so this is a bit larger and heavier.

In order to upload pictures to your computer you must have battery life in thecamera, that really annoyed me for a while. but other then those problems. its a great point and shoot camera.""
"20101113","4.0","I love everything about this camera except...","You can't plug it in to recharge the batteries! I bought the Sanyo Eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargable Batteries, w/ Charger. That way I can always have four batteries in my camera while four batteries are charging.Also, I notice some of the posts on this camera notice pictures being blurry and out of focus. If this is happening to you try setting the camera on Sport Continuous. That will stop your problem. I leave mine on Sport Continuous most of the time and get very good, clear shots.""
"20101110","5.0","Great camera, great price","I bought this camera a local department store before I found them online.  Amazon has a better price, but even for the price I paid it is a great value.  I wanted to buy a digital SLR but found they were a little more than I wanted to pay right now, but I needed a camera with more zoom than my pocket point and shoot.  I have a daughter in high school dance company and needed a camera that could take quality pictures of her when she is dancing on the football field or in the gym at a pep rally.  The Nikon L110 does the job nicely.  I got good, clear, crisp pictures of her on the field and in the gym. I also got some great video. The sound could be better though.  It might be better hooked up to the TV.  After reading some bad reviews on low light performance, I went around the house and took pictures without the flash, using different modes, trying to get a bad one and couldn't.  I even took a picture of my dog in a fairly dark room and got a decent image.  I also got a great shot of the moon without even using a tripod.  Other reviews complained of not having a manual mode or a viewfinder, but for me this is not a problem.  I'm not a good enough photographer to worry about that.  But I did see that the Nikon P100 has a mode for that if you are into it, and it's about $100 more.  So for the price, this is a great camera.  I'm thinking that the people with bad reviews might have just gotten a defective camera.  All in all, I think this is a great camera and a great price.Update:  I have ended up returning the camera for the Canon SX20is.  This Nikon still did take good pictures and great video,especially outside and inside in good light, but I found I wanted a little more control, as I am taking a photography class at the local college and wanted to learn more than what this camera has to offer.  Also, I began to experience what some other reviewers had issue with - after a few shots it will just freeze up and you can do nothing until you turn the camera off and then back on again.  Also, although only once, I turned the camera on and had a purple screen.  It would not go away until I turned it off and then back on again.  Also in comparison to the Canon - the colors on the screen were not as true and the Canon's.  But if you are looking for a point and shoot that is better than the compacts, this is still the one.Pros:  Camera not heavy at all, feels good in the hand  Large, bright LCD screen, I like that it takes AA batteriesCons:  Freezes up, sports mode only goes to 3mp, but does take pics fairly fast.Look for my review on the Canon SX20 IS""
"20101109","5.0","Nikon L110 Coolpix","I think that the Nikon Coolpix L110 is a beautiful, compact, and portable enough camera.  I was always interested in good cameras, and with its 15x optical zoom and 12.1 megapixels, this digital point and shoot camera would be perfect for anybody who would like a professional-quality camera without the professional DSLR camera price.  The menu features are extremely easy to use, without any complications, and it fits perfectly into your hands.  It takes 4 double-a sized batteries, and the ones that come with the camera last for over 800 pictures and 2 hours of video.  This camera is so simple and easy to use, and it has a good professional look to it.  It has a 5 way vibration reduction, so it has a very clear and identified image.  For you people with the shaking hands, this camera is perfect for you.  And to top it off, what about HD video recording?  This camera features a 720p High Definition video recording system with built-in stereo microphones mounted on the top.  This camera would be perfect for those of you who travel alot because this caamera also comes with a travel feature, which allows you to set a time when traveling through time zones.  On a scale of 1-10, my rating for this camera is about 200, yours may be higher.""

After some trial and error, realized that the portrait setting takes care of this issue and picture come out clear as a bell 99% of the time.  You can also use the sport setting which captures continuous frames and then go back and pick the best one.  Love the vidoe feature all wrapped up in a pretty portable camera.  We got the 16GB card with the reader insert so we could upload them easily into IPhoto.

Of course, a more expensive editing program (WMM is a free download) might have a converter built in.  But, that's my picture next to 'cheap' in your Funk 'n Wagnals.  The motion stabilization gizmos are great.  I routinely take video from my kayak, and the images are quite stable.  I wouldn't mind a lens cap built in somehow, but that's minor.  I like it.  The Nikon L22 (I had an L20) would be handy for sticking in your pocket, and it downloads into AVI.  But, I like the 110 just fine.""

"20100927","1.0","Exchanged mine for the Canon PowerShot XS130IS","I really wanted to like this camera. I loved the fact that it was a step in between an SLR and an Instamatic. The 15x Optical Zoom on a camera at this price is tantalizing. But the simple fact is that, like other reviewers, I couldn't get this camera to take a good photo. The pre-set scenes didn't seem sufficiently useful. I didn't like that you had to flip through menus to bring them up which is too time consuming for point-and-shoot. And you pretty much had to be shooting from a tripod to get a non-blurred photo. The color is extremely disappointing. The useability leaves something to be desired. The Vibration Reduction is worthless.I bought this camera to replace my Canon PowerShot SD780IS. But that camera took way better pictures. The color was brighter and I didn't have to be a robot to get a non-blurred image. So I exchanged the L110 for Canon's version of the same thing, the PowerShot XS130IS. Of course, that camera only has 12x zoom rather than 15x, but the set back in zoom is a worthy price to pay for better photo taking. In fact, the PowerShot XS130IS is much more usable than the L110 - it can go fully manual, it has a setting where you set the aperture and the camera determines the shutter speed or vice versa. Plus it has many more pre-set scenes than the L110. It has better face recognition than the L110. The color is much more vivid, especially when shooting in 'vivid' mode. Best of all, Canon's Image Stablizing software actually works and you can take a crystal clear picture. That's what I missed when I went from my SD780 to the L110. The PowerShot XS130IS is a way better camera for $10 less than the L110. Some say the L110 takes good photos if you know what you're doing. Here's the simple facts: (1) I couldn't get the L110 to take a good photo in any condition and I was able to take better photos with my SD780; (2) the PowerShot XS130 has triple the capability (again, it goes fully manual) and yet is still suited for quick, point-and-shoot photography. So, the PowerShot XS130 in my opinion is a true hybrid between the SLR and the Instamatic - I can take my time and have full control over the camera when I have the time and I can go fully instamatic when I'm just wanting everyday photos.""
"20100925","4.0","Good for price","Has been a great camera so far and a nice upgrade from my old Pentax Optio 555.Outdoors:1. Almost all cameras will take good outdoor pics during daylight and the L110 is no different. So far all my outdoor daytime pics have turned out clear and crisp with natural color. I've been pleased with the night pics I've taken, even when it's pitch black the flash brightens up the shot nicely so long as the subjects are close enough for the focus light to illuminate.2. Outdoor video looks good considering it's coming from a point n shoot camera and not a designated camcorder.Indoors:1. Like most cams it needs to fire flash in order to get clear pics with standard, indoor lighting. It has an Easy-Auto and Auto mode that will usually get the settings right, no manual mode though.2. Indoor video isn't impressive if the lighting is poor, especially if the camera or subject is moving very much. Having said that, the vid quality is better than most other point n shoot camera's video mode that I've seen.Pros:1. Price is good for features2. Takes good pics and video is reasonable for a point n shoot camera3. AA batteries are cheap, easy to find, and last a long time in this camera4. Nikon's Easy Auto Mode will have your grandma taking good pics5. Zoom is powerful (15x zoom)6. Camera firmware is easy to understand and responds fairly quickly7. Large 3' LCD8. Has quite a few Auto modes to choose from, or an Easy Auto Mode which will choose for you9. VR (vibration reduction) can be both optical and digital (hybrid) and works well10. Takes HD 720P 30fps video, perfect for YouTubers wanting to do their vlogs in HDCons:1. No manual mode (AE priority, etc), only auto modes2. Both Sports mode and Multi Shot 16 are nearly useless since the L110 drops the image quality down and turns the ISO up which makes the pics very grainy, especially in low light3. An integrated lens cap (like my Optio 555) would have been very nice4. No matter how large your memory card, you can only take 29min of video at a time (you can take multiple 29min vids though)5. Very little stereo separation in audio when in video mode6. In video mode, the microphone pics up the camera's motor when you zoom in/out (it's faint, but still there)Overall:I really like the camera and I would buy it again. I bought this camera mainly because it's a Nikon (had good luck with them), price, takes 12mp pics, has 15x zoom, optical VR and takes HD 720P vid. None of the L110's features are jaw droppers, but it works good and I only paid a little over $200 bucks for it.""

"20111119","1.0","I HATE THIS CAMERA!!!","This camera is recommended by Consumer Reports and has so many good reviews on Amazon. I have tried for over a year to get the hang of this camera, but it's hit or miss at best on any setting. The easy auto setting is mostly a disaster. I've had some luck with the backlight setting in night scenes. I just have missed so many pictures (blurriness or terrible color in the picture) that it's maddening. I almost never took a blurry picture with two lower priced Canon cameras that I owned previous to this. Now I'm surprised when I don't take a blurry picture.""

My other digital camera which I thought I can discard after I buy this NIKON coolpix L110, I think takes better pictures. I am, soo disappointed...My Samsung Infuse mobile phone takes better pics than this too...""
"20111029","2.0","Not a bad camera, but a bad EBay camera","Well, people certainly seem to love this camera.  I don't.  In fairness, it has many nice features which other reviewers have commented on.  The lens is unbelievable and getting 15x physical zoom on a camera this price is incredible, plus the image stabilization is very good and you can get clear shots without a tripod even at 15X.  The macro mode is very good although it occasionally gets confused with focusing and you can't get all the way in to the much-ballyhooed .4', but still, superb closeups are quite possible.  There are many other nice features that other reviewers have commented upon.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the performance of this camera in low-light conditions stinks.  I would say if you shoot primarily outdoors, you should seriously consider this camera.Unfortunately, I don't.  I bought this camera primarily to shoot indoor pictures for eBay and a good macro mode was mandatory.  Unfortunately, pretty much any indoor picture qualifies for 'low-light' unless you use the flash, which I don't because on this or any camera it gives pictures a very cold color balance.  My big, big complaint is that when you snap a shot, the colors of the picture you take come out differently than it looks on the screen.  This makes it impossible to decide what settings to use prior to taking the shot.  Trying to get the right colors on a picture becomes a matter of trial and error.  You shoot a picture, then you look at it, it's not right, you try a different setting, and go through the process all over again.  It's an arduous process if you have a still subject and are trying to achieve a certain look.  I find the built-in modes to be confusing and it's unclear what effect they will really have on the final picture, so once you start playing around with the modes, you are again back in the trial and error situation.  I wanted a camera that would take good pictures without much effort, and for the situation I am in, this is NOT the camera.  Outdoors where there's plenty of light and the zoom will be a lifesaver, it's a great camera.  But indoors, my wife has an Olympus Stylus that shoots reliably great pictures the first time with little effort (and it has an incredible macro mode too).  I'm sorry I got this camera.  It seems nice but for me it was ultimately disappointing and a huge time-waster.***** UPDATE *****Well, several months later and I have gotten quite good at finagling good pictures out of this camera indoors.  The white-balance function is the most important.  For indoor pictures, the 'fluorescent' and 'incandescent' modes seem quite effective in generating realistic colors under the appropriate light sources.  I generally have to avoid the 'auto' white-balance because it often changes its mind about what the appropriate white-balance is from one picture to the next, and it can cause consecutive pictures of the same subject to come out differently. On some occasions when none of the built-in white-balance modes seem to work right, the 'auto' sometimes seems to do the trick, so I do use it a little.The other thing that helps a lot is the exposure function.  Apparently they figured out that this was a crucial function people would have to mess with a lot to get good pictures out of their camera, so they gave it its own control directly on the back panel. I shoot a lot of pictures against a black background, and the subject consistently comes out overexposed unless I reduce the exposure significantly.So, basically I've learned to fiddle with the white balance and the exposure every time I shoot pictures for an auction, because different subjects often require different settings.  I stay away from 'smart auto' mode because it's not so smart as they wish it was.  And I do get some great pictures out of the thing now.  It wasn't worth the hundred hours of headbanging, hairpulling, reading the manual, and experimenting at great length, to get to this point.  So for shooting outdoors, buy this camera.  Otherwise, avoid.""

"20111002","1.0","I hate this camera","I do not like this camera for the following reasons:1) people mention that this camera is not good in low-light situations.  That is true.  in fact unless it is a broad, sunny day on the top of a mountain, the camera will likely, in auto-mode, revert to an incredibly slow film speed....we're talking 100 here...blurriness abounds.2) See number 1, We bought this camera to take pictures of our newborn child.  Of the ~10,000 pictures we have taken there are only a handful we are satisfied with.  Our best picture of our child was taken by someone else at a birthday party. with their camera.3) power on.  Although I just realized that there's a way around this, I hate having to take the lenscap off just to preview images.4) no manual options. just a bunch of presets a la fireworks, sunny day, portrait etc.5) not satisfied with the macro zoom...2 ft seems to be as close as we can get without the camera getting confused as to the distance to the subject.""
"20111001","2.0","Great zoom, but nothing else good about it","I am an amateur photographer, and was looking for something that wouldn't be too complicated to use, but that took good pictures. I saw the Nikon L110, read some reviews, and bought it. At first, I really liked it. The Nikon has an excellent zoom, and I was very impressed. A week after purchasing it, it lightly touched a table, and the lens broke. I took it back and got a replacement. A few days later, I took a few pictures of our dog in the sports mode. I looked at the pictures, and saw that they all looked like they had 'lines' if you will, through them! I have found that any time that I take a picture that requires sports mode, they all turn out with lines running straight through them. It is very frustrating, because I really enjoy taking action shots. I attempted to take pictures of flowers with the close-up mode. If you have any particle of dust, or fingerprint on the lens, that is all that you can see. It also takes blurry pictures. Also, if you don't have it on the right setting, it absolutely will NOT take a good picture. It turns out EXTREMELY blurry. Sometimes turning the camera off and back on helps, but it's very annoying considering this is a $200 camera. Needless to say, it has great zoom, and the video quality is very nice. But other than that, it's not worth the money.""
"20110928","5.0","great camera for the price","I received the camera for Christmas and have been taking videos and pictures since. The pictures turn out very good, but indoors you do need to use the flash or the colors come out weird. The video is good, but sounds aren't very loud. I have been using the standard settings. I haven't figured out yet how to do action pictures without getting blurry, but I guess it would help if I would read the rest of the manual.  All in all it is a good camera with lots of features.""
"20110909","4.0","Perfect for us!","We've had this camera for almost a year now.  We bought it a month before our son was born.  We wanted something that could take pictures of our baby quickly, without having to wait 5 min. for it to take the picture.  This camera takes very fast pictures.  It has great settings.  I love the close-up setting and have taken many awesome pics of flowers, leaves, bugs, etc.  It has a great zoom.  It doesn't get all blurry when you zoom in like a lot of other cameras do.  The only thing I don't like about this camera is that it is bulky and kind of heavy.  It no longer fits in my purse anymore.  I guess most of the bulk is from the 4 AA batteries that are used.  So, even though it is bulky, I like the fact that if the batteries die, they can be easily replaced instead of having to plug in and charge the battery.  This camera loads pics onto our Apple computer very well.  Overall we have loved this camera.  If you are looking for something that takes great, fast pics, and has an excellent zoom, this is the camera for you!""
"20110906","3.0","NOT TOTALLY SOLD ON THIS CAMERA YET","I have been using this camera for about 6 months now and have very mixed feelings about it.  The zoom on it is amazing and I have captured some awesome shots of wildlife, etc. I have also taken some beautiful close-up photos of flowers, etc. that are just gorgeous.  The thing that I am really having a lot of problems with are just the basic photos of everyday life when inside the house, etc.  I take a lot of photos of my family, friends, animals, etc. and  sometimes they turn out good, others times not so much.  They seem to turn out better during the day, rather than at night when lights are turned on inside the house.  Then they seem to look grainy and somewhat blurry.  What was a real disappointment was this past week-end when I left my little point and shoot camera at home and decided to take pics with this only because everyone always asks why I don't use it more for get togethers, etc.  I took it to my grandson's 1st birthday party which was held indoors and I am very disappointed in the way the pics turned out, wish I had taken my other camera for back-up.  The pics came out blurry and grainy and I missed some great shots because of trying to figure out why it wasn't working like I think it should have.  And forget asking someone to take pics for you if you want to be in the pic, they won't be used to it enough to know that your hands can't move at all or you'll have a blurry pic.  My father has the same exact camera and his is always attached to the tripod for this reason, he can't get clear pics without it.  One other little gripe I have with this camera was mentioned by someone else who reviewed this, to view photos you have to take the lens cap off, otherwise it will pop off.  I am now trying to find a point and shoot digital camera to purchase so that I will have a decent one to use when my granddaughter arrives in a week.  Like I mentioned before the zoom is great and it does have the capacity to take wonderful pics, but you really have to become accustomed to it so you know how to hold it, etc.  I was very impressed with the sport mode on this camera, it takes great action shots, one right after the other when you hold the button down. And I feel it is a great camera for the money. But, if you want a camera that you can just grab and shoot though, go with a compact digital.""
"20110815","3.0","Good hybrid camera","This is a nice looking middle of the line product. Its pretty easy to use. Zoom is of nice range. A couple of issues I have with this camera. It requires pretty good illumination fot it to take bright pictures. If the room is a little dark, the LCD starts grainy and pictures comes out less bright (yellowish) Flash is manually operated which is a hassle if you in a time senstive moment. Video quality is decent. Although not at par with other HD recorders. Even smartphone's HD video quality is better than this camera. Overall, although not a junk, Could have been better. Lot of room for improvement.""
"20100919","1.0","I should have listened...","I thought I was buying this camera for the 12MP, Nikon quality and excellent zoom, but I was disappointed.All the pictures are blurry if shot at 12MP, so I had to switch the settings to 8MP to get a good shot.  Waste of money.Easy Auto has never produced a good picture for me.  The shutter is always too slow and the light horrible.  The only time you can consistently get a good picture out of this camera is in natural light, which is nothing special for any camera.You cannot adjust the shutter speed, and the shutter is always too slow.  The closest you can get to adjusting the shutter speed is by adjusting the ISO, which still doesn't make much of a difference.It takes minutes of adjusting settings, white balance, light settings, ISO settings before the camera is even close to the right condition for shooting.Time between shots is really slow until you turn on the sports continuous mode.The flash is also a pain.  Just flipping it up will not turn it on.  You have to go into two menus and put it into flash setting besides flipping the flash up manually.The LCD screen is difficult to see in the sunlight, and of course, there is no view-finder.The zoom is really touchy.  You can never zoom just a little because of the huge range.The only thing I've liked about this camera is the battery life.  I have taken over 300 photos, left my camera on forever and taken videos too, but the batteries are still not even half-drained.Overall, I think this camera is meant to be an easy point-and-shoot with ridiculous amounts of zoom and no manual controls.  But it can't even perform as a no-frills camera.  I thought I was getting a good deal on this camera, but it ended up being a huge waste of money.I would never suggest this camera to anyone.""

This Nikon is a much better camera.""
"20100910","4.0","You won't be disappointed!","Let me start off by saying that I do not consider myself a photographer.  I primarily needed a camera to take pictures of the guitars I make and the cars I work on.  That being said, an SLR is a little overkill for what I am using this camera for.Pros - The image stabilizer makes it easy to use zoom and get a decent photo without using a tripod.  I've been able to get some very nice looking pictures both from all sorts of ranges.  I love the macro setting because I can really show off some of the fine details of my cars/guitars.  The LCD screen is also very nice and the zoom works great.Cons - I hate that you have to raise the flash manually.  I'm sure I will get used to it over time but my Fujifilm S1800 had a nifty little button that would pop the flash up by itself.  The biggest disappointment for me is that there's no view finder.  I found it easier to hold the camera steady if you can rest it against your face.  The S1800 also had a view finder.As you can see, I used to own a Fujifilm S1800 and you may think I liked it better than the L110.  Well, let's just say that the cons of the L110 are the only pros of the S1800.  I was not satisfied with the quality of pictures I was getting with the S1800 and then discovered that a close friend also owned an L110.  After giving the Nikon a try, I immediately sent my S1800 back and bought a Nikon.Overall - I'm very happy with my purchase.  I've been able to get some great shots of my cars as well as my guitars.  The quality isn't as clear as an SLR but what do you expect?  The camera is easy to use and has a ton of cool settings/features.  If you're looking to dabble into photography or just want a nice point and shoot, you won't be disappointed with the Nikon L110.""

I took my camera out to take some texture shots and reference shots and I was able to take a picture of the space needle from gas works park and it looks great. I was also able to take two photos of planes flying over the water and get pretty good detail.

"20100901","1.0","Blurry images and annoying features","I'm not a professional photographer, but as far as amateur point and click family photography goes, I've owned several digital cameras and have shot many family photos in all sorts of conditions and would also consider myself pretty tech savy. Of all the cameras I've ever used, the Nikon L110 is the most dissapointing. When I took the camera outside and shot still photos of birds and flowers, they came out beautifully. However, when trying to shoot pictures of my one year old in my house, images were consistenly coming out blurry and nothing I did fully remedied the problem. Some of the people who have given this camera positive reviews have suggested that perhaps those getting blurry images did not have it in auto mode, were not adjusting the white balance, etc. All I can say is that I tried all those things and more, went through the manual and read about all the features but could not find any setting that completely remedied the problem.The bottom line is when your toddler is doing something cute, you do not have time to scroll through menus adjusting various functions. To me, auto mode suggests that the camera automatically finds the best setting and takes the picture. The worst part is that, there is another setting called 'easy auto' that is supposed to do just that, but when I tried it the results were even worse. Sitting five feet away from my son in his high chair eating peas, with all the lights on, and the images were so blurry as to be unusable.A few other features were also annoying enough to mention: the lens cap is a seperate piece that you have to manually place on the lens rather than it automatically being covered when you turn the camera off. Ditto with the flash, you have to manually pop it out for flash pictures. And although some people might prefer this, I think its worth mentioning that it takes AA batteries rather than having a rechargeable unit (which is what I prefer- saves money and rechargeables have a longer life).""
"20100826","5.0","A great little camera.","The Nikon Coolpix L110 is a great little camera for people who are nervous about buying one of those 'confusing' and expensive DSLR's.  It takes fabulous pictures and at 12.1 megapixels, you can enlarge your photos to just about any size. The 15X zoom is nifty as well. The macro feature works pretty well, but you have to get pretty close for the autofocus to work. That can make shooting insects difficult (but not impossible though). There are many shooting modes like Sport, Landscape, Smart Portrait, and....you get the idea. The only mode that is missing is Manual mode, which may be a major con to some, but the only complaint I have is that you can't take time lapse shots due to lack of ability to change the shutter speed manually. I use my old camera for that. Oh well. For $200 I won't let that sour me to this camera (my old camera actually cost more). A minor con is that the flash doesn't flip up by itself when needed. The camera tells you to raise it, but I've found that it's just easier to raise it from the beginning. It just takes getting used to. No big deal. The last minor con is that the 3' LCD screen automatically shuts down after only 20 seconds or so and takes a few seconds to come back up when you hit a button. I missed a few shots due to that in the beginning, but I just started pressing the shutter button half way down periodically so I don't miss as many opportunities. There is no eyepiece or viewfinder on this camera either. You point and shoot through the LCD screen. I was worried about that, but I find that it hasn't effected my pictures at all. The screen is bright and clear. I found the neck strap to be limiting considering that you'll want the camera off your neck due to the point and shoot nature of it. I ditched it and spent ten bucks on a DSLR wrist strap. It's soooo much easier. I can't comment on the video feature because I haven't used it and have no intention of using it. I have a camcorder for that. LOL. The battery life is FANTASTIC! I use Energizer Ultimate lithiums (it takes 4) and I've shot over 800 shots and just got my first battery warning today. No complaints there. I recommend this camera highly if you're looking for a cheaper camera that still takes great pictures. I hope this review is helpful to most of you. I know I'm no scholar. I'll try to include some of my pictures if I can.""

"20100728","2.0","not up to expectations","I purchased this camera primarily for the Continuous Sport mode, since my son is an avid skateboarder.  The first set of photos I took came out fairly clear, but with an odd 'outline' around him (outdoors, dusk ~ 6pm).  I adjusted a few settings, and the next set came out well (outdoors, ~ 4pm, slightly cloudy).  At this point, I was pretty happy with the camera - I thought the number of images per second was very impressive, and I was pleased with the amount of shots that were taken.Unfortunately, things went downhill from there... Indoor birthday party photos (set to indoor mode, with and without flash) came out with an orange tone.  The next 2 sets of Sports Mode images were taken at indoor skateparks, and all of the images came out streaky.  After reviewing the manual, I realized I would only be able to use this mode in very limited situations.  Nikon recommends NOT using sports mode in basically any environment where you would watch or play sports -- bright sunlight, under bright indoor lights, under fluorescent lights, etc.  I suppose you need to be outdoors between 2-4pm, with the sun behind you, and with slight cloud cover to avoid any sort of glare. And forget about taking photos after the sun goes down - those were grainy and blurry.I'm extremely disappointed that this didn't work out.  I loved the size of it, and the shiny red body really made it stand out.  I was hoping this would be a good transition camera before entering the world of SLRs, but, unfortunately it didn't meet my needs.  I'm sending it back tomorrow morning.""

I didn't really even look at the directions, even with the video.  I was just playing around with it, trial and error.  Super easy and user friendly... So, if you want something user friendly, simple, with great attributes, this should do you nicely!  MUCH better then the Kodak!  UGH!!!""
"20100710","4.0","Nikon Coolpix L110","Had my Nikon L110 for about a month now and have taken almost a thousand pics according to the counter (of which about 700 are wonderful).  This camera takes wonderful pictures for a point and shoot, some of the best I have ever had.  The clarity and detail are awsome on all types of pics, but especially on close-ups (like of my wife's flowers).  My only complaint about the camera is with the ease of use.  You need to be familiar with the settings before you get good shots.  If on the wrong setting, images are very blurry.  I have missed some good shots because of that.  The other annoying thing is that the flash has to be manually raised to use.  That sucks since you need the flash for all pictures unless outside on a sunny day.  Missed a lot of good pics because of that, too.  However, now that I am familiar with the camera, I absolutly love it!!!  I would recommend this camera to anyone with some knowledge about picture taking and proper lighting.  I could also see, however, how someone with limited tech skills would never get the hang of it.""
"20100706","3.0","Not bad, not great...still on the fence.","I did a lot of homework before making this purchase, and my main issue is something that some have indicated before: On AUTO mode the camera will use flash when it doesn't need to or will not use it when it does.  Sometimes it will overexpose the picture because apparently it needs some time to process the lighting conditions before 'deciding' what to do with the flash.  It's odd, and makes you have to do a little more work on your own to get the picture right.  Also, what's up with having to pop up the flash manually?  What a dumb idea! Once you pick it up and shoot a picture you're half expecting the flash to just pop up or just go off....but no, you have to do it yourself.  I had a Konica Minolta Dimage Z20 before this and I think that one was so much more user friendly.All in all, it takes good pictures and videos, obviously, don't forget to buy at least an 8gb memory card.  But I tell you what, for this price I believe there are cheaper cameras that can take pictures at least as good as these.""

I used it for just three times and nothing happened, for example the camera dind't fall or something else like that!! I sent it to be repaired in authorized assintance in Brazil and they told me that the camera principal circuit was broken and it will cost more than the camera price (2 times more expensive). I live in Brazil and a friend of mine brought it to me from USA. The camera will be sent to USA as soon as possible to be repaired, but I will never buy a Nikon again. It was not a good experience and it has been a big trouble and wasted time and money. And I think that it is a big problem to a new camera that was used for just few times.""

Another really cool feature my wife fell in love with is the sports mode.  While you do sacrifice quality for quantity it will help insure you don't miss that perfect shot.  In sports mode the photos are 3MP instead of the usual 12 but they rapid fire at a rate depending on the speed you press the shutter release.  We are very pleased with the camera.

The video quality is OK, better than my previously owned camcorder with standard definition (320p), but is inferior to those with higher definition(e.g., 1080p). But it is sufficient for us.

"20100524","4.0","Good Value","If you want to move up from a pocket size point and shoot camera to one with a 15X zoom, this is a good choice.  The picture quality equals many point and shoot cameras, and the 15X zoom and anti-shake features allow you a great deal more flexibilty.  Without casting any negativity on reviewers who gave unfavorable ratings, I can only assume that they didn't set the camera on 'auto mode' which does permit you to set the flash mode, and allows some white balance compensation.  You can also pick Nikon's preset camera modes, but 'auto mode' works best.  Does the picture quality equal a digital slr camera? Of course not.  Are the quality of pictures equal to my Canon SD1000 point and shoot? Yes.  Is it priced like a 15X zoom digital slr? No.The camera's viewfinder/playback screen is one of the camera's other highlights.  It has a very high pixel count and is the same as one used on Nikon's higher priced digital camera.  The HD video recording approaches that of a mid priced HD camcorder.  I had NO problems playing back HD movies on any of my HD TVs, and I don't understand the complaints about poor picture quality, bad flash pictures, and poor HD video. I can only assume people didn't understand the directions, which aren't the best, left the camera in 'easy mode', which is how it is set out of the box, or they got defective units and simply should have exchanged them.  While this camera probably isn't exceptional in any one category, it performs very well across almost all categories and is a steal in the performance vs price segment.""

Finally this camera takes awful pictures focus on the center of the frame and blurred all around the center of focus. The 15X optical zoom wide could be the cause of the problem.""
"20100521","4.0","Great Camera for an "Average" User","I am not an SLR guy. But this Camera is great for the 'Above Average' Users. This is far better than a point and shoot camera.

An easy to use camera with 15X zoom, 12.1 MP resolution and less than $250... What else can I ask ???However at full zoom, I have to take the pictures very carefully. Even a little bit of shake of hands at full zoom spoils the pictures.Also the picture turns a little grainy at full zoom. Not so bad though.However I must admit that the 'Automatic Mode' captures the best pictures in all lights and all modes. I hardly need to use the manual settings. 'Automatic Mode' does it for me most of the time.""

"20100514","5.0","So far so GREAT!","My husband recently bought the Nikon CoolPix L110 for me from Amazon and I absolutely LOVE it! I have always had Nikons--over 25 years worth from a manual to an SLR to digital to this one!--and once again I can take pictures straight out of the box. It feels good in your hand, the controls are so easy and the photos are crystal clear. I have only had it for short while, so I have not tried out the video but I didn't buy the camera for video capabilities so I may not ever use it! I have yet to read the book but I will so I can take some creative shots.I broke the LCD screen on my Nikon CoolPix L15 (don't ever put them in your purse without a case!) so I initially thought I'd get another one like it until I saw the L110. The 15x zoom is absolutely wonderful, esp for taking wildlife shots, which is what I was lacking with the L15's 3x zoom.I wanted a Nikon L-series camera because it uses regular AA batteries (comes with 4 Energizer Lithiums!) which you can find anywhere, esp on vacation.The camera strap and lens cap strap that come with it are great--the lens cap strap is threaded with the camera strap so you cannot lose it, which is very nice, yet it is out of the way.I've taken quite a few macro shots both on the 'upclose' setting and on the standard 'portrait' setting and both work beautifully.The absolute ONLY thing I'd change on the camera is to color in that glowing orange dot for the record button--it makes you think the camera is 'on'.So far I haven't had any blurry pictures issues like some of the reviews here....""

I know that it seems pretty common these days, but we used to spend these same bucks for a 2 MP camera not so long ago.You can get fine images outta this, and fiddle with control to your heart's content.

I have a Canon 5D as my big, serious camera...and, yes, I despise the battery system on the little Nikon, and know that there is no chance of using interchangeable lenses.

The manual flash, a pain to remember to open when you are in a hurry to take a picture.No automatic orientation option to automatically rotate any pictures taken (when holding camera sideways to take pictures lengh-wise).  Must manually, picture by picture, rotate each one so that it appears appropriately in a slide show mode or picture viewing mode on camera or PC.  This is very inconvenient.Biggest con of all:  Picture quality is not great.  My 7 year old, outdated Kodak Z740 takes better quality pictures.  I experimented with all the auto settings, manual settings, etc. and rarely was able to get a crisp picture.  Photos look adequate on LCD, but when actually downloaded or printed - not vivid at all.

I went thru the manual completely, fiddled with all possible settings but no use. Image stabilization did not help at all. Quality was the same whether I shot it in indoor setting or outdoor setting. I read somewhere that the default settings in the Auto mode were not right. So chose a specific scene mode and shot photos. But no good. Even when I shot a stationary object in perfect outdoor lighting conditions, the image came out mildly blurry (that was still clearly visible to the naked eye). Also the video recording was grainy.

Overall, this is a really good buy, i would definitely recommend this to a friend.""
"20100327","5.0","Awesome little point and shoot!!!","This is an awesome little point and shoot camera.I purchased it because I needed something that would take really nice photos but could be easily slipped into my handbag whilst on vacation. My DSLR and lenses are a little bulky to be lugging around all day.My first choice after reading tons of reviews was the Canon SX20, mainly because I really didn't want to sacrifice a viewfinder, plus it had the HD video capability. But I have to get a hands on the product first and no stores in our area had one in stock.When I found the L110 was just being released I decided to give it a go....I have to admit I am impressed....this is a neat little camera. I've read some reviews where people are dissapointed that there aren't any manual settings, but the many preset features are really good for just about all conditions.One feature that I really like is the smart portrait setting - the camera will automatically shoot the pic when it detects a smile. This feature helped me get some of the cutest photos of our baby nephew. When I was trying on plain auto mode I missed the smile every time. Theres also a setting that will let you know if someone blinked with a pop up on screen warning. This certainly helps avoid those *would've been a great pic if only you hadn't blinked* photos that you notice hours after the event.As for digital zoom...I don't really like it on any camera...so chances are I won't use it unless absolutely necessary. But, I did try it out and found that using the full zoom capabilities you can get a pretty impressive photo of the moon, craters and all :o) (I'll post a photo I took of the moon with the L110) I did need to use a tripod though, because at that power zoom the camera shake was pretty bad. But it could be just me, I don't have the steadiest of hands.I also love that I can record HD video, even indoors in low light it's not really that bad when played on a HD TV. Outdoors in natural light it is pretty impressive. However, its not intended to replace a stand alone video camera so don't expect Hollywood results. Oh and the mic isn't ideally placed, but thats probably to minimize the recording of the lens movement when zooming (it already picks up on it so avoid zooming if possible)All in all its a great camera and I didn't really find any real cons to it. It definitely isn't a *pocket* camera, but its not bulky either, somewhere in the middle I'd say.Oh and as for battery life.....using either the optional recommended Nikon rechargeables, or the included energizer ultimates you won't be dissapointed, I just can't seem to get either of them to run out of power.""
"20100324","3.0","Great for stills, but not for video","I've had this camera for about 2 weeks and am very pleased.It has a host if auto settings suitable for most scenarios (They're not too difficult access or change quickly) but there is no manual mode. I haven't printed out any pictures yet, but everything on my computer monitor looks sharp and colorful.The battery life is quite respectable and the flash charges up quickly between shots.The L110 shoots good looking 720p video and you can zoom while recording. You may encounter some mild pumping from the auto focus. Nikon tells you upfront that shoot times are limited and there's a meter on the LCD with the remaining record time.Having a stereo microphone seems pointless if it's not pointing at the camera's subject - it's mounted on top, aiming upwards. The mic is only suitable for capturing ambient sound or to narrate as you shoot. I cannot recommend this camera for recording an interview, especially if they're more than arms distance away.""

It finally quit working 92 days after purchase.  Thankfully, Amazon let me return it as they had none in stock for replacement.  I then reviewed the NIKON L110 12MP 15x zoom and even though it was nearly $100 more than the L100 I got it.  Let me tell you, the L110 is really a pleasure to use and the pictures are GREAT.  I can not believe the differance and although its alittle pricey for a point and shoot its well worth it.  From day one I was taking great indoor shots even in low light.  The flash works great.  The video is cool as camera has stereo speakers.  If the L100 ever is avaiable again PLEASE don't buy it.

"20100306","2.0","Very Disappointed","I was so excited to get this camera originally to replace my older Canon. I have to say 90% of my photos come out blurry no matter which setting I use. The video comes out grainy. I do not like that fact that there is no manual viewfinder because when the sun is bright it can be hard to see the image in the digital one. Also where the playback button is located it is too easily bumped when trying to take a picture. I have only had this camera for about 4 months but I can't take it anymore and am looking to replace it.""
"20100220","5.0","Easy to use and fast camera. Cool pics!","I bought the L110 for the main purpose of taking pictures of my two kids. They are not still subjects and the L110 is doing a great job in keeping up the pace with them. It pops-up in like 2 seconds and is shooting rounds of pictures at max resolution (12.1). That's for speed.Wide angle and super-zoom are in the manual. What is impressive is that at max zoom (digital zoom included) - with no tripod - I get to take sharp pictures. That's for image stabilization.After ~500 pics and ~30 min of HD video, the original AA Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries are still fully functional. No warning yet.----Later edit. I took around- 1100 pictures with the original AA Energizer Ultimate Lithium (L91-FR6) batteries ([...]).- 400 pictures with some alcaline AA Energizer (LR6-E91-AM3) batteries ([...])- 500 pictures / recharge with some rechargeable Energizer AA 2450 mAh.All pictures were taken at maximum resolution and the flash fired for about 80% of those pics.----The stereo HD video recording under the same hood is a treat. The maximum length for one video session is 30 minute (regardless of SD capacity) which is decent for birthday parties and similar.Unfortunately, this is no camera phone that you can slip into a pocket until you need it. The only draw back I can see.I test drove both Nikon Coolpix L110 and Canon SX200IS before I decided on Nikon. Size is the only advantage of the compact vs bridge, although price is higher for that particular Canon.L110 is a stylish piece of equipment and an ergonomic one: I can easily operate it with only one hand.The menu is really simple and intuitive... even for the feminine intuition... :)All in all, a great camera and some well spent money.""

"20110727","4.0","Somewhat detailed review.","I think this camera was a great camera for the price i bought it for. Everyone i showed it to was very impressed and said it looked very professional. Its easy to get around the menus and settings, the zoom is in a nice place, it zooms well getting good shots but you have to have a fairly steady hand or i would suggest buying a tripod because this camera is not so forgiving in that aspect. When you are viewing a picture of something shiny like jewelry (or the sun), that has a bit of glare it has these lines of rainbow color vertical on the viewing screen. When you take the photo and are looking at it no lines are visible, the picture looks perfect. There is no view finder like the older style cameras have, which i would have liked.I like the variety of photo settings, there are the usual like landscape, sport, portrait but they added some unexpected ones like food and panorama assist for a panoramic view of say a wide sunset. Overall i really like this camera but i would also suggest buying a memory card since the camera only holds 16 pictures at a time.""

I'm happy with the pictures I took that didn't use the zoom or when I used the zoom and had a way to really steady the camera - my tripod I feel saved the pictures I took while cruising in Glacier National Park. The biggest downfall for the camera is the poor image stabilization (I hope I worded that correctly!) Many of the pix I took when I was standing still across a room show evidence of shaking. I don't see a problem with the pix I took in low light that other reviewers seem to see - the ones I did were cleared up using the photo problem on my computer.

But, despite the 'Great/Good' reviews, we have not been happy with the Nikon L110 at all. The quality of pictures are awful!  Very blurry and the color quality is not vibrant at all.

I bought this camera specifically for the sports continous function, so I could catch multiple pictures of my quick moving toddler without waiting for the camera to 'reset' between shots.  Photos taken in sports continous mode, even with a high speed memory card, are UNUSABLE. They are chalky with vertical white lines throughout the picture.Using other modes, it is extremely difficult to get a sharp photo.

"20110516","5.0","I think its worth buying","they made the new model but i think this is still worth buying because the difference between the two models is not enough to want to spend the extra money.this is a pretty good camera by my standards. its obvious that this is not an SLR so if you are looking for a cheap SLR alternative this is not it. the only real issues i have with this camera is taking photos in very dim light and taking photos with max zoom. these problems are easy to get around, by just switching between setting you can make the camera adjust itself to be more sensitive in dim light. a lot of people complain that they get blurry shots but its because they keep the camera in easy mode which makes the camera guess what scene mode it should be in and sometimes it guesses wrong. I keep mine in auto and pay attention to the shutter speed, if it becomes red then you need to raise the flash or change it to the proper scene mode. as for the problem with taking photos in max zoom.... i just walk closer to the object. over all i like this camera a lot and again if your looking for a cheap SLR alternative, nothing beats an SLR except a better SLR.""

I was excited to receive my camera to start taking great photos of my new little baby but I was so disappointed. I have had this camera for a while now and it seems that memorable moments I want to capture on film are lost because of the grainy appearance on the photo or the camera taking too long to locate the picture and focus. Before this camera, I owned a simple, small Sony camera and I hate to say but that one took WAY better pictures than this one. I really expected better, especially from a Nikon. My advice to you is keep on looking for a different camera. I am sure there is one on the market that won't give you such low quality photos.""

"20110415","5.0","Good value for under 2 hundred","First I should say I am a dinosaur, but this camera isn't at all hard to learn to use. The auto focus is a little bit tricky in wildlife photography, so read the parts on focus lock and such. The trick is to zoom in first and then trip the auto focus. Pics are superb with a wide difference between the 15X optical zoom and the 3X digital zoom. Seems to keep the pic from pixelating with the digital zoom only 3 power. Shoots beautiful sunsets and all. Overall an excellent choice for the person who wants a point-and-shoot but some flexibility to fine tune the shot. One more thing--a point and shoot is MUCH better off with a big body,Nicer processor, and a BIG LENS. Overall, I'm very happy. Don't fool around with the commercial camera cases. Harbor freight sells aluminum cases that work fine (make your own interior), and offer better protection for your camera.""

We personally find this annoying and expensive.- If you put it on auto and take pictures without the flash up (even if you dont need it) the shots come out blurry.Overall we are pretty happy with the camera.  We bought it when it first came out so it was a bit more expensive, but still not as much (or as complicated) as an SLR.

"20110328","5.0","Amazing Zoom!","I purchased this camera for our cruise to Alaska for one reason: the zoom. The zoom is everything I could ask for. You can zoom all the way in, click, and you have a perfect picture-on auto. No blurriness whatsoever without a tripod. I've never had a camera that could do that. I've also taken quick action shots of my dog running up a hill, no blurriness. The modes are easy to use and a lot of fun, especially portrait mode for some cute close-up shots. For a casual photographer who just wants some easy, beautiful shots, this is the perfect camera. Don't expect it to have the same options a manual camera will have. It's the perfect Nikon for a beginner who wants a camera with a great lens that's very user friendly. Battery life IS short, but it takes AA batteries which is AWESOME. I bought three sets of rechargeable batteries-they're much cheaper than buying a replacement battery for a camera that doesn't take regular batteries. Run out of rechargeable batteries and you don't have your charger with you? You can buy a set of AA for cheap anywhere and you're saved. Haven't used the video feature yet, but I have seen some videos others have made with it and the quality is excellent.""

The pictures will be blurry and the color will not be right. I sent the camera into Nikon and they replaced the lens and multiple other things which did nothing but leave me without a camera for a couple of weeks. I'm not kidding when I say that my IPhone 3GS takes much better pictures in low light than this camera.

"20110325","4.0","You can't go wrong for the price!","I needed a camera to capture my kids' activities and take vacation pictures.  I was looking for a good size digital camera that will shoot good quality pictures as well as withstand the rigors of parental handling.  I'm glad to say that the L110 did not disappoint.  The 'scene' selection feature took the guesswork out of the mix.  I actually have fun finding the best setting for indoor, outdoor and different weather and environmental situations.The weight and size of this camera helps me keep my shots steady.  The size of the base helps when it comes to using the timer.  I can easy place it on an even surface and run.  This is something I can't accomplish quickly with the small, dainty digital cameras.  The size of the LCD, lens and bulk also lends itself to a tripod.The best surprise for me was the quality of the video and sound I get from the L110.  I'm a professional TV producer and have used my share of highend broadcast cameras.  Let's just say I'm picky when it comes to video.  Again, for the price I paid, the video yield is excellent.  I just shot a video of my child's concert last night under indoor gym lights and it came out great.  The plus was the sound.  I really wish this camera had an audio output for a headset and a mic input.  But that's asking too much for the price.Of couse, it's not perfect.  The only gripe I have is the placement of the SD card slot in the battery compartment at the base.  It becomes a little cumbersome to remove and insert an SD card. But this is not a deal-breaker for me.  If you're a parent who wants a run-and-shoot digital camera, you can't go wrong with the L110.""
"20110322","5.0","Nikon L110 Review","I've been doing research on digital cameras for the past few weeks trying to decide which is the best for the money I was willing to spend.  I currently have a Canon A510 compact which I've had for about 5 years.  Its a great little camera but with only a 3X zoom and 3.2 MP, I felt as if I was missing out on some great pictures. To be honest, I'm not a professional photographer but I like taking vacation photos and lots of pictures and little videos of my grandchildren.After doing some research, I narrowed my search down to the Nikon L110 and the Canon SX130IS.  I really liked the Nikon L110 mainly because of the 15X zoom and 12.1 MP. About 2 weeks ago, I purchased the red Nikon L110 but returned it back to the store when I realized that someone had owned the camera before I did because all the settings were already in place and the batteries were missing.  I initially wanted to exchange it for one that hadn't been used but there were none left so I just got a refund.Today I went into Costco and much to my surprise, they were selling the L110 with a 4GB SD card and a camera case for very low price of $159.99 so I bought it again.  After setting it up I took some shots and they came out pretty good.  I even took some video which came out OK too.I am very happy with this camera because I realized that I could read camera reviews from now till eternity and will always read something bad about each and every one.  I decided to buy a camera that was in my price range that had the features I was looking for.  The Nikon L110 fits the bill perfectly.  Its a great looking point and shoot camera, is very responsive, and it's simple to operate.The only thing that I can fault on this camera is that you can definitely hear the clicking sound when you are zooming in and out while shooting video.  Since I have a separate compact video camera, this was not a deal breaker. Overall, this is a nice little camera for the price with some really good features.""
"20110322","5.0","Awesome buy","It took us a little bit to get the hang of taking pictures with such a great camera. You can point and shoot, or go manual if you like.  We love this camera and are learning newer features every time we use it!  It's a great buy!""

My kids play baseball and I am able to take close up pictures of them while they are on the field. This was the best gift i bought for myself. The quality of the pictures are good too.!! This is an amazing camera and you won't regret buying it!!""
"20110317","5.0","Love it so far!!!","Well, i had a Canon powershot sd 1400is and LOVED it, best little camera i have ever had.. but unfortunately it got stolen afew days ago and i have been so upset...my husband knew that i had been researching this camera the Nikon L110 and had ordered for my birthday whice is in April,but he gave it to me early since i was camera-less now. i'm not a photographer and don't plan to be i just love taking pictures of our 20 month old daughter, so this is what the nikon was going to be for and special events,the mountains, vactions (we are going to Hawii for Christmas) and things like that and use my Canon for when we went out with friends, bonfires, lake... things like that. BUT now that the canon is gone this is all have so i'm glad that it's not huge, but it's still fancy and takes amazing pictures, i think. The zoom is so good i can't wait to take some pictures at sunset and of the moon. anyways i just got it today my husband surprised me with it. I went right outside to test it on our dog and get some shots of our daugther, neither of them would stay still of course so i just messed around with the settings and figured they probably wouldn't turn out all that good the first time but i was wrong they turned out great, i zoomed in and took one of our dog running at me and it's so cute not even blury, i'm very happy with this little camera it's great! :)""
"20110310","4.0","Nikon L110 - Good for Bloggers","I bought this Nikon L110 camera at the end of December so I can use it to enjoy festivities with my family AND to replace my old Canon SD400 point and shoot camera. I have been very satisfied with it and used it many times for pictures.In terms of ease of use with navigation, the Nikon L110 is extremely easy to use and the option mode has enough features to let you explore different types of finishes (auto, black and white, portrait, etc). Once you get used to the Nikon options screen, it will be very easy to navigate through the features. I give it a 10/10 for navigation ease.As for the features of the camera, it is a bit above your traditional point and shoot because of the zoom lens. Beside looking like a DSLR camera, the fundamentals of the L110 is similiar to a traditonal point and shoot, but with better quality. I recommend reading the manual and blogs to get the most out of this camera because you can execute great quality images if you play around with the ISO speeds. I do a lot of macro shots since I'm a blogger and with the right lighting, your pictures will look great. It would be nice to change the aperture speeds, but I don't believe you can. I give the features a definite 8/10.I have not tested the video feature yet, but I do remember that it makes a humming noise when you reply. I'm not sure if this is because the camera is so sensitive, it captures air (crazy, right?) or it's just how it is. I wasn't too crazy about the battery part. It just seems kind of cheap to not have a charger pack for it, but over time I can see how convenient it can be if you ever need to replace them.In terms of value, it is an amazing value for what you get. I originally bought this camera for $199 on sale at Staples, and I bought the 'bundle' that went with it (camera bag, mini tripod, insurance for $40) and a memory card for $5 (2 gig), and I felt like I had all that I needed to have and it was a great investment for me because I can take quality pictures without having to splurge on a DSLR camera, especially since blogging is merely a hobby.Overall, this is nice lightweight camera that is portable and very easy to use. It stems above a tradtional point and shoot but picture quality is in the same range if you're not careful. It does tend to blur if you're not using flash, so it's best to have a steady hand when using. I really do like this camera a lot, and I'm still on the experimenting stage with it as I use this camera to capture objects in different lighting, surroundings, etc.Overall: 9/10If you want to look at pictures, head to my blog to check to them out.[...]All images after Jan 2011 were captured with the Nikon L110.""
"20110308","2.0","Missed the mark for me","I read the manual from front to back and took several hundred pictures with this camera over the weekend. The burst mode is quite good, something like 10 shots a second at low resolution. It seems like I barely dented the battery capacity with the included lithium AAs. Those were definitely pluses.However, 95% of the photos were noticeably blurry, even without any zoom, on the AUTO and EASY AUTO presets. I adjusted the ISO and 'scene' settings and got an unacceptably small level of improvement, along with considerable degradation in image quality.Subjects sitting down five feet from the camera came out inexplicably blurred, looking like they were about to make the leap to hyperspace, even with a flash. These were shots I thought were the simplest possible. Now perhaps there is some arcane tweak to the L110 settings I could have made to improve the results, but I tried.In the more demanding zoomed pictures, I expected some blur, and got it. My reaction was a big fat MEH. Perhaps with more practice those shots could be improved. But here's the tradeoff: a tiny Canon pocket point-and-shoot already works fine for 80% of the pictures I want to take. It would have aced my weekend shots, except for those involving big zoom, or burst mode. I don't see the point of owning a larger camera which is so finicky or ill-suited for basic shots when something smaller and simpler does the job better. And the successful zoom shots from the L110 were not that great anyway.Overall, I was underwhelmed. This L110 missed the mark and I sent it back (easily through Amazon). For about $20 more I'm buying a Panasonic Lumix model a year or two old but that gets consistently rave reviews. (Unfortunately Amazon was materially underbid on this transaction.)""
"20110308","4.0","great if you don't have the budget for a dslr","I bought this to tide me over until I can afford a Canon digital rebel and I might buy a Nikon now instead! Clear crisp photos as long as you have the right light. A little noise with low light and the videos isn't perfect, but if you want perfect video why use your point and shoot? GREAT for portraits!!!!! but don't forget to turn off the image stabilization if you are using a tripod! This camera feels great in your hand and is easy to use and even though there isn't a manual setting, you can change some of the auto settings, the rest you can do in photoshop anyways.""

I am still learning what all of the 'modes' are and what the camera will do but I am pleasantly surprised.Things I love about this camera is AA batteries, point and shoot with ease, LOVE LOVE LOVE the sports mode on it!Things I don't love - some of my pictures are blurry.If you don't have $700 - $1000 for a camera but can afford this one at $200 it would be the way to go.""

"20110221","3.0","Grainy photos","I've had the Nikon L110 for several months now and I still don't like this camera.  All my photos, whether on the computer or prints, are very grainy.  I set it on Automode and whether I use the flash or not, my pictures are still grainy. I've tried other settings but it doesn't seem to matter, I still get grainy photos and  forget taking pictures in low light.  I'm very sorry I ever bought this camera.  My little old point and shoot Canon took much better pictures but unfortunately it finally died on me.  I bought the Nikon because I wanted a good camera that took good point and shoot pictures.  I am extremely disappointed with this camera.""

"20110216","3.0","nikon coolpix L110","I haven't used it much yet, I purchased it for my trip to Italy in a months time. So far, I like it. The menu is a little difficult to manage, and wish there was one button just for type of picture I want to take. I hope after using more, I will have learned the correct sequence to access the menu. The zoom works great, and have a couple close shots that look clear and sharp. Also the battery door is a little difficult to snap shut.""

"20110215","5.0","1st Digital","This is my first digital camera, bought at the last minute for a 3 week trip to Mexico. Worked flawlessly and the pictures seem very high quality. Uses 4 AA batteries and they are still working after over 700 pictures, viewing, downloading, etc. Wasn't sure I would like not having a viewfinder but the screen is very easy to see, even in high light situations. Still have not figured how to make the flash work. Maybe I need to read the book. Even still, the indoor pics I took came out very nice. I am very pleased with my new camera.""
"20110212","5.0","Nice little magic camera","The L110 is just great! If you are a professional you will be disappointed; but if you aren't and wish to improve your photographer skills, then this is the one for you!! Takes a while to figure out all the options but they really help to get the pictures you want once you know how to use them... and the money you will pay for it is ridiculous!! BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT!!""
"20110202","1.0","Do not buy this camera.","I purchased this camera after reading reviews upon reviews of it. I read all the negative ones thinking 'How bad could it really be? I'm sure its user error.' Well as it turns out it is not. This camera was awful. After 3 days of owning it, hundreds of pictures and about a 3% success rate on getting the shot I was looking for I sent is back for a refund. The camera will not focus in zoom, I dont care who you are or what your taking a photo of it isn't going to happen, the camera will not focus with the macro lens on and the camera close to the subject of the photo. Camera performs horrible in low light conditions as well as any moving show you could want to take. It just did not hold up to the nikon name. Don't buy it. I ended up paying the extra money for a bridge camera, a canon sx30is, this is a camera that I would recommend!""
"20110202","5.0","I love this camera!","This was a new camera for me, replacing and upgrading from a 2005 Canon.  I am a point and shoot, basic photographer. My subjects are my 4 year old daughter and my pets. However, I also like to take pictures of the hawks that frequent my yard.  The Canon had a hideous shutter lag, just awful! And the picture quality wasn't keeping up with the demands of online photography products, like Christmas cards.  The shutter issue sent me to a Nikon product but I wanted a camera with great zoom.  I read a lot of reviews and decided the Coolpix L110 was the best choice for me.  Reviewers who are much better and knowledgable photographers have found this camera mediocre.  Well I don't.  I'm still figuring it all out but I'm very pleased with my purchase so far.  My number 1 concern was this camera would be too technically difficult for me to use.  Not true.  It has 2 auto functions, an easy auto and auto.  I had to watch a You Tube video  or two to figure my way around quickly.  I will read the directions but who wants to do that as soon as they open the box?  You want to take a picture first! The zoom is outstanding!  The picture quality is equally impressive.  There is a sports setting and I tried to get some motion shots of my daughter at her first dance lesson but all the photos blurred.  I'm sure it's me, not the camera but I say that to point out that there is a learning curve.  As you can see plainly from the pic of the camera, you are giving up easy portability with the camera - the only purse this camera will fit in is a large tote type bag, so my cross body purse leaves me out of luck.  However, the features of the camera outweigh the convenience of being able to put the camera in a shirt pocket. I have not tried the video feature on this camera yet.  We have a Flip, so that was not a  primary reason for purchase.  It's nice that it's there and I'm sure I'll try eventually but I can't weigh in on the quality of the feature.  I had to have the red one, from a purely female point of view.  wink wink).  And it is pretty.  Very happy and don't let all the features scare you away if you're a rank amateur.8 mos of experience later....  Well...I still like the camera but I have found some short falls.  The sports/motion setting creates grainy photos.  The auto settings are awful, you must use the other settings.  I like the wide array of choices for specific conditions and most settings are good.  The video function is minimal at best - 30 seconds is all I've managed to get.  The video is great, just too short. I'm bound and determined to make this camera work but it frustrates my husband.""
"20110202","5.0","Takes some getting used to","We've had to play with the camer a lot to figure out which settings are best for different situations. It's great outdoors, but we still can't get good indoor (low light) photos. I love the video and zoom! I don't like the Continuous Sports setting. Our kids are involved in several activities and this setting doesn't give us very good action shots indoors.""
"20110130","5.0","Love it","I bought this camera to use to take pictures of my kids and things. The camera works great The pictures are very clear and if you read the directions and work with the camera you can to learn to use it right. I recommend this camera.""
"20110130","3.0","Lense cap error","I purchased this camera for my Wife for Xmas. Only had it a month. We really like the camera, except recently when we turn it on we get the Lens Error Screen with or without the Lense cap on. Then the camera is stuck at that point and we can't use it.I did some research on the internet and found that Nikon probably won't honor this under the warranty and will say that we dropped it with the lens extended.(we didn't) I needed this camera for an event this weekend and was in a bind. I found a fix on the internet. If this happens to you. you  1. put the camera on it's back pointing toward the ceiling. 2. Hold the shutter button down. 3. turn the power on while holding the shutter button down. The camera will start up, the lens will extend and you can use it.""
"20110130","5.0","Amazing","This is a fantastic camera, takes a wide variety of pictures. The only real limitation is your imagination. Want to take an outdoor picture? Go outdoors and hit the button. Similar procedures for indoor pictures. Can also take videos which means potentially you can use this to make money or gain fame. Once videos are made you can easily send these off to America's Funniest Home Videos or Tosh.0. I guess you could go on youtube as well or other internets. The pictures can also be uploaded to facebook and then people can comment on them. All from one camera.If you were to travel back in time with this camera people would be amazed, however you wouldn't be able to do anything with the pictures but look at them on your camera as computers may not have yet been invented.""
