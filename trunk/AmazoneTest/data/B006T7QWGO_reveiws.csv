"20120610","5.0","Excellent value","Really happy with the quality of photos this camera produces. The features and controls are easy to use and menu navigation is simple.  It is a good camera for a beginner with DSLR or a weekend photographer, like myself.""

"20120515","3.0","I went through to many batteries","5/15/12 - I've only had it a few hours and alittle dissapointed. I hate it when people leave reviews after barely having a product but first impressions do matter. Anyways I was so excited to get my camera after having perfect reviews. I recieved it a day earlier than estimated which was awesome, ordered on Friday got it Tuesday! After reading the instructions I was ready to snap away. I installed the batteries and memory card. It kept giving me an error on the card even though it was the right kind. After about 2 hours of messing with it the batteries, the ones included, were dead. The batteries and the right side of the camera become very hot only after a half hour. I was iffy about getting a camera without a battery pack cause they never last long but I thought I would be able to take more than 5 pics. I ordered some lithium batteries and hope they are able to last longer and  I am able to take more pictures and get more use out of it to know if I really like it! I hope I remember to leave another review in a couple of weeks!5/16 - I ended up sending the camera back. I went through 8 AA batteries within 5 hours. It kept giving me a error message with my memory card, on random and nothing was wrong with it. Also the flash didn't work. Dissapointed. On the hunt for a few camera.""
"20120514","4.0","Great Price for a camera close to an entry-level DSLR","The camera is not an entry-level DSLR, but contains enough features that it will give you that feeling. It has more advanced features than a standard point and shoot. I like the fact that I can make manual adjustments for more complex shots. The focus takes some getting used to but for $200, it was a good purchase. I use it for fashion shoots and I get very good stills, but have not tried the video since I already use a High Definition camcorder for our video work. Since I have had it a very short time, will give better review when I have had time to play with it. BTW, very sturdy built like the more expensive SLR cameras that are out there.""
"20120402","4.0","great still camera","Just got this camera today, and have been running around the house taking photos in every condition that I can find. It works great and the 14mp is a great improvement from my 5mp and it works in almost any light. Now the video is not all that great the HD says you can only record a little over 9 minutes and the picture is not too steady without a tripod. I like to mount my camera on the dash of my car and take videos while I am driving, I guess for that I will have to go back to my old camcorder. The 24X zoom works great for still photos, I can read license plates from almost 1/4 mile away. For still photos, I would recommend this camera.""

I photograph birds in central Pennsylvania and needed a camera that was capable of taking quick shots while on the move. I had a Panasonic Lumix with an 18X zoom but wanted something a little stronger. The Fuji S4200 meets all of my requirements. I love the simplicity of the contols as well as their locations. Finally got the perfect shot of a tufted titmouse that was nearly fifty yards away. The only things I can gripe about are the location of the card slot which is inside the battery compartment and the strap holding lugs which are too small for a heavy padded camera strap. Did I mention the price which was low enough to counter the problems?""
"20120318","5.0","Good Camera for the right price...","I recently made a big change from a Fuji Finepix S9000 to this new model Finepix S4200.I like it show far. It's a bit easier to handle for me since I am disabled.This camera ismuch smaller than my old one. Only con I find is the blink setting. Even without peoplein the picture it says someone blinked. I just disabled it.My eyes disappear when I smile anyway.I am just getting to use it. Taking pictures daily to learn the new settings.This camera is very versatile does a lot of good things. Pictures look good so farI compare to my old camera pictures since there is a good difference of pixels.I would recommend it to people.""
"20120317","5.0","LOVE IT!","Was on the market for a new camera and found out that Kodak was not going to make them anymore, so I looked at this camera and a canon, was happy that this one was over a $100 cheaper and had better zoom and many options.  I have used it in several lightings and very happy with the results.  Can't wait to use it at my kids Spring concert.  Will update again then.  Great product.""
