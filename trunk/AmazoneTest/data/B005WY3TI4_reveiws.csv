"20120612","5.0","Best bang for your buck, hands down.","First off, if you've never used a gopro camera, and you do anything where a first person perspective would be fun to watch, you are missing out.  They are versatile, they can be mounted anywhere, and the quality in the Hero 2 is nothing shy of remarkable for it's size.I had a HD Hero, and when I got the HD Hero2, the difference was amazing. It's much more clear, and you can even install cinestyle (from technicolor) if you are using your GoPro in more serious edits, or you just want a more realistic color profile. The photos look okay, but I don't use that feature very much.I use the Hero2 for my daily bike commute. I also use it driving, and mountain biking. I've strapped it to my dog, mounted it on boom poles, filmed concerts, and so much more. I really can't speak highly enough of this product. Not to say that it doesn't have it's flaws... read on...In order to get the most out of the gopro, I've had to buy a lot of extras. I bought the chest mount, the helmet strap, the bar mount, the underwater casing, and the mic-input casing. The two biggest drawbacks are the fact that it needs special casing to look good under water, and to record external audio.Pros: versatility, video format/fps options, quality, cinestyle.Cons: On board audio is terrible-in order to use mic input special (non-waterproof)case must be purchased. Must have the underwater case to get good underwater footage. seems redundant.All in all despite these flaws I still give it 5 stars. for under $300 you won't find a more versatile camera that has the same quality.""

After that I told myself, never again.I now ride with a GoPro, to film and document my daily motorcycle commutes. It's also fun to bring along on weekend rides. It works great, I've had no issues with it, and I understand its limitations. For the price and for my use case, it can't be beat. Highly recommended.""

"20120201","4.0","Hero2 Review - Low Light","I've been looking for a camera to use in low light conditions, in partcular regarding cave exploration. I tested the GoPro2, Contour Roam, Contour 1080 and the Oregon Scientific ACT9K. I used a Magicshine MJ-872 LED headlamp and tested all of the cameras in my basement at varous lighting levels. The ACT9K performed the worst regarding video. Both the Contours performed the same, but the GoPro Hero2 performed the best. The video from the Hero2 had the least amount of noise/pixelation and the picture clarity was quite good. I ended up keeping the Hero2, but I have some reservations which is why I gave it only 4 stars. The audio performance of the Hero2 was more stiffled than the other cameras. Also, it is a bit more complication to operate than the other cameras. The Countour Roam was extremely easy to operate, and I generally prefer the cylinder shapes of the Contours and the ACT9K over the boxy looking Hero2. I would like to see GoPro offer a narrower field of view than 170 for other than 1080/30fps. A 170 degree field of view is a little too distored for my tastes. The competition offers a little more flexibility. If you are making a buying decision based on video performance in low light, then the Hero2 is your best choice. GoPro also offers a very strong line of mounting accessories, much better than the competitiors.""

"20120126","1.0","Blue/Orange Pictures","I've used my Hero2 camera twice and it's been nothing but problems both times.  I have it mounted on my snowmobile helmet and would like to use it to record video while riding then take scenery photos in between.  I've taken numerous pictures with it and they all turn out looking like blue/orange 'static'.  It takes good pictures when I'm at home in my living room but when I'm outside and the camera is cold the pictures never turn out...pretty worthless if you do winter sports.  My second complaint is the mounting/controls.  The controls are cumbersome to operate while the camera is mounted on your helmet.  The beeping sound is hard to hear if the machine is running so you can't tell if you're turning it on or off.  Half the time the camera is off when you want it on and vice versa.  Also, the camera shifts position after a short bit of riding and you end with videos looking out into space after you hit a few bumps.  The mounting bracket needs to be sturdier than a thumbscrew on a plastic pivot.  The final complaint is the service I've received over the 'static' pictures, it's been 3 days since I contacted them on the issue and still no response....This thing is getting returned and I'm trying one of the Contours.""

Unfortunately the box that Amazon sent me was obviously previously opened and the camera was definitely used.  The cables in the box were all jumbled up.  The camera started with movie #12 which means someone made 10 movies with it before I got it.  I know I can go through the hassle of returning it for exchange or refund.  The camera seems fine - no dead pixels or scratches on the lenses.  It looks like all the pieces are in the box.It just sucks that since GoPro pretty strongly controls prices I could have purchased the same thing locally for less money if you include shipping and I could have been sure it was new and unopened.We played with the camera a little yesterday and it takes pretty good movies - Amazing for its size - Easy to use - The ONLY thing I would suggest as an improvement is better night time ISO and offering a ball head bracket to make aiming the camera easier when using suction cup mount ....""

"20120120","5.0","Great if you know what your getting!","I think these little cameras are great.  It comes with a wide assortment of mounts that you can use.  I use the sticky mount on the top of my helmet because I think it gives a more open view than the side.  I plan on using the suction cup mount on my car, but haven't gotten around to it yet.  Heck I even filmed a nerf gun war my son and I did at the house.  Heck my dad thought it was a waste of money until he saw a video.  Now he wants to put it on his bass boat while its running wide open.  I haven't had the chance to take it under water yet.  I'm not sure about the other packages, but my package came with 2 cases.  Solid back (underwater)and a open back case that allows sound in.  The only downside is that you have to become good at using a video editor on your computer.  I use the basic windows movie maker, but I'm doing basic cutting down and adding music.  In my opinion it gives me the option to film stuff I always wanted to.  This camera is versatile with pleanty of mounting options.  I've read plenty of reviews of people making their own mount to get a different view.  I hope this review helps you make a decission.

"20120117","2.0","WARNING! Camera lost due to bad mounts","I lost my Hero during a mountain bike ride due to the handle bar mount breaking. I didn't notice that it was lost until almost the end of my ride. I went back through the trails but didn't find it. I also noticed that another part of the mount which I've used only once to mount it on my seat post was also coming apart. I did not crash or anything, but I guess the constant vibration caused the plastic mounts to eventually break. But aren't these cameras and mounts suppose to withstand such abuse? They advertise it as a go anywhere film your crazy rides and stunts camera. So I am very dissappointed at Gopro for not properly designing their mounts and/or not using the proper materials. Their support is also very slow and unresponsive. I couldn't find a phone number on their site but just an online form.I'm a mountain biker and I got the gopro Hero2 outdoor edition to film my rides. The camera itself is awesome. Really smooth and sharp HD footage. Although for some reason when left on to continually record, the numbering of the files go out of sync.I was thinking about buying a new one but until I know that they've addressed the mount issue i'm staying away.

"20120110","4.0","So far, mostly good.","I'd been using a couple tachyons in the past, one I lost in a lake, the second just didn't have the picture quality I wanted, so I decided to try the gopro hero2. (after watching that insanely adrenalizing hero 2 video on youtube :-O)First thing I'll say is I'm wayyy more happy with the amount of mounting equipment I received with this one. My tachyon(s) both pretty much came with a bracket the camera would clip into, along with some double sided velcro, not very practical imo for anything active.The hero2 comes with, among other things, a doubled banded head mount (like a headlamp), a bike harness mount, and a bunch of different shaped bases to attach the mount to. (for various curved surfaces) I went ahead and bought a chest harness as well, just the fact that it was available was nice.As far as video goes, honestly it's a step up from my higher res tachyon, but it still has some of the same issues, sound isn't very good by default (there's a stereo jack for that, but only usable when the camera is not in it's protective housing), and low light shots are grainy. That being said there are more options than I thought there would be, although I was disappointed that this doesn't shoot 1080p x 60fps, max at 1080p is 30fps. You can do 720p x 60, or 900+ (i forget exactly) x 48fps. I'm sure this is mentioned in the product description, so I'm not really mad about this. fyi at all three of those options I got around the same amount of video times with an 8 gig card, about 1hr 15m. I'd say get at least a 16gb if not 32gb if you're planning on shooting for a few hours.I did a test run walking around the house, 'pointing' my head at various objects while saying the name to see if the camera and my head movements were syncing up properly. I noticed when the camera felt centered, all the objects were down and right from where I thought they should be, probably because the lense is up and left from the center of the camera.. But when I took the camera outside and recorded things, everything lined up perfectly, so I'm not really sure this is an issue.Connecting to the pc was a breeze, I just popped in an sd card, and when I plugged in the camera, it opened in windows explorer pretty much like plugging in a usb drive. This is also how you charge the battery, and I was happy to see the gopro uses usb2 cables, which I have about 10 of. (I hate proprietary cables)Navigating the menu is a bit tedious with only 2 buttons, but still a step up having that little lcd screen there. There are plenty of options to choose from for all modes i.e. video, single shot, continous stills etc.After losing a helmet camera already, I was _extremely_ happy to see that the gopro comes with a little rubber safety ring you can install so the camera won't pop off. It already feels _very_ secure, but I'm all about taking every precaution.One thing I've learned already is to get video as exciting/quality as what you'll see on youtube, you'll need lots of footage, good lighting, and video skills. :) Presentation is everything!All in all, happy I got it, excited to try it out for future events!""

Don't get me wrong the video is amazing for what it is, and non moving objects that are close up are in focus, but objects at a distance are going to be a little grainy/un-focused.

I then tried to take a still photo, which turned out so blurry it was almost unrecognizable. The waterproof case completely muffles the sound recording ability and when you touch any of the buttons it results in an anoying crackling noise.  The only redeeming feature of this camera is that it has a cool waterproof case, but unless you only plan on using this camera in direct sunlight I would not buy it.  At $300 this basic 2-button POS camera is a complete waste of money.  You can buy a much cheaper 'real' video camera and put it in a plastic bag, and if it happens to get ruined go buy another one and be money ahead.""

"20111227","5.0","I love my hero2","The wide angle fisheye lens on the newer GoPros is really amazing.  I had owned and used one of the original hero cameras and this one just blows it away in every aspect. My one complaint is that for the most part if it is off for a while and you turn it on, it switches to photo mode instead of video mode despite the fact if you had set it to video mode and turned it off. This makes using it as a helmet cam somewhat difficult if you're never really sure what setting your camera is going to load into.  GoPro just released a new firmware update and some software that I have yet to use. Lets hope these will be able to cure a few of the Hero2's quirks..*update!!! actually I got really tired of this, so before I even posted my review I found a solution through contacting GoPro. In order to get the camera to go straight to video mode, just TAP the power button ONCE. Do NOT hold the button down like you would with the original GoPro cameras, but just a quick blip of the power button and it will come on in video mode... Awesome news. I really have nothing else to complain about except for the price of accessories. Nearly every single one of them you feel a bit ripped off especially after dropping 300 on the camera to find out you're probably going to spend at least another 100 or so on all the accessories you'll need.

Cases are $40 -- if you car about the quality of the audio, buy an external mic and drill a hole into the case to plug it in.  I will likely do this soon.The suction cup is so much stronger than I guessed ... the ones I've had for gps units could barely stick to a window, but this will grab onto anything that's fairly flat and hold tight.The battery life isn't quite what I'd hoped for (claimed 2.5 hours, but even recording only 5% of the time, I'm lucky if I got 1 hour at the race).  Bring a cord to charge it if you're going to be filming for very long.""
"20111220","4.0","Share your adventures","My family and I participate in may outdoor sports and I was tired of seeing my familiy's adventures through a view finder.  So I purchased this camera to film a charity bike ride that I was participating in with my daughter.  It worked very well.  I used the default setting and the image quality was great.  I took it out of the box, charge the camera and attached to my helmet with the included strap.  The sound was great and there wasn't any wind noise.  I have used a flip camera while skiing and the only thing I could hear is the wind rushing by.I had one issue the first time I used it.  Since it was on my helmet I could tell if I was taking pictures or movies.  I also couldn't tell if the unit was on or off.  The unit does beep when you turn it on and change functions but it is not easy to hear all the time.  GoPro is coming out with a remote unit to allow the user to control the functions while the unit is mounted. This should make it easier but more expensive.I recommend that you get an extra battery.  The battery runs out way before the memory does.  I followed the GoPro recommendation to get a large memory card.  If you are filming in 1080p you are going to need it.All considered I am happy with the camera and look forward to seeing the world outside a view finder""
"20111219","4.0","Great Cam","Thus far, this cam is pretty sweet.  The video is pretty solid.  The camera is easy enough to use.  I wish there was a Gopro sourced solution for the underwater blur.  I ended up getting the SRP Blurfix and it's fantastic.  I am giving this 4 stars due to the known fact that it blurs underwater and there is nothing for it... yet.  I know Gopro is saying they'll have something in the new year (2012) but still, this was a known issue with the first one too... so.. eh?To those complaining that this cam isn't as good as a $1000+ DSLR or the like, what are you talking about?  1) Go ahead and throw that cam in the water or drop it from a height of 6ft and let me know how that works out.  I am a photographer myself and I appreciate this camera for what it is.  I realize the video isn't going to be the supreme best, but if I wanted to take my pro DSLR cam underwater, that would set me back about $3k or so for a good case.  Eh, no thanks.  The video is really good for those moments when there is a high risk of damage.""

"20111210","1.0","Cheap chinese camcorder image quality!","No sure what is all that fuzz about the new GoPro HD Hero2.As a professional photographer I will put the GoPro HD2 on the same level as cheap chinese camcorders in terms of image quality. Very disappointing in my first test when using 1080P.Unless mine came with factory problems or it doesn't play well in Apple Quicktime codec, I can just imagine how bad should be the original GoPro if this later model totally fail in every in terms of image and sound quality. Low light recording is absolutelly impossible and even in medium lighted situation you can see a lot of artifacts in the image, including color distortions and lots of noise of all kinds.The only good side is that it's small and has acessories that let you mount it easily in almost any situation, including on a surfboard for what all versions include a waterproof case.But don't expect image quality to be not even near the big brands small point and shot cameras videos that can also do 1080p.GoPro is only good for small window size youtube videos and when recording in 60fps during a bright light day. Gorget about the advertised 1080p videos with this camera.If you are not after the small size and practical accessories line that GoPro offer, don't even think, go straight for a similar priced Sony, Nikon or Canon small point and shot cameras with 1080p video capabilities, you won't regret when it comes to image quality. GoPro HD Hero 2 should cost no more than U$100 for what it offers, it is nothing more than a toy!""

"20111208","1.0","They are amature cameras at best, for a price of professional!","Maybe the prototypes were really great, but somehow the final product has become a shadow of what was advertised. I work with wide spectrum of photo and video gear, such as Aiptek point-and-shoot, Canon SLRs, Sony, Hasselblad, Leaf digital backs, and others. Aiptek (around 100$) produced way better quality on my action sports skiing video shots.I used GoPro Hero2 recently. This does not seem to produce even 8 Megapixel shots at the appropriate settings (not mentioning 11 Megapixels)! Pixel noise is huge and color representation is poor. The color representation seems gray, flat, and dull... It is rather 20$ worth of production value, not a pro or semi-pro as advertised...The results are not professional, as advertised. A 100$ camera I used previously for the last 4 years takes better pictures. Looks like if GoPro used different processors to shoot their beautiful commercials! Or did they do substantial corrections during editing of their broadcast videos we all fall in love with?When the sensor on GoPro Hero2 gets warm (during battery charging), camera start to produce stripes and other artifacts, which don't go away if the camera is turned off and on again. This is the image on Flickr from my experience: [...] There are other images there too, showing my attempts to get the best out of this camera.A lot of plastic parts that ship with the camera are merely discarded and never used again. Does it seem wasteful? The rigging does not allow to tilt the camera up, while on harness. Perhaps there are other rigging parts, which need to be purchased the moment camera arrives.The wide angle is great. Unfortunately, and very disappointing, the real quality is nowhere near advertised.""

"20111201","5.0","Not suitable for underwater use (maybe)","I bought this camera specifically for use while I'm scuba diving.  The FAQ on the GoPro web site indicates that you might see slight blurring when used underwater as the lens isn't optimal for underwater use.  That is a significant understatement.  I tried this camera in a clean, clear pool, with plenty of light.  The still images are completely un-viewable -- it looks like someone speared something on the lens.  The video isn't much better.  It's not that there is a good viewing distance.  In fact, I took video while swimming at a stationary object starting at 20 ft away.  I didn't stop swimming until the camera was almost touching the object.  There was never a frame in the video that the object appeared sharp... or even in focus.It also appears that white balance is off when used under water.  In that same clean, clear pool, with plenty of light, I would expect that the images of an object in the water, taken from outside the water should appear to have the same colors as the images of the object taken from under the water.  But they don't.  It might simply be that the blur affect was causing other distortions...The fact that I was getting such sharp clear images while using the camera outside the water lead me to believe that reviews I read were over stated.  I mean seriously... this camera takes some awesome videos... outside the water.  There are videos from this camera on YouTube.  When I viewed those videos, I accepted that they were blurry because they were on YouTube... but to see such extreme blur in HD on my 55 inch TV... it was shocking!Update (12-7-2011):  I've purchased the MAKO Flat Lens ($21 + $3 s&h) and installed it according to the instructions.  One of the features claimed by the MAKO web site was that it wouldn't cause vignetting in the 1080p video or still images.  I re-read the claim... and realized that it doesn't actually claim this for the Hero2 camera.  In 1080p video mode and using 11m still images, I do see vignetting.  I'm going to try this out in a pool tonight and compare the video quality... and post an update.About the MAKO Flat Lens:  I'm a bit disappointed with the workmanship of this product.  The lens is actually created by laminating (gluing) two pieces together -- a flat disk and a machined flange.  The lens I got has bubbles and other imperfections between the flange and the disk.  Also, after removing the protective film (as directed by the installation instructions), I could see there were already scratches in the protected surface (how is that possible?).  I've taken some video using this new lens... For above water video, I think the stock lens is better.  I will likely buy an other enclosure to use out of the water.Update (12-8-2011):  OMG!  Underwater with the MAKO Flat Lens, the picture is incredible.  In my above note about the MAKO Flat Lens, and vignetting... Yes... you do see arches in the 4 corners of the video... and that's disappointing.  But the image quality is such that I didn't actually notice the arches until I looked for them.  The wide high definition video is so spectacular, I'm willing to loose a little clarity in the corners...  It would be awesome to be able to post some actual video in this review...""

I had the ContourHD 720 and 1080 versions and had problems with both that required RMAs.  To this day, my ContourHD 1080 stops recording after a short while.I borrowed a HD Hero from a friend for an extended ride & a few races and was incredibly happy with the results.  The camera was rock solid after getting banged around and the audio is light years better than the contour.  I bought a Hero2 for myself when it was released and it's everything I've expected it to be.  Accessories seem to be cheaper than the Contour as well.""
"20111128","5.0","Even better!","I use the HD Hero2 mainly to record cockpit video from inside the airplane I fly. I use the suction cup mount attached to the right passenger window. The wide POV makes sure nothing is missed out of frame. I also use a special audio cable to record the cockpit intercom and interactions with air traffic control to a Sony digital recorder (for my editing purposes, recording audio to a seperate device is better).I have been in digital video since 1992, and have used everything from 8, Hi8, DV and HDV. I currently use a Canon XH-A1 prosumer HDV camera for my business.This little camera is incredible in every way. It has met and surpassed all of my expectations, which are high. The GoPro people are obviously adrenaline and technology junkies, because this little camera fits both like a glove.I use Adobe Premiere Pro CS5 and have no problems importing or editing the footage. I import as native 1080.I have bought the suction cup and tripod mount, and both have worked great.There is a reason why this $299 camera is being used in Hollywood productions, right next to $30,000 professional cameras. It rocks.I really cannot understand people who give this camera anything less than four stars. I give it five stars, and if I could I would give it six.Stop sitting on the fence and go buy this camera. You will not regret it.""

I wouldn't even call it a Helmet Camera...I would call it an everything camera. As soon as I unboxed my camera I charged it. It was fully charged in 20 minutes (just about how long it took me to read the instructions) since it comes with a factory charge on the battery, which in my world is the best because you can immediately play with it right out of the box. The first video I took was from inside my 55 gallon aquarium. I plopped the camera in the water and I had all my fish swimming around it. When I took my camera out of the water I noticed that all the water just beads right off the lens. Really nice especially if your going in and out of water. I pulled the footage right off my camera without a hitch. (No special program needed to do that which is really nice...now just try to convince my samsung camcorder to do the same thing.) The footage was a little grainy but that was due to poor lighting since I use a actinic blulight for my reef. I can't wait for tomorrow where I can actually use it to its full potential. I already found a way to mount it to my 450 r/c heli so I cant wait to see my house at 1080p from 50 ft up! Tomorrow is just gonna be a day of extreme sports: Dirtbiking, longboarding, skateboarding, parcor, etc. The biggest pro I found with this camera was the weight and size. I just love how small it is and how light it is...perfect for my heli! As of right now there is no cons. If your on the fence about getting one...DO IT!!!""

"20111112","4.0","Great when used with sufficient lighting","Pros:1. Pretty good quality video (noticably better than the video quality of an iphone4)2. Burst mode is pretty nice. Works exactly as advertised. Captures high-speed shots nicely.3. Waterproof case is amazing. This camera would work VERY well for scuba diving or snorkeling.4. While I have not tried it outmyself in video editing, the 120 fps mode at WVGA could be pretty handy for high-speed video as well where HD isn't an issue.5. if HD is an issue, 720p@60 fps is nice and silky smooth.Cons:1. No flash of any kind, when taking pictures indoors, the quality/blurryness will be the equivalent of a point and shoot camera without the flash.2. When waterproof case is on with waterproof door, VERY little sound can be heard in regards to talking/ambient noise (could be a pro depending on your goal I suppose)3. Currently only 1080p@30fps has the option to select FOV. all other options are stuck at 'wide'. When taking 'normal videos' indoors, the wide setting makes the edges of the video look quite curved.Overall this is a quality unit and a nice addition for anyone who likes to take video while outdoors and doesn't want to risk damaging a more standard camera/camcorder.""
"20111110","4.0","Better than the Original HD","(Update 6/6/2012) GoPro finally released the new diving case which fixes the infamous underwater focus problem with the standard waterproof case after two years of long wait for some users. The diving case will cost $49 that is a great price, but it is extra. Anyway, all my comments regarding the underwater problem should not be a concern with the new diving case.(Update 5/21/2012) I got the new diving case from GoPro. Although it cannot attach any filter, it is still great. I like the lens cover that came with it too. I can also see tiny bid less fish-eye effect and wider angle on land. That is nice IMO. I am giving 4 stars because they have the fix now even though I needed to spend extra $49. The diving case is that good.After all these issues / promises are solved and updated, I will give this product 5 starts.1. (Fixed!!!)Underwater focus fix with Extra $49.2. 127FOV and 90FOV for 720P as promised3. Overheating issue and short battery life4. Price is still too much for such low quality materials used in this product.5. This was not expected, but as they promised 'Pro-tune' firmware update will be released in this summer, not in summer 2015 like the diving case that GoPro promised long time ago.6. Bugs in low light videos and photos. Timelapse photo bugs.Quick Summary:Hero2 is clearly better than the original HD Hero in many areas. The price difference is justifiable although $300 was bit too much for my wallet. I am still happy with the purchase. If you are choosing between Original HD Hero and Hero2, I would get Hero2 for better low light performance. I would not use this camera for photos like point and shoot cameras unless there is lots of light and steady mount to take time-lapse photos. (Update 3/16/2012) My GoPro Hero 2 is broken now from getting wet. GoPro HD Hero 1 and 2 both have underwater focus issue. In order for the camera to work underwater, you need to modify the case with some flat lens. FYI: Modifying GoPro cases voids the warranty.Video Quality: ***** (Amazing)Photo Quality: * (iPhone is much better unless you need fisheye look)Built Quality: ** (Cheap plastic body, but the case is sturdy)Fun Factor: ***** (Can mount on anything. Very versatile)Easy To Use: *** (It is easy to use, but hard to configure)Underwater Video: * (Horrible)Underwater Video w/ Flat Lens: *** (Great, but modifying a case with some flat lens voids the warranty)Value: *** ($300 is pretty expensive)(Update 2/21/2012) I started seeing some disappointments from reviews regarding underwater focus and photo quality issues. The underwater focus issue is pretty disappointing, but there are many quality solutions from other vendors as little as $22. GoPro is almost ready to release the new diving case. IMHO, GoPro2 with a flat lens option produces amazing underwater result. I first thought $300 was too much for such plasticky cheap looking camera, but the performance is there as long as you know its quirks. I have not found any better solutions under $500 to shoot wide angle underwater video. For underwater macro video and photo, a point and shoot camera with an underwater case works better. If you are thinking about replacing your point and shoot camera with GoPro, you might not like this camera. This is pretty much the best wearable/mountable action/helmet camera that has different purpose than Point and shoot cameras. I use DSLR, Mirrorless (CSC), Point and shoot, and Action/Helmet (GoPro) cameras all for different purposes. If you shoot more photos and do not wear a camera on you, Panasonic TS3, TS4, and Nikon AW100 suit your need although they can not do time lapse (except TS4).Pros Over the Original HD Hero:* (Update 2/20/2012) Addictively fun camera to use once I understood the quirks.* low light. Especially at 60fps in low light, I see huge difference.* Video is sharper. I am not sure about 2X though.* Auto White balance is much better in low light.* The Running LED light on the back side. I do not care about the top and bottom ones.* Motion is clearer and less motion blur due to faster shutter speed I think.* Auto Exposure is more accurate.* Improved dynamic range. I see good detail in shadow areas.* Config LCD is easier to use.* 120fps!* I can use the same protective cases and mounts on Hero2.* And other neat features like 10fps photos and more.Pros Over Other Action Cameras like Contour HD series, Tachyon HD series, Bullet HD series, Midland XTC series, and Oregon Scientific ATC-9K* (Update 2/21/2012) The waterproof case is amazing and inexpensive to buy extra. I had to drill a hole in one of the cases for mic jack. When I checked the hole, the wall was very thick and strong. I am extremely confident to take the camera anywhere!* Most action cameras use microSD card which is little more expensive and easy to lose. GoPro sticks with Full SD card. That is great!* There are other action cameras that are on par with the original HD, but this Hero2 is one step ahead of other competitors. There are no better action cameras in terms of video quality than Hero2 as of 11/10/2011.* As far as I have seen videos of other products, Hero2 handles the best in high contrast scene and low light.* Rolling shutter issue seems well controlled compared to other cameras.Cons Over the Original HD Hero (Update 5/8/2012):* Battery does not last as long as the original HD. Hero 2 @ 720P/60fps lasts max 1.5 hours with a new battery in optimal temperature. Usually it will stop recording in less than 1.25 hours. I am expecting 1 hour, so that I can plan my recording.* I keep repeating myself, but Hero 2 gets very very very hot. Make sure no small children touch the camera while recording without a case.* More bugs. Newer products usually have some software issues, but Hero 2 has many. Occasional lock-ups. Strange streaks in photos. Half of one picture in different exposure. Losing some color. In low light video, there are two strange lines showing up. There are more issues I have experienced, but I have to ignore. I guess it is because working-around issues are also part of fun for GoPro users.Temporary Cons (Gopro says a new firmware will fix the following items):* No support for 127 and 90 FOV at 720P even though that was specified.* 3D is not supported yet. (Update 2/20/2012: 3D has been supported via firmware update)Cons:* (Update 4/2/2012) Overheat Problem. Now that I broke my Hero 2 by getting it wet, I am bit scared to use it underwater. I tried one of my newly purchased hero 2s to film in a room at 75F degree temperature with the case and LCD backpack. It overheated in 30 minutes and shut itself down. I saw the overheating icon on the LCD screen. The camera and the SD card were very very hot.* (Update 4/2/2012) Much more noises toward end of video due to excessive heat with the case and LCD backpac. After I was getting the overheating issue with one of my Hero 2 (I now have two hero 2s and one hero 1). I started testing all my GoPro cameras. Hero 1 got hot, but it was not as bad as hero 2. I tested my two Hero 2s recording at 720P/60FPS for 30 minutes on a tripod. Both of my Hero 2 cameras took excellent noise free footage at first few minutes. However, towards the end, both cameras recorded pretty noisy footage that I am sure that came from the excessive heat. I know many cameras overheat recording long period of time, but Hero 2 seems little too easy to get that hot. I did not realize this noise issue since I have been using it underwater exclusively in very cold water. Without LCD backpac, they run little cooler, but they still get very hot.* (Update 2/20/2012) While recording or not recording for about 1 hour, the camera body gets super hot. I can understand when recording, but if I am not recording, it should not get that hot and drain battery. I have to make sure I turn it off when I am not recording. I now use automatic shut-off.* (Update 2/20/2012) Using the external mic jack with nice powered mics still gets too low volume. I can increase volume level in post-process by adding 10db-15db to get better sound quality than the internal mic though.* (Update 2/20/2012) It is very addictive. I bought all sorts of accessories for it that ended up costing more than some nice DSLR cameras.* Flimsy battery cover.* Built quality is good, but for $300, they can do better IMO.* No in-camera exposure adjustments like Contour HD.* Config LCD is better than the original, but it is still hard to adjust.* No underwater lens or case option that fixes the underwater blur issue directly from Gopro. There are 3rd party options available, but they are not perfect. They are either too big or have vignetting at 170. If GoPro is putting underwater footage on their boxes and the promo-videos, they should provide some kind of underwater solution.* 120fps is great, but you need lots of light. Well I guess we knew that.* As we know, this is not an indoor camera. Even though video is pretty good indoor, photos are pretty noisy and blurry due to use of slow shutter speed. For time-lapse movies, slow shutter and motion blur are welcome though.* Audio is still not good as the Original HD Hero. There is a stereo mic jack, but to use it, we have to buy another special case that has a opening on the side.* Price. There are no other action/wearable cameras better than Gopro HD Hero2 at this time, so the price can be justified. However, when I look at Panasonic TS3 at $260 with metal body, GPS, and all the other features, huh... this is a pretty expensive plastic camera that has only two buttons from China. I am sure the profit margin on this camera is huge!Wish list:* Standard 1/4' 20tpi thread on the body would be nice.* Different color bodies. It is not a big deal, but I would like it in black or camu for hunting and fishing.* Electric or Software Image Stabilization: I see other cheaper video cameras have this feature. Any action cameras without it disparately need image stabilized, so viewers do not get motion sickness.* A small Built-in LCD for liveview and playback would be nice. The LCD Backpac makes the camera too thick.* Would like to know how to shoot and edit a video like the Hero2 promotional video!Workarounds:* (Update 2/20/2012) Unfortunately, GoPro has not released their underwater housing to solve the blur issue (ETA in April). There are quality workarounds from other vendors. The best option is 'blurfix'. The second best IMO are 'Pursuit Glass Flat Lens' and 'eyeofmine flat lens housing'. The cheapest solution is 'mako flat lens'.* (Update 2/20/2012) Sometimes GoPro2 takes very dark and underexposed images (almost black) in time lapse mode. I found that the use of 1 second or faster interval can cause the issue even in slight low light condition. If you give GoPro 2 at least two second interval, GoPro2 has enough time to process and use 1/2 sec shutter speed to get some what right exposure.* (Update 2/20/2012) Not so good indoor photo quality is due to use of 1/2 sec shutter speed almost all time in low light condition. Since I know that now, I do not use the camera handheld indoor. I always make sure I mount on something for steady shots.Tip:* (Update 3/4/2012) The best setup for fast action scenes is 720P/60fps/170FOV. I had hard time post-processing 1080P footage since the CMOS rolling shutter issue got exaggerated from camera shakes. If I can mount my gopro on a steady tripod, then I will switch to 1080P. When I am wearing it on me, I only use 720P/60fps/170FOV to avoid the rolling shutter problem. I had to use 1080P mode most of the time using the Original Hero HD because 60FPS in the old GoPro HD had pretty bad low light performance. HD2's 60fps performs really good in low light situation.Non-scientific Test:I compared the original GoPro HD Hero@1080P/127 and Hero2@1080P/170 against Nikon D7000@1080P with 8mm Fisheye lens@F3.5 in low light condition. Original GoPro could not capture most of the low light scene. GoPro Hero2 got it fine, but it was bit noisier than D7000. Assuming D7000 has jerky motion at 24fps, overall I liked Hero2's color rendition better than D7000.(Update 3/16/2012) Broke My GoPro 2:It is my first time to break an underwater camera in at least 100 dives while taking videos with several cameras. My GoPro Hero HD 2 case got some moisture inside, and it does not turn on with a fully charged battery. The case was not flooded, but I guess GoPro or digital cameras in general are pretty sensitive electronic devices. I understand when cameras get wet, they break, and manufactures cannot help. I trusted my GoPro case, but GoPro told me the cause of moisture getting inside was more likely use of a flat lens on my GoPro case. I never had issue with two of my flat lenses before. We are not supposed to modify GoPro cases to use the camera underwater if we want to retain the warranty. I should have known that. GoPro is not saying anything wrong here. They are right. However, my point is 'How can we take underwater videos using GoPros without modification?' I know GoPro has a promotional video using modified cases. I just wanted to apologize for recommending third party flat lens options here on Amazon. You do not want to modify GoPro cases, and I now recommend not to use GoPros underwater unless you can live with blurry video footage or no warranties. The GoPro support person was not bad. He was doing his job making sure I modified the lens, so it is not GoPro's fault. As far as I investigated why my camera got moisture inside is that GoPro cases are not all made the same. Thier manufacture torallance is not tight. I have four cases that they all seem to have different tightness when closing the case door. Anyway, if you are going to use it underwater, make sure to test the case before use.I still like GoPro2's excellent video quality. I also invested too much on several GoPros, mounts and cases, so I am getting it again from freedivingspearfishinggear.com, where I got my flat lens from. The person there really tried helping me on this issue. He did actually help me more than GoPro support (GoPro offered me some discount on a new camera as long as I returned the bad camera). The GoPro support kept the 24 hour reply policy. It is unfortunate that GoPro does not have a service department that can repair cameras. My GoPro2 works fine when connected to USB. It does not work with any of my three batteries (Fully charged using my other GoPro). I feel like it can be repaired, but I guess a new camera is much cheaper than repairing labor cost for them. Even though you scratch your GoPro lens (the actual lens on the body), GoPro will not replace with a new lens that is not expensive at all. Instead, they will give you some discount on a new GoPro that still cost much more than just a new lens.If I can go back in time, I would start all over with Contour since their cameras are all weatherproof just by themselves. Contour Roam is waterproof. Contour has some of thier own quirks with thier cameras. Contour video quality is not as good as GoPro Hero 2. However, I am not a professional and cannot afford insurance on my equipments. I now feel much better with a weatherproof body and a waterproof case combination. With Contour + underwater case, I do not have to buy an expensive flat lens and modify a case to void warranty!I am downgrading from 4 stars to 3 stars because GoPro does not have any phone support. GoPro does not have a service department that can repair cameras with fee basis. Despite I defended the underwater issue last month, If GoPro does not allow modification with flat lenes, they should not promote underwater videos. Lastly, GoPro cases are made strong, but they are not all made exactly the same. This is also a known issue.""
"20111110","5.0","Perfection","I purchased my Hero HD Motorsports at HumbleOutdoors for about $270, it came with free extra battery.I used the original Hero on my 1954 Chris Craft, this updated version has many neat new features. The menu is so much simpler to operate - no codes are gone!  Multible LED's on top, front and bottom are more intuitive, higher res for photo images and a multi photo burst mode. I really had fun with the slow mo feature, great for the hull slapping against the heavy lake chop.The GoPro Hero lineup, is the best hands down. The price point is incredible.""
"20111109","2.0","Defective","My new GoPro Hero 2 Outdoor edition with LCD Backpac never worked properly. My still photos were usually only vertical lines and most of my video was black. Quite disappointing when that time lapse or video I just worked on is completly scrambled. Maybe I should have just returned it.The reply from tech support was a form letter blaming the poor performance on my SD card. I read the EXACT SAME reply sent to another customer posted on a GoPro user forum.After numerous format / power cycling procedures I could get it to work, but after powering off the camera it would fail all over again.I tried 3 different cards, all of which work great in my Canon S95 and XA10 cameras.Tech support issued an RMA number and I shipped the unit at my expense to the factory. I am waiting . . .I am also unhappy because one of the buckles on the helmet strap broke with very little force.As for the audio/video performance - it is usable. Obviously it can not compare to my S95, 7D or XA10. Low light images are really bad. The audio is even worse. There is a constant 'rattling' sound. The only use for the audio is as a sync reference in a multi-cam shoot.The strength lies in it's small form and rugged housing. I am looking forward to experimenting with it in places no other camera can go.......UPDATE Nov 29 2011The camera has been shipped back to me. The problem was with the LCD backpack which was replaced. So far all is functioning well. GoPro's shipping to me took 10 days from SF to MPLS via USPS. Not sure what the delay was, but that is ridiculous.One additional negative comment is the packaging. It is in excess.I have raised my rating from 1 to 2 stars. All things considered, I wish I would have returned it in the first place.""

I'd rate this as still fairly confusing, with a lot of options and no obvious way to set your choices and leave the steep slopes of the menu tunnel you'll be spelunking your way through.

I have no way of knowing if it was simply opened and not used, or if it was used for the full 30-day return period. It was obvious that is was opened because it was no longer in 'Shrinked-Wraped' plastic but instead a plastic bag. Original cardboard box was torn in a few places.

We also purchased the wrist housing so we could use the camera while scuba diving.  At some point we will get a housing that has a light source so we can take better pictures at depth.  Having said that, we were happy with what it took.  Our only complaint is that we cannot play the videos back on our current computers because they're a dated and don't support the video software, wish we would have known that before purchasing the camera.  We were able to use a friend's computer to view them though.  The friend has the same camera with the housing that has lights and there is a difference between ours and theirs but ours was still decent.

"20120529","1.0","Seriously flawed camera","Purchased the Hero2 18 April 2012, with a video BacPac. It seemed to work. Then, this Memorial weekend, I shot a few shots at the beach and turned the camera off. It refused to turn back on.I brought it home. It appeared bricked. If I plugged it in to a USB outlet, it said it was unrecognized.Finally, I removed the battery, the Bacpac and the card. Eventually, after reinstalling the battery, it finally started. If I plugged in the USB cable, it mounted. However, if I unmounted the camera from the USB cable (after properly ejecting it) the camera would not start again. Off with the battery, etc, etc, etc.Reading the GoPro support page, it said it needed a firmware update to '70' to resolve a problem the camera has when fitted with a video BacPac.In order to do update the firmware, I had to install the free GoPro Cineform Studio software. This software is supposed to detect if the camera needs firmware updating and automatically update it.One problem: the software refused to run. Kept getting 'GoProImport has stopped working, Windows is searching for a solution' (or some such) and the software simply never opened. So I couldn't update the firmware until THAT problem was solved. After registering on the GoProUser forum the next day, someone there suggested running under Administrator (I'm running Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit on a capable Core i7 machine.) I was running as a User. I switched to Administrator mode and, sure enough, the software ran. Yea! Thank goodness for small victories.Now it was a matter of getting the camera to turn on so the software could see it. Out with the battery, wait, wait, reload battery, try rebooting the cam, out with the battery. This goes on for hours. Finally, the camera starts for no particular reason and I plug in the USB. Amazingly, it mounts to the desktop normally. I fire up the CineForm software per the detailed firmware update instructions.However, after all this, there is no indication the HERO2 needs a firmware update. Apparently it already has the latest firmware.  That's bad news. There's now nothing I can do to 'fix' the camera, and it still won't start.So now I consider the Hero2 camera EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE compared to my original Hero 1, which never failed me. (Come to think of it, though, I did have to send it back for a problem when its BacPac failed to work. But the camera always worked.)This Hero2 may start, it may not, whether fitted with a BacPac or not.As I sit here writing this, the one-month old Hero2 will not start. Totally bricked. If you are planning on doing something important with it, TEST TEST TEST. You better make darned sure your camera works. Mine surely does not.Under the best of conditions, I get to pay for UPS to take it back to GoPro for them to fix it.I have a service request in to GoPro but have not heard back yet.""

"20120516","2.0","Fun Camera but....","The GoPro2 camera is a fun camera but the battery life is too short for me.The GoPro2 only takes good colorful photos (and videos) with ample light.Otherwise the color seems a bit washed out.I think for not too extreme conditions, you'll get better photos and videos from the big name manufacturers 'outdoor' or 'rugged' point and shoot cameras like the Nikon COOLPIX AW100, Canon PowerShot D20, Fuji XP170, Panasonic LUMIX DMC-TS4.All of the cameras I mentioned have a large rear LCD viewing screen which is optional on the GoPro2.Some of the cameras I mention have a 'backlit CMOS imager chip' great for dim light situations. Not GoPro.Some of the cameras I mentioned have built in GPS.All of the cameras I mentioned have more features/scenes/styles than the GoPro2.Some of the cameras I mentioned even have built in WiFi which is optional (and not available yet) for the GoPro2.Some of the cameras I mentioned have some kind of image stabilization. I'm not sure of the GoPro2.Some of the cameras I mentioned cost less and gets you more standard features than the GoPro2.All of the cameras I mentioned are LARGER than the GoPro2. The GoPro2 is great on the size.All the cameras I mentioned have a built in flash, The GoPro2 doesn't.All of the cameras I mentioned have a better built in microphone than the GP2, but the DO NOT have a mic jack like the GP2.All of the cameras I mentioned have a better/friendlier User Interface vs. GP2 is more cryptic (because of their size).All of the cameras I mentioned are water, dust, temperature, shock resistant +/- when compared to the GoPro2 but.......They are all 'resistant' buy their own nature 'naked' self (water proof case not required like the GoPro2).All the cameras I mentioned have 'some' zoom capability unlike GoPro2's fixed (limited angle) lens.All in all, I think the GoPro2 has its place and use. Its proven. But I cannot reproduce the amazing shots like the commercials I've seen of it, and that is what I base a cameras worthiness on. I'm sorry, but the GP2 is just to hard to achieve great colorful shots when compaired to traditional 'point and shoot' cameras.Granted the GP2 is supposed to be super rugged and small, but the point and shoot camera offer 'rugged' models too.So all I'm saying is base your decision on your use, values, needs and bang for the buck.Everybody has their own needs, standards and 'cool factor'.

"20120505","3.0","Pros and Cons","I gave the GoPro Hero2 only 3 stars due to some issues that potential buyers should be aware of.

In fact GoPro sent me these e-mail messages in regards to microphones:'Most of the time if a microphone has the ability to draw internal power from the camera, it will try to do so and stop drawing power from the battery.  The problem with this is the camera itself has about around a 2 volt supply coming from the external microphone input.  This is enough to power smaller microphones such as the mono lavalier mics, however it usually will not be enough to power a mic that also has a battery option....' 'The (GoPro) Media Team hasn't chosen any favorites yet, but they've been using the following two (expensive) lavalier mic's with decent results: Sennheiser MKE 400 and Compact Video Camera Shotgun Microphone  ($199.95) and EMW Omnidirectional Lavalier Microphone  ($159.95)....' POSTER'S NOTE: I read on-line that the RDE VideoMic and VideoMic Pro work on the Hero2 too.Not all FOV settings available for Hero2 and Firmware update protocol requires an additional program download to your computer (GoPro Cineform Studio software). Besides 2x sharper lens feature, additional photo Modes, you will only get additional FOV video settings for 1080p even though GoPro.com specs shows additional settings for 720p. GoPro told me that the 720p POV settings are for the Hero 3D only, but later firmware updates will include the 720p POV's for Hero2 in the future. After installing the GoPro Cineform Studio software, the firmware update didn't work (it didn't indicate one was needed for my new Hero2). GoPro told me to re-install Cineform Studio and try again. I found a work-around searching the net which bypassed the program install.I really like the Hero2 but I wish GoPro would have made it known about the issue with microphones and had tested various mics so that a customer would know which ones the Hero2 supports.  And I think GoPro should have let customers know that firmware version 70 does not give the Hero2 all that they show on their specifications.""

I plug it in thinking, 'Maybe the battery is dead even though the manual says it's ok to turn right on.'  I let it charge up all the way and the same issue happens.  It just won't turn on or function.  I then call gopro.  Their number isn't on their website under support.  It is on the 'products' page to entice you to order from them.

"20120427","5.0","Big Tech In A Tiny Package","I had to return my first Gopro that I ordered; unfortunately it had a defective lcd, but Amazon shipped out a new one before they even got the first one back.  I didn't know they did that!  I had a new one in my hands in like two days.I haven't yet figured out how to mount mine to my Harley without the vibration making the video almost unwatchable.  This isn't an issue isolated to me; it's a Harley thing.  Harleys vibrate and the Gopro doesn't have any kind of image stabilization - plus I think that the image being such high resolution might make it even more noticeable.  I'll just have to figure it out.  I've seen a few really, really good videos from Gopros on Harleys.I ordered a skeleton case for mine too so that I can plug it in with the mini usb that I usually use for my GPS on my scooter.  You might consider that when purchasing.  The plug is covered otherwise with the stock case presumably for keeping water and elements out.It's a lot smaller than I thought from just seeing the ads and the few I've seen in person. It packs a lot of tech in that tiny package.  The images are pretty spectacular.  This isn't your Iphone's video.  I haven't honestly used it yet to do anything more than shoot video on my bike - which as I mentioned isn't turning out all that hot so far, but generally speaking it outshines my previous setup with my Mini DV camcorder on my bike by a wide margin to say the least and I don't feel like I'm destroying my $500 Mini DV camcorder in the process.  This is what this thing is made for and it does it very well.  If I can just figure out the mounting situation to reduce the vibration - I anticipate some spectacular riding video from my future trips.I heard after my purchase that they announced a firmware upgrade this summer that will boost the bitrate options to 35mbps and give it 24p capability - FOR FREE! So that it can be integrated into timelines with other cameras easier for multicamera projects.  The images that I've seen as demonstrations of the higher bitrate look pretty fantastic!  That's higher than my much more expensive Canon HF S20's 24mbps.""

"20120314","1.0","overpriced for quality","While I know that I have seen what looks like this unit being used in several of the reality shows I watch-dirty jobs, swamp people etc., I was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of the product for the price.  You can get a fully functioning video camcorder with the ability to grab shots for about the same price and it comes with a LCD to show what you're shooting, and buy a seperate generic house for it.The unit come as stated without the LCD capability, you have to select the shooting type via the monochrome low-res pixel display on front.  There is no standard mounting hole for mounting unit on a tripod or conventional made stuff in the industry.I got the Motorsport vesion with the suction cup.  All interlinked arms of unit, including the one that hold housing w/camera in the box was cracked at the point where the metal nut meets the plastic arm piece, in all 5 were cracked with only the suction cup piece not cracked, it's made of a different type of plastic.I contacted the manufacturer via their web site and they promised a 24hr response time, to this date I have received no response.As far as picture quality, it is pretty good, extremely wide angle and the video quality is good.The unit, for something that is made to be used for extreme sports, is made of plastic.  When I contacted company via the web they wanted the seiral number off unit, to do this I had to remove back cover, which is poorly made with just little tabs to hold it in places.  Upon removing the cover the battery was hard to remove and I was scared of damaging housing in trying to remove it with small flathead screwdriver, not good if you have to swap battery in the field.  Upon removing the battery the serial # was a sticker placed on the unit, and this area of the unit seemed wavy, not the sticker but the plastic housing.I know the unit is made for fun and is suppose to be smallest video recorder in world, but I purchased a camera for about the same money, granted no rough and weather proof outside housing, but unit had LCD display, view finder, face recongnition, builtin Flash, standard mounting 1/4' hole and had a titanium housing.I returned the unit because I figured if the mounting arms are that easy to brake, I don't think I would trust it to stay mounted while I use it for skiing, diving or other rough activities.Nice idea, poor follow thru.""

Google &lt;go pro knocked off> and you can see others with similar experiences, even on dry land.I called just to report the problem, and got nothing but attitude. The GP guy I talked to first tried to say the adhesive was not the problem, because it is 'industrial strength', then went on to say that alternatives such as the vented strap mount are just as failure prone if the camera takes any kind of hit. As I say, I don't think the camera got hit, jut the helmet it was mounted on. He recommended I buy the 'floaty back', since mount failures are a given. He apparently has not spent a lot of time in Class 4 rapids, because the odds of retrieving a small item in heavy whitewater are not good. The camera case needs to have a tethering loop built in, so if the mount fails, the camera won't get away, but the tech guy just did not want to hear it.I loved the movies it took, but as a practical matter, it's an expensive risk to run at least if you are in moving water.""

"20120215","5.0","Best Christmas gift","I received the Go Pro Hero camera for a Christmas present from my grandchildren Jake & Jess. I also have a Canon miniDV camera that I have used for many years, taking video of everything from an aerobatic bi-plane ride to biking along the Colorado River. Holding the camera steady while in motion and correct framing is always a challenge. On a recent cruise to Hawaii I used my Go Pro Hero for the first time. For some video I actually used both cameras at the same time so I could compare both. I must have looked silly walking around 10,000 ft. Haleakala Crater filming the sunrise with cameras in both hands. Did I forget to mention there was a steady 40 mph wind and very cold?I used the LCD BacPac for starters, but once you have the correct setting for video, there is no need for the LCD screen unless you want to frame a particular image. I would recommend using the LCD screen for photos.Shake and bounce was much less noticable with the Go Pro, eventhough I was holding it in my hands. Next time I will try some of the different mounts (helmet, head and chest straps) and keep my hands free. It's also safer that way!The Go Pro took better video in lower light situations like walking through shadows or the darker side of craters.Wind noise always a problem with video was about the same as the Canon miniDV, but according to the instruction book the waterproof housing should help with wind noise. I haven't used it in the water yet.Likes: Small and easy to use, just set and forget. Excellent video quality. I found a fully charged battery lasted well over 1 hour non-stop record or playback. I haven't had the camera long enough to test the limits yet. Using small SD cards are much easier than carrying miniDV tapes. Cost is comparable to my miniDV camera.Dislikes: very few, but there is no zoom feature and burning a video to a DVD presents one minor problem, if you record, stop, record, and stop your play back will be in sections and not continuous, so be prepared to get plenty of use with your pause/record buttons on a DVD recorder. The Go Pro is designed and best used to take video for longer stretches of time.I love the Go Pro Hero and look forward to using it more and more, like on my motorcycle, kayaking and snorkeling. I would deffinately recommend the Go Pro for all your action sports and activities.""
"20120214","4.0","Digging it so far","I recently purchased the Motorsports version directly from GoPro. This gadget (and the free Cineform editing software from GoPro's website) has a bit of a learning curve, but if you are reasonably tech-savvy you will figure it out quickly enough.The first time I used the camera, I used the handlebar/seatpost accessory to mount it on a saddlebag guard rail on my motorcycle. Although I achieved a tight mount, the inner radius of the clamp did not exactly match the outer circumference of the bar... The result was excessive vibration and unusable video. On my second attempt I mounted the camera directly on the handlebars. Correct fit, better video quality, but still a little shaky. Harley Davidson bikes just have a fair amount of vibration- it's the nature of the beast.Then I tried the suction cup mount and stuck the thing on my gas tank right behind the gas cap. SUCCESS. The rubber part of the suction cup acts as a vibration damper, and I got the video quality I was hoping for. The suction cup held fast at 70mph, and when I removed it from the bike, it left no mark on the tank's paint finish.I also purchased the LCD Backpack accessory, which gives the camera a live view/playback capability. I feel this is must-have accessory. Maybe future generations of the camera will have this built in.Transferring files from the camera to the computer is easy- connect the camera to your computer with the included USB cable, and your computer sees the camera as an extra storage drive. Then just copy the video or photo files to your computer's hard drive. Even faster transfer is achieved if you have a laptop with a built-in card reader slot.I have not used the time lapse photography mode yet, so I can't report on that.All in all, I am very happy with the results I've achieved so far. 4 out of 5 stars, only because I haven't explored all the camera's capabilities yes.4/6/12 update; I'm thrilled with the results I'm getting with the HERO2. The suction cup mount is awesome- last week I mounted the cup on the SIDE of my H-D motorcycle's fuel tank and the thing held fast at 75mph. GoPro says it will hold fast at 150mph.Some users are poo-pooing the free Cineform software available at GoPro's website. I think their problem is, they are trying to work outside of Cineform's designed workflow by taking the not ready for use .avi files and trying to edit them. Cineform provides for editing of the .avi and then EXPORTS to your harddrive as MP4.I then take those MP4s into Windows Movie Maker and do whatever I want with them- clip, add music, wipes, captions, the whole 9 yards.I like the HERO2 so much I'm thinking of getting a second one so I can get alternate views without having to pull over and reposition the camera.""
"20120214","5.0","Highest Quality/Most Versatile Camera on the Market!","I will try to keep excessive blabbing and biased perspective out of this review, but I have to say just once that this camera is incredible!Size: Suprisingly small, the pictures make it look deceptively larger than it is. THis is a +, as you can easily carry it in a coat pocket or bag or whatever, even in its case.Weight: Extremely lightweight. I was worried about the suction cups on the motorsports package not being able to support a camera, however, once attached, I could not pry the mount or camera off of my car.Quality: In its highest settings, the quality is excellent. IF YOU PLAN ON SHOOTING ANY HIGH QUALITY VIDEO OR PHOTOS YOU NEED A CLASS 10 MEMORY CARD. I would also recommend getting a 16GB card at the smallest. Memory will go quicker than you expect, remember, its just a memory card. So if shooting things like time lapse, I recommend kicking the quality down a notch to save space. Time lapse photography was excellent. Timed photos the same. This is definately more of a video camera than a photography camera, as there is no view finder or lcd screen (in its basic form) to get a field of view. *MY ONLY COMPLAINT: This camera does not do so well in low light conditions, or in sudden drastic changes of light intensity*Durability: Lets just say the camera can stand anything short of falls off of buildings onto sidewalks. So unless you plan on BASE jumping without a parachute, you're good.Accessories: The options are near limitless. But dont be afraid to buy other than GoPro attachments. I have a number of third party accessories, and all so far have been on par with the GoPro quality, and are an exact fit.""
"20120211","4.0","Initial impressions","Just received this yesterday and haven't taken it out on the bike yet but from some of my experiments this is what I've foundShort version:I like it, it definitely works and with the exception of performing firmware upgrades on the camera and time lapse images, the abysmal Cineform software can be avoided simply by importing the .mp4 files into another video converter/editing package.Long version:Hardware is nice. Very good build quality.Video quality is very good. There's a bit more fisheye to it than I expected. Tweaking from the menus reduces it but it's still  more than I see in the sample videos online so I must have some tweaking to do yet.LCD display is very tiny. If you're past the half century mark as I am, you're going to have a hard time selecting modes and configuring it. I got the LCD backpac with it and that makes it much easier to see the icons, though you're still navigating through unfamiliar and low resolution icons using a two button interface.I really like the hardware quality, and based on the videos from users I've seen, it's got the image quality I want. It's small, it's light and it works.The cons:I always download the manuals for products before I buy them, just to see if there are any show-stoppers. One of the things I liked about the Hero2 is the manual says that you can use it while it's plugged into the USB port. Unfortunately they forgot the asterisk after that feature. What should be there is '* as long as the camera is running at the time you plug it in to the USB port'. As far as I can tell you can't turn it on and use it after it has been plugged in to the USB. You must be taking video at the time you plug it in and if you stop recording after you've plugged it in then it switches back to USB mode (i.e. charging only, no video) There may be some magic in the manual that I haven't found yet so far that's the way it is. The only thing it's useful for (and I can see it being a critical feature) is if you are in the middle of taking video of something important and the battery gets low you can plug in the USB cable and keep on going.GoPro Cineform software. Bleah. Really really bleah. It's got an unintuitive user interface and in ~30 minutes of use I've had it crash with assertion failures 4 times and discovered several significant bugs, one that can potentially result in lost data. The potential data loss one involves changing the file format when converting video. I used Cineform to convert one of the .mp4 videos to an .avi. It created the .avi file in the output directory as expected. When that file turned out to be unplayable by VLC media player, I changed my settings to export as .mov and ran the conversion again. Two things happened: it ignored my settings and saved the video to the default video directory, not to the one in my settings, and when it finished I found that it had written the video to the same file name it used before - in other words it saved an .mov file with a .avi extension on it.Codec issues: While the .mp4 files it saves on the SD card seem to play fine with everything I've tried, VLC can't play back the converted videos Cineform produces. When I try to play back the .avi file using VLC I get an error: 'No suitable decoder module: VLC does not support the audio or video format 'CFHD'. Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this.' Playback on Windows Media Player is fine.Time lapse mode: I (stupidly) assumed that it would record to a video format since that would use very little space. It doesn't, it records each frame to a separate .jpg file. This is the only video related feature I've found that seems to require you to use Cineform. Cineform present the sequence of .jpg files as one video clip. Anything else (like Picasa or Windows Explorer) just gives you a looong list of numbered .jpg files. The other annoyance is that individual .jpgs use a lot of storage if you're doing time lapse at high resolution. Using a 2 second time interval between frames it filled a 32GB SD card in less than 15 minutes using 11 megapixel images.The major annoyance:They have no official support forums. You want to learn tricks, techniques and workarounds for the plentiful bugs in Cineform? Have fun with google because GoPro doesn't maintain any sort of forum (or if they do, I haven't found it yet) I'm guessing that's due in part to the fact that people would spend a lot of time flaming on Cineform.The minor annoyances:Over-packaging taken to extremes, put on steroids, gone feral. I mean really excessive/irresponsible waste of natural resources. Gigantic clear plastic display case taped to even bigger cardboard box, and a big square of hard plastic with a mounting shoe glued to the top of the box. Then they add nice little touches like providing printed copies of the manuals - tiny little copies the size of the camera that are in fonts too small for anyone over 30 to read. To put the icing on the cake they print the LCD backpac manual in an inverse color scheme - black background (thanks for that waste of ink) with white letters that causes what would be a minimally usable manual to be completely unusable.You'll find unreadable manuals in the boxes but you won't find a CD with the software or manuals on it - you have to go to the website to download those. You also won't find a quick-start page/card/sheet in there. First thing you read when you open the manual is how to insert a battery - it doesn't start with 'here's how the latch to release the camera from the case works so you can install a battery.' You have to skip way down in the manual to see how to do that. It really seems like they should have either gone one way or the other - either include readable printed manuals or else require everything be downloaded from their site and just put a quick start guide in the box. As it is it's the worst of both worlds - I couldn't read what they gave me and it didn't save me from having to go to their website to download stuff either.Things they missed:It has a USB interface. Why do they (and other small device manufacturers) not provide an easy to use PC based interface to configure the device?Why oh why oh why do I have to do the 800 button presses just to set the time and date? Again, it's got a USB cable on it. My 10 year old Canon digital camera has the ability to set the camera's time and date from the PC clock. How hard can it be?If it had some sort of simple programming API - say REST or SOAP based, the open source crowd would sell more cameras for them than they could produce. They should scrap the Cineform effort and focus on making the camera features available via an API.Now get off my lawn! D**n kids!=== Update 2012-04-18 ===Well, managed to record a head-on collision with another dirt bike. Search for 'speed + target fixation' on youtube. The video quality is fantastic (and so is the ability of my fat ol' bod to roll down a hillside) I took that one using the chest mount - which as far as I can tell is the best way to take video from an upright-style motorcycle. Obviously it wouldn't work on a sport bike and given how fat and wide cruisers tend to be I'd guess it wouldn't work that well on one of those (though I have far too much self respect to actually ride a cruiser so YMMV :p)I'm currently running battery benchmarks on it in preparation for a long ride in June.One problem I have is that it takes longer for the batteries to charge than it does to discharge. That means I've got to come up with a better solution because the very last thing I want to be doing on a 3,000 mile motorcycle ride is to set an alarm at night so I can get up every 4 hours and swap batteries on the charger :\ I've had this problem with every helmet camera I own.What I've found so far:I'm recording at 960 pixels 30 fps so that the 32GB SDHC cards don't fill up before the battery dies.Using either a GoPro or Wasabi (aftermarket) battery and turning the LCD backpac off I get between 1:50 and 2:15 recording time regardless of resolution, size, or brand of SD card used.Using an internal battery plus an external 3400mAh battery pack and leaving the LCD backpac turned on (which eats a lot of power) I got 3:15 of recording. There was only a small amount of motion in it (just pointed it out my office window at the pasture out back) and it's just a tad over 19GB.The external battery pack looks like a potential solution - but I'd have to put a hole in the waterproof case if I wanted to simply plug it into the camera USB port as an auxiliary battery :\I believe I'll end up buying a couple of the higher capacity battery packs (they make them up to 10,000mAh) and use those to recharge the GoPro batteries while I'm riding. Then at night I'll recharge the big batteries from the USB ports on my laptop and a small 110V wall-wart USB power supply.Update 2012/05/06: I purchased one of the Anker 8400mAh batteries ([...]) and tried it out last night. I set resolution down to WVGA 60fps and I left the LCD backpac turned on (which eats a *lot* of power) and I got just over 8 hours of recording time. It was only 2GB shy of filling up a 32GB SD card. Unless you're using it as a regular hand-held video camera the LCD backpac would normally be turned off. I believe I'll get 10 to 12 hours of recording time with it off which is sufficient for a full day of riding for me.The biggest thing I don't like about the external battery solution is those external batteries have a very limited lifetime - typically around 100 charge/discharge cycles. Then it's a throwaway/recycle Pretty wasteful but I don't know of a better solution.I really hate having to fumble around with SD cards and batteries when I'm on a long ride. The GoPro in particular is a pain, mostly because it's very difficult to remove the battery from the camera, especially with tired/slightly numb fingers.Overall it's the best helmet camera I've used so far. Yeah it's a bit fumbly fiddly to make it go but unlike all the other cameras I've used, this one really delivers on the video quality. It has now survived one motorcycle wreck and at least half a dozen tumbles to the floor, twice on concrete, twice on wood - and it keeps on ticking.""
"20120210","5.0","I love it","It is very rugged compact and versatile.I use it manly for sports action on 720 and 60fps it looks awesomelow light is not as great but that's OK.""
"20120210","5.0","great camera","the go pro is a great hd mini camera. it is very impressive you can film in hd with such a small device. the only problem I had is that a part of a tripod broke but I guess it must have been missuse.also the seller was perfect, i received it on time and in perfect conditions, this is remarkable since it travelled all the way to argentina.""
"20120209","1.0","Pain In the A$$","After using for a while doing all sorts of stuff, my heartfelt opinion is that it's a pain to use.Charging- When damage is most likely to occur due to the fact that any protective shell is going to have to come off and with the crappy battery life, this will be often.The LCD attachment- Renders the head strap useless because the back of the unit becomes deeper which prvents the camera from tilting flush with the mount.  STUPID STUPID STUPID.  Maybe they sell some sort of extention for this overlooked problem, i don't know.Forget about sound...  Your faced with a choice, sound or full elemental protection.Goofy looking.Indoor quality terrible. And yes, bro, i do realize this is geared towards outdoor activities.  But seriously?Only good thing was the field of view- but not worth all the other problems.I Returned the camera.""
"20120208","1.0","Terrible Underwater Video and Service","I got this camera for Christmas, and wasn't able to get out and water test it until after the 30 day return period (big mistake).  Despite being advertised as a waterproof video camera, the GoPro takes TERRIBLE underwater video.  The lense does not compensate for the water distortion, and everything is very blurry.  I called GoPro and they were very rude.  They said I should have read the 'fine print' in their FAQ section before buying the camera, since it 'clearly' says there the video is blurry.  I later found out that GoPro was fixing the problem, and developing a new housing with a designated flat lense for underwater use.  I asked them if they would ship it to me when it became availible to make this right.  Again, they were rude and told me to pound sand.Don't believe the hype on this camera.  You are much better off getting a normal, cheap point and shoot that does video and just buy a underwater housing for it.  At least then you can see what you are doing through the LCD back, which you can't do with the GoPro.  DON'T BUY IT.""
"20120207","5.0","Amazing little camera . . .","I've had my eye on one of these little cameras for a while and I finally treated myself to one. I primarily wanted one for time lapse photography and this camera does not disappoint. I did experience reliability problems with the original software. After frustrations such as time lapse mode not working more than once per charge and the battery draining even when the camera is off, I checked to see if there was a firmware update. There was and since installing it, the camera has worked very, very well. I am still playing around with the settings but overall I am very happy.I am not as happy with the suction mount. It really needs a swivel. GoPro should also include a few extra screws; especially the longer ones.""
