Peak PKC0RB Wireless Back-Up Camera System with 3.5-Inch LCD Color Monitor
The Peak Wireless 3.5-Inch Back-Up Camera System lets you actually see what is behind you--even if it is in the blind spot below your back window. Now you can know for sure if there's a car, bike, or child behind your vehicle before backing up. This easy-to-install system includes a color camera unit that attaches to the back of your license plate. This camera comes equipped with a 2.4 GHz wireless transmitter that sends video to the 3.5-inch color LCD monitor that mounts on your dashboard. The system offers a wide 110-degree field of view, and the camera is weatherproofed for a long life.  It's perfect for cars, trucks, SUVs, RVs, and trailers.
