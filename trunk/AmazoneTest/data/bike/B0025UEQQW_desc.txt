GoPro Chest Mount Harness for HERO Cameras
Chest Harness for your quick-release HERO camera. Makes it easy to capture immersive video and photo footage from, well your chest. Perfect for skiing, mountain biking, motocross, paddle sports, or any activity where you want to get a "lower than the helmet" view of the action. See more of your arms, knees poles, and skis while skiing or your arms and handlebars while biking or riding your motorcycle. Recommended as a more immersive way to film than on the helmet.
