Panasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom (Black)
The 12.1-megapixel DMC-FZ150K continues a long line of great hybrid digital cameras from Panasonic by giving you more options not only in how you take pictures, but including the ability for full HD 1920x1080 60p AVCHD movie recording. The camera's 24x Leica DC Vario- Elmarit lens system featuring two aspherical lenses, three aspherical surfaces, three ED elements, and one Nano Surface Coated Lens gives you more options for framing both your photos and movies, and the intelligent auto shooting mode allows you to take great worry free photos and movies. A new High Sensitivity MOS imaging chip, hybrid digital camera technology, and an improved processing engine make sure that you're able to capture photos and movies in the moment by reducing shutter lag and increasing burst shooting potential. Add in a bevy of scene options, movie color modes, and an anti-glare treated 3.0" LCD view screen and you've got one incredible package in digital camera form! And it shoots 3D still images that can be viewed on your 3D compatible TV!
