"20120611","4.0","Great all round camera","This is an absolutely brilliant camera. I have been using the Nikon d3000 and bought this for a company I worked with in Vietnam. Practically some of the issues I have found with my d3000 include a slow internal computer (so images take a while to process enough to be able to review them on the screen), slow autofocus and limited ISO range. All of these are far better in the d5100.You should be aware of a few things. 1.) When in video mode the aperture settings will say that they are changing but in actuality the aperture will stay the same. You need to go out of live view, change the aperture and then go back into live view. Once live view is on aperture does not change. 2.) Don't shoot with live view, bro. It is far slower than shooting through the viewfinder, the exposure that is shown on the screen isn't always accurate and when you hit the shutter it takes about a second before the camera will capture your image. Live view shouldn't sell this camera for you. 3.) Finally, the area around the memory card slot gets really overheated when you are shooting video for a long period of time. I haven't had any issues yet but I am worried about what that is doing to the camera and the card.I love this thing, and if I had the money I would buy myself one personally. Having said that, if I had the money I would buy a D4. I will recommend that if you are looking at buying this as your first dlsr camera and you have limited funds to buy a lower quality body and get extra lenses. I woud rather have my d3000 with my 50mm f/1.4 than this d5100 with only the stock lens.""
"20120609","4.0","No Case?",".  Everyone here knows far more about cameras than I do so this is not about the technical aspects.  I am just expressing surprise about the lack of a case for a six hundred plus dollar camera.  I just bought a  seventy-five dollar Nikon binoculars and it had a case.  Seems odd , but maybe that is the practice.  Anyway, you might as well add a case and a spare battery to your Amazon order..""
"20120608","5.0","Great starter DSLR camera from point and shot....","I've had this camera for almost a year. No problems what so ever. The picture quality is great however there is a bit of a learning curve at the beginning. I purchased the Nikon D5100 because it takes HD video at 1080i. I will say this the video does come out a bit choppy from time to time. Another reason for this purchase was to take quality pictures of my baby girl who is almost 1 year old. If you are looking for a solid camera that is not to expensive buy with confidence. One thing to point out I only purchased the body not the lens that came with it. Currently I have a Nikkor AF-S 50mm 1:1.4G mm for portraits which takes awesome pictures and a Nikkor AF-S 18-200mm 1:3.5-5.6G II ED telephoto lens which I use 80% of the time plus the SB700 flash. Trust me the flash makes a huge difference.""

We've played with the HDR functionality, and taken a few videos.There is nothing bad that I can yet say about this camera. After loads of online research and a few in-store visits to retailers, we knew this was the ideal camera for the price.The photos to my eye are phenomenal, and for our purpose this is all that we could have asked for.The learning curve is whatever you make it with this camera.

"20120605","5.0","my experience w/ the D5100 and Sigma 18-250 lens.","I've been shooting with my D80 for the last 4 years now and have been very happy with it, but was bothered by the high ISO quality and the lack of video.  Read a lot of the reviews on Amazon and agree w/ most of them.  Just wanted to toss out my experience with my Sigma 18-250 HSM lens that I paired up with this camera, since there doesn't seem to be any of those experiences on the internet right now.  Overall, I think that the lens combination really seems to be working well.  The lens of big and heavy, disproportionally more than the camera which is lighter than the D80 that I had.  I am purchasing the battery grip to give it a little more balance, just like I did with my D80.  Shooting-wise, it does great.  Love the clean pics up to ISO 3200, unheard of on my D80.  Using the Liveview is a little but more annoying.  It seems to struggle to autofocus when the lens is zoomed out.  I read that it needs a fast aperture to be able to do live view, and the Sigma for all of its benefits is really slow.  So, consider that if you're planning doing a lot of liveview, which I don't.  Love the articulating screen.  Don't really miss the second screen on the top of the camera.  It's not too annoying to just hit the 'info' button if I want to know more data.  Also, the live view was really helpful for using a manual focus f/1.4 85 mm lens that I had.  I couldn't focus on anything accurately enough through the viewfinder.Anyways, just wanted to toss my data out there.  Love this camera.""

I have treated this camera with kidd gloves, and was standing still taking a number of photos when it just started taking black photos. But I have now read other reviews with this same unrelability problem, that the camera just starts taking black photos. Very disappointed to find that this is not a rare occurrence, but has happened to others.

"20111221","4.0","Excellent SLR with a couple minor quibbles","I've been using this camera as a replacement for my D70s and couldn't be happier. The image quality is superb, the camera is lighter (yet doesn't feel cheap) than my D70s, and is very easy to use.My only quibbles are:-The area autofocus likes to grab the least interesting thing in the picture and use that as its focus point. Is that a dead tree 75 feet away? Perfect! Some random dude in a crowd behind your family? Excellent! You can change this in most modes, but in auto the setting doesn't seem persistent? It's a function I need to play with more, but once you're aware of the camera's habit, it's easy to correct for.-Image stabilization in video mode. How did they justify cheaping out and not including this feature? The video quality is great, but lack of stabilization really hurts. Also, you tend to cover the microphone with your camera strap if you're not careful, adding some noise. Use a tripod, brace yourself, do something, otherwise you'll shoot some really shaky video.-Buy a screen protector. I scratched mine within a week of having the camera. It would have been nice if the screen was recessed slightly to add a touch of protection, but that certainly would have cost it size.""
"20111215","4.0","best image quality available, quirky controls","If your number one priority is image quality, especially in low-light situations, and your budget is at $800 or lower, get this camera.  It has the same Sony sensor found in the Nikon D7000, and I suspect it's similar to the highly regarded ones in the Sony Alpha 580 and Nex 5N.  As the reviewers at dpreview.com stated: 'At low ISO settings, the D5100 is on a par with the best of the competition, but at the higher ISO settings, it produces some of the best image quality that we've ever seen from an APS-C camera.' Tests from DXOMark and reviews from several other sites confirm this assessment.I had a Canon t2i for about a week, but returned it in favor of this camera, and I'm very pleased with that decision.  That's not to say that the Canon t2i and t3i (which share the same sensor and have very similar image output) are necessarily sub par.  In many respects, they are superior, but it depends on what's most important to you and what you plan on doing with the camera.Here's a comparison between the D5100 and t2i/t3i, cameras that are competing for the same customers.D5100 ADVANTAGES- IMAGE QUALITY, especially at higher ISO's.  The camera has a larger sensor than the t3i and fewer pixels per square centimeter.  And when it has noise, it's more of the grainy type (which I prefer) than the blotchy, JPG artifact kind (which is what I got from the t2i).  Being able to use photos taken at 3200 and even 6400 ISO means faster shutter speeds at lower lights, which is essential for someone like me who has kids and wants to be able to take photos indoors without using the flash.  As I mentioned above, the D5100 likely has the best sensor of any APS-C camera currently available.- NICER KIT LENS.  The picture quality isn't necessarily better (although the t3i's larger sensor will show more of the imperfections of a lower quality lens than the D5100's and the kit lens is definitely a low quality lens compared to the other offerings in either the Canon or Nikon line), but the build at least feels better.  The movement on the zoom and focus rings were much less smooth on the t2i, especially when going from 24 to 18mm.  This might not matter for functionality and durability, but it bothered me quite a bit, and that matters since I'm not planning on getting a nicer kit lens for quite some time.- BETTER BUILD/FITS NICER IN HANDS.  This is very subjective, but the t2i's body felt cheap in my hands and was harder to hold. The t3i's body has been altered just a bit to improve the ease of holding it, but the plastic is the same as the t2i.  In addition, the spot on my t2i where you're supposed to put your right thumb would give a bit when I pressed on it and make a small sound.  I've read accounts of the t2i surviving drops and other mishaps that would have killed off lesser cameras.  I also like the feel of the rubber on the Nikon better.  Now, maybe how the plastic feels and whether it gives in a spot or two don't really matter as far as durability is concerned, but if you're using the camera regularly, you want to like how it feels in your hands.  I should add that many reviewers prefer the feel of the Canon over the Nikon, so on this point, you'll just have to try the cameras out yourself.- SHUTTER DURABILITY.  The D5100's shutter is tested at 100,000 cycles.  That doesn't mean that every D5100 will last that long, but at least they provide evidence that it should.  Canon doesn't do the same test (or at least post the results) for the t3i.  They claim it's because it's not a guarantee of shutter durability, but I've found websites that allow users to enter in when their shutter stops working or if it's continuing to work, and Nikons were usually superior than Canons on these tests, especially among the lower end models.- CUSTOMIZATION/POST-EDITING.  I feel like I was able to customize many more of the settings in the D5100 than the t2i, especially settings that affected how the camera processed the JPEGs (such as the color, sharpness, contrast, etc. of the image).  There are also a lot of options for editing photos in the camera after taking them, such as correcting for chromatic aberration and barrel distortion.  If you mostly use shareware photography software (like Picasa and Gimp), then having these in camera editing options might be important.- LONGER BATTERY LIFE.  I didn't have both cameras long enough to really say which had better batter life, but on paper, the D5100's battery is supposed to last 50% longer.CANON T2i/3i ADVANTAGES- FASTER AUTO FOCUS.  The auto focus was slighter faster in the t2i, especially in low light conditions.  I find that the D5100 has to have one of it's auto focus points on some sort of contrasting spot in low light conditions.  The D5100 does have an AF lamp, but it's so bright that it's not reasonable to use in settings with human subjects in the photo.- QUICK ACCESS TO SETTINGS.  Although the D5100 is very customizable, it can take several clicks to change the most basic settings, such as ISO, WB, etc.  How I wish they would use Canon's basic menu for quick access to camera settings.  It was a joy to change settings on the Canon. Not so much with the Nikon.  If you set your camera to auto-ISO (and the parameters you can set on the auto-ISO are awesome), you can't override the auto-ISO without going deep into one of the menus and turning it off.  ARGH!!!!  How frustrating!- BETTER INFO IN VIEWFINDER.  It's nearly impossible to tell what the ISO is in the D5100 looking in your optical viewfinder.  The best I can get it to do is to show me what the ISO is before I push the shutter release button half way down to auto focus.  For some reason, Nikon decided that photographers would rather know how many images can fit into the buffer (this affects how many photos you can take in a row in continuous shooting mode) than what the ISO is set at.  This is ridiculous, especially since there's plenty of room in the view finder to always show the ISO and the amount of space left in the buffer.  It didn't need to be an either/or choice.- SLIGHTLY BIGGER VIEWFINDER.  The t2i's viewfinder is slightly bigger, but it's not enough of a difference for me to really be able to tell like you can when going from the t3 (small viewfinder) to the t2i/3i or D5100.- SCREEN.  The screen on the t2i has more pixels and is slightly more sharper.  Plus, it's the same ratio as the sensor so when you review your photos, the photo fills the entire screen.  I'm not sure why other cameras don't also do this.  Also, I'm less worried about the t2i's screen getting scuffed up.  Part of his is  because I own a Canon G10, which has a similar screen as the t2i, and it hardly has any scratches (and none that affect what you see on the screen) even though I never used a cover on it.- VIDEO CONTROLS.  You can change the aperture while the video is recording.  The way the D5100 chooses the aperture is based on what it was set at in the last photo you took, which is odd.  Also, the D5100's microphone is too close to the lens, so in quiet videos, you hear every movement of the lens.  If video isn't that important to you, then this doesn't matter at all.- BETTER PLACEMENT OF SPIN DIAL or control wheel or whatever you call it.  If you're going to only have one spin dial, it should be by the shutter release button where you can turn it with your forefinger (as in the Canons) and not on the back for your thumb (as in the Nikons).  The reason for this is that there's much more room for buttons on the back, so with the spin dial by the shutter release button, you can hold down a bunch of different buttons on the back with your thumb while spinning the spin dial with your forefinger.  The reverse isn't true when the spin dial is on the back (there's room for only so many buttons on the top plate of the camera).  In other words, Canon has put their spin dial in the more optimal location.- The combination of quicker access to common shooting parameters, more useful info in the viewfinder, and a better placed spin dial mean that you're more easily able to change settings without ever taking your eye away from the viewfinder.  That's a very nice feature.- AUTO FOCUS MOTOR/LENS COMPATIBILITY.  Because the t2i has a built in auto focus motor, it can auto focus with lenses that don't have their own motors.  The same isn't true of the Nikon D5100.  However, many of the most common Nikon lenses have built in auto focus motors (they're the AF-S kind).  And their prices aren't that much different from those of Canon.  Another thing to consider is whether you plan on buying more lenses during the life of your camera. At most, I think I'll get one of the cheaper 50mm lenses ($200 for the AF-S one, $120 for the non-AF-S, which means manual focus on the D5100), so this didn't concern me too much.WHAT'S NOT ON THE LIST?- MEGAPIXELS.  Anything above 8 megapixels is plenty big for even 8X10 photos.  I'm not planning on doing shoots for magazine spreads, so having 16 or 18 megapixels only matters to me to the extent that it affects image quality.  If cramming more pixels means lower image quality, especially in low light situations, then I don't want those extra megapixels.- FLIP OUT SCREEN.  I almost consider this a gimmick.  I realize it's useful for video work and there's a convenience factor to it when taking photos of objects down low or from up above, but it seems like it could be more of a liability than a benefit--by having the flip out screen, you've just added an additional joint to your machine that could easily break if pressure were applied the wrong way when the screen is extended out.  On the other hand, maybe being able to store your camera with the screen facing in might protect it, but the screen is most vulnerable when you're using the camera, and usually, you'll have the screen facing out when using it.  In sum, I'd rather pay $100 less than have the screen.- LIVE VIEW.  It's a wash.  The D5100 focuses faster, but takes much longer to actually take the photo after you push the shutter release button all the way down.  The t2i, on the other hand, takes forever to focus, but it at least takes the photo more quickly once your push the button.  In some ways, that gives the t2i the advantage, but I don't care that much for Live View, except in scenarios where I want to zoom in ten times and auto focus, but in those scenarios, speed of auto focus and shutter lag don't really matter.THE TOUGH CHOICEThe harder question to answer is whether the Nikon D5100 is preferable to the Canon t2i, which one can get new for $150 to $200 less.  You might think I would say yes, but I bought the D5100 refurbished with a 1 year warranty that covers damage from normal use.  The price was reduced to the point that it was close to that of the Canon t2i, so it made sense for me to go with the D5100, especially since I give a lot of weight to image quality in low light situations, and I like how the D5100 felt in my hands.  It took weeks for me to come to a decision, and I suppose it might take just as long or longer for you.On the bright side, both cameras are capable machines and surpass the top of the line DSLR's from not too long ago.  Both are going to produce quality images.  Both are part of a system with a large range of lenses at comparable prices.  It's just a matter of taste and weighing trade-offs.  One thing I have noticed in comparing Canon and Nikon is that Canon seems to fault on the side of higher megapixels while Nikon has been more concerned with image quality.  The difference isn't much, but I do think it's a difference.Well, best of luck in your decision!OVERALL RATINGOverall, I can only give the D5100 4 stars.  I wish I could give it 5, but after using it for a few days and realizing that I had quicker access to essential parameters (like turning off auto ISO or changing the shooting mode from single to continuous) in my old point and shoot, I can't give this camera 5 stars.  I suspect Nikon did this so that the semi-pros wouldn't buy the D5100 instead of the D7000, which has the same sensor and similar functions but much better manual controls, along with a better body (weather sealing) and an auto focus motor drive in the body.  I guess I could hope and wish that Nikon would do a firmware update to correct some of these problems (at least let me turn Auto-ISO off in one or two clicks, please!), but I'll be hoping and wishing in vain.MORE REVIEWSFor other comparisons of these two cameras, check out DigitalReview.ca, SnapSport, and DXOMark""

"20111208","5.0","PLEASED WITH PURCHASE- Megazoom to DSLR","I am a former point and shoot user, who decided to upgrade to get better quality pictures. I did a few months of research, and realized that the two main contenders to suit my pocket was the Canon T3I and the Nikon D5100.T3I Vs D5100I read every article, watched every video on youtube that spoke about these two cameras and it all comes down to this: if you place your MAIN emphasis on capturing excellent stills, and you love the convenience of video but not into it seriously, then the D5100 is the camera for you. It allows you to take more useable picutes at the higher ISOs than the T3I and you get a longer battery life as well. If however, you want the brilliant pictures, and are a little more serious about videos, the manual controls offered by the T3I gives it the edge as it relates to video.D5100 PROS- Brilliant picture quality- it takes a little bit of tweaking to get it just right, but when you do, the pictures are stunning.- The build quality is good for its price range- personally, after holding both this and the T3I in my hands, i preferred the feel of the D5100 esp around the grip area.- Ease of use- as my first DSLR camera, i found it easy enough to use once you get a hang of the controls- Tilt screen- this is one of my favorite features, because it allows you to capture certain angles without having to lie flat on the ground all the time, or climb a tree- Noise profile- i found that i was able to get useable pictures at ISOs higher than 1600D5100 CONS- No built in autofocus mechanism- i found that this limited the number of lenses that could be used on the camera- No dedicated ISO button- this is such an important feature, i thought that it earned the right to have its own dedicated buttonCONCLUSIONAfter having done all the research, and deciding eventually to buy the D5100 over the T3I, i have not regretted my purchase. i think that the advantages stated above, more than compensates for the challenges faced with this camera. As the camera that has introduced me to DSLR photography, i think i am in capable hands, and have already produced pictures that people feel can easily make it to a magazine. So, as stated before, if videography is not a biggie for you, and you want to take stunning pictures, the D5100 is most definitely the camera for you.""
"20111207","4.0","Excellent camera d5100","The d5100 is an excellent entry to midlevel dslr. I've shot both the d5100 and the t3i (its competitor) and find both to be almost equal. If u are new to dsrls' u cant go wrong with either camera.The d5100 is solid but not to heavy. Controls are intuitive and somewhat easy to locate. The menu system takes about an hour to understand, but gives excellent visual cues to what mode you are switching to, and or what kind of shot you want to compose....great feature!The flip-out screen is clear and bright; it's nice for shooting video at low or high angles and self-portraits.battery life is long. The viewfinder displays all the info you need and is easy to understand.The 'effects' mode is fun to use and creates interesting pictures.The video mode is just ok. The auto focus does great if your subject stays at a constant depth/focal length. But once your subject moves closer or father away the auto focus struggles to find and refocus quickly or at all. To be fair, even the d7000 (which is rated best by numerous pundits) struggles with this as well. If you are buying the d5100 to shoot video of kids or fast moving objects, you will be disappointed.'Live view' (seeing the scene on the LCD display) makes for easy viewing and the controls to activate it are a finger swipe away. A+Picture quality is excellent. you will be amazed how clear, bright and vivid photos become.Overall the d5100 will meet all your needs (minus fast moving video shooting).  Before i bought this level of dsrl i had only taken photos with a point and shoot. I read countless reviews about dsrls and worried that i needed to find the best rated camera with the most features. But since owning the d5100 i've noticed that i mainly shoot in auto or program mode. It seems that i can compose nice pics just by letting the camera set the aperture, ISO and shutter speed.  Hopefully, as i advance my skills i will use more features?!?!?Hope this review helps.""

"20111203","2.0","I returned it. Not quite the upgrade I expected","I currently own a D5000. I have owned the previous D40x, D60 and like photography. I got the D5100 expecting a decent upgrade. Unfortunately I was kind of disappointed when comparing it with my D5000. The D5100 feels more amateur than the D5000 does. It is smaller (almost too small) and difficult to grab if you have a 18-200 as I do. In addition, the d5100 does not offer the possibility to customize the lcd display (for manual and auto modes) as the D5000 does, this bugged me because that is an easy way to notice in which mode I am shooting. Another downgrade of the D5100 is the lack of the grid in the viewfinder. The viewfinder seems oriented to those who have a point and shot and want to upgrade. It is clear that Nikon here is aiming to those who shoot using the lcd display and not to those using the viewfinder. That, for me, is a big loss compared with my D5000, I do a lot of architecture photography and the grid is very helpful; it also helps me to keep the horizon when shooting landscapes, the lake or the ocean.I returned the D5100 after comparing it hand to hand with the D5000. Not enough of an upgrade for me and not worth the expense. The D5100 is cute, small and might work well for those who want to try a dslr for the very first time. I guess I am just going to wait for the next model or save up some money to reach the D7000.""
"20111129","5.0","Can I give it 6 stars?","I am in love. This camera is an incredible DSLR for a beginner. It does everything I need it to do and it is very simple to use. I am now into photography as a hobby because I love the pictures this camera produces. The starter lens is perfect for beginners and I recommend buying a how to use this camera guide (David Busch's Nikon D5100 Guide to Digital SLR Photography) because it leaves you wanting to know more. Highly recommend this machine!""
"20111127","5.0","Perfect camera","I've used professional cameras for years, most of them Nikon. After getting tired of the dust in my Canon EOS 20D, y switched again to Nikon with this superb camera.Is quick and responsive, has a superb image quailty and a high-res screen with a high degree of customization. Be advise that I don't need all the flutes that came with the D7000.""
"20111126","5.0","Great photo quality - but you'll need to update the firmware","Out of the box, I was having a lot of problems with the camera recognizing my Sandisk Extreme Pro SD cards.  I could take three or four photos and then the camera would give me a 'No SD card inserted' message and stop working.  This happened several times and I actually started packing everything up to return it.  I'm glad that I went to Nikon's website first and found the firmware update...The update is easy to perform and completely takes care of the issue.  In the SETUP MENU of your camera, scroll all the way down to FIRMWARE VERSION.  If your camera reads 1.00 on the A and B lines, you'll want to perform the update.With the firmware issue out of the way, I am really happy with the performance of this camera.  The photo quality is nothing short of outstanding.  The D5100 performs very well in low light situations and also has a high dynamic range to handle difficult high contrast situations.Additional note:  A nice 'bonus' feature is that this camera can use old manual focus lenses - even the non-AI models.  They can only be used in Manual exposure mode.  You will have to use an external meter to calculate exposure (or use the histogram information in the photo playback to check exposure). If you don't mind using classic, old-school photography technique, lenses like the 50mm f1.4 and 55mm micro Nikkor can acquired at very low cost.  They can produce outstanding results with this camera using the 'Rangefinder' mode to help indicate when your subject is in focus.  You will need to make sure that the lens that you want will not interfere with the mirror in the camera - this caveat would mostly apply to older fish-eye and specialty lenses that were designed to use with the mirror locked-up in the older film cameras of the day.""
"20111125","4.0","Still learning","I'm still learning to use the camera mainly because When I purchased a disc to format for the camera, I could not format it with the camera. I'm trying to determine if the D5100 needs a specific disc or if there is something wrong with the camera. I used the disc from my D40 and was able to operate the camera and when I switched the new disc to my D40 it is operational. With the transferred disc the D5100 seem to work beautifully , but i'm trying to determine if there is an internal problem with the camera or just the fact that I'm not understanding something about formating the disc.""

I work in the fashion industry and I know a good image is a combination of a good camera, setting and subject. This has changed how I take pictures and I love the result. It's very easy to use. I am slowly playing now with the manual mode and I can not wait to shoot when I figure out what all the proper settings are. On auto mode, you ill still get a great result.

"20111118","5.0","Buy this Camera...","Wow got this camera 2 days ago and have been loving it every sence. This is my first DSLR so I don't know much about how to use it but it was fairly easy to take out of the box and just use the many Auto settings which turn out some beautiful pics. Can't wait to learn everything I can about this camera and having fun along the way. It got here 2 days eariler than predicted. So I must say thank you Amazon for being a great place to shop and Thank you Nikon for making a wonderful camera.Lens fever is setting in now.  :)The only thing I am not unbelievable happy about is the manual. People have recommended Nikon D5100 for dummies instead so that is next.""
"20111114","5.0","Natural progression from the world of digital megazoom","For the last year or so I have been pushing my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8 to the max. I just wasn't achieving the level of quality and professionalism I needed. I knew it was not possible as long as I skirted the world of the dSLR for fear of the price tag and all that. But when I had the chance, I took the plunge into that tantalizingly beautiful world, and I have not looked back.Except when my 18-55mm lens doesn't zoom in as close as was used to with my Lumix. ;) But the depth of field, high quality, manual options, and wonderful speed of my d5100 more than make up for that. I'll just get a bigger lens some day.Also, a note for those of you who may be doing what I did and going back and forth (x1,000,000...) between the 3100 and 5100: If you're coming from the digital point-and-shoot or megazoom world, any dSLR will be better than what you've got! The 3100 is an excellent camera, and you would probably not notice much of a difference between the two*. But if your budget can handle it, I would definitely recommend the 5100. The rotating LCD is wonderful, those extra couple of megapixels are nice, and it is fast. There are some other pluses, but I haven't fully explored them all yet.Well, I think this turned out more like a blog entry than a review, but hopefully someone out there will benefit from it. And that it will encourage the step into dSLR photography.THE END.*This wisdom was imparted to me by a very kind lady in the photography department at my local Best Buy who was not out to sell me the highest-priced camera but rather to find out what I needed and help me find it. I like to give credit where credit's due, so there you have it. ;)""
"20111113","1.0","Nikon D5100 Unreliable","I had my Nikon D5100 for three months of moderate use when it just stopped working.  The display screen went black though the physical mechanism still worked.  The photos taken are all pure black, as if the light sensor burned out but everything else worked.  I haven't dropped it or subjected it to any extreme conditions.  I was in the middle of shooting about 20 pix when it just went black.  I've sent it back to Nikon for repair.When I bought the Nikon D70, it broke down, too, after about a year of use.  Nikon repaired a defective circuit board for free, though I had to pay $35 in shipping charges.  It took about six weeks to get the camera back.I've been using Nikons for forty years.  The film Nikons were tanks, which held up well for long periods.  These two digital SLR Nikons are a different story.  They broke down even with gentler care and encased in silicone armor.  I think Nikon has some sort of quality control problem with its digital cameras.  It's very unusual for an electronic product to fail within the first year and incredible that two would fail in a row.  I can't trust Nikon anymore to deliver a reliable product that I know will be there when I'm taking once in a lifetime images.  Nikons are no camera to take on a wedding or a foreign vacation.This will be the last Nikon for me.  I may try Canon next and see if they are any better.""
"20111110","5.0","Great Camera","I debated for a long time before buying a camera.  Several of my friends had Canon and one had Nikon.  I was most concerned about being able to exchange lenses sometimes.  However, my friend with the Nikon noted that the kit lens that came with the Nikon was [in his estimation] a better lens.  So I went with Nikon and also bought a 35mm F1.8 fixed focal length lens because I wanted something fast for indoor/low light situations.  I have been very pleased with the camera as well as the both lenses.""

"20111109","5.0","An Excellent Pro-sumer grade camera","The D5100 was purchased as an upgrade from the Nikon D40.  I must say that it was money well spent and a great step up.  As a co-worker told me about this camera, 'It just takes great pictures!'  It's true.  With the Scenes settings, you can make things very simple and allow the camera to adjust to the type of shot you are making.  It will do so very well.  If you're more of a hands-on/advanced type, there are plenty of ways for the photographer to take full charge of the settings to manipulate the shot.  The first day I got this, I took it to a nightclub to shoot a band.  Paired with a Tamron 18-270mm zoom lens, I was really stunned at how good the shots turned out.I couldn't be happier with the purchase and would definitely recommend this model.""
"20111109","4.0","Great Camera","I bought my D5100 in September of 2011 and not from Amazon.Overall I am very pleased with its abilities and the quality of the images it produces.It came with a DVD that was very well done which has tutorials on some of the key features of the D5100. It does an excellent job in low light situations as long as the subject is not moving. I photographed our indoor bowling tournament with no flash, under available light, and the results were quite good. The HDR (High Dynamic Range)is useful and does a great job. Many of the D5100's features I have yet to explore.On the downside, the LCD screen is nearly impossible to see in direct sunlight. The continuous focus doesn't handle subjects moving from one side to the other, and the selective color effect isn't pure. The battery does not last as long as you would think. If you are photographing anything important, a second battery is a must.None of these issues are a deal breaker for me, and I would recommend getting a LCD protector and UV filters to protect the lense.I would definitely recommend this camera.""

"20111108","5.0","Utterly amazing camera-read here if you're trying to decide","I just left the world of Point and Shoot digital and had a Panasonic Lumix FZ35. It had the highest frames per second of comparable cameras when I purchased it last year. It also has HD recording capabilities. This Nikon arrived today and with only touching the basics of how to operate, my photos turned out amazing! My main reason for purchasing a DSLR was to take action shots of my daughters during their sports. I've never been so impressed or pleased with a purchase. Every shot was clear, crisp and mid-air shots were perfect. I could easily blow these up to poster sized with fantastic results.I researched for days and narrowed my choice down to the Nikon D3100, D5100 and the Sony A55. The Sony had the highest frames per second (10), but it wasn't reviewed as highly as the Nikons for overall camera and photo quality. The D5100 has a good size, easy to use controls, the neatest feature is the photo selection piece where you can snap a photo and the camera picks out the dominant color and makes everything else black and white.I was new to the DSLR and interchangeable lenses and overwhelmed. I ordered the 18-55mm lens and wasn't sure how close or how far I could get good shots. I'm able to get pretty close up, but I will definitely upgrade to the 50-200mm or 50-300mm lens for my kids' running and swimming events. Another notable difference from point and shoot cameras is that you manually adjust how close or how far you want the lens zoom to be. No auto zoom on this camera. The auto focus is amazing and leaps and bounds over point and shoot at the speed I was shooting in Sports Mode.""

No noticeable downgrade in performance and no more errors due to the SD card.

But I do really love this camera.  For people just starting out like me - there are some good sites out there that go over the basics of DSLR photography and explains all the different settings.

I now have a functioning camera, but can't rate it higher due to the poor technical service.Update 11/11/11:  Nikon returned the camera, stating that the camera met specs and that my SanDisk memory card was defective.  Of course I had checked the memory card in another D5100 before returning my camera, and it was ok.  Nevertheless, I bought a new San Disk card, tried the camera, and experienced the same issue.  I called Nikon and returned the camera for warranty service once again, at their expense this time.I look forward to enjoying my new, highly rated D5100 - once Nikon returns it to me after warranty repair.  It was defective out of the box.  It would take a photo or two, then fail to recognize the memory card.  I would have to turn the camera off, remove and replace the memory card, and then be good for a few more photos before it failed again.

"20111019","5.0","Awesome D5100 - but could have been little better!","D5100 is a perfect camera for anyone who is upgrading from a point & shoot or entering to DSLR photography. There are many reasons why this camera is perfect1) Has D7000's sensor2) 11 focus points3) 1080p video(didn't like the auto-focus though)4) Side articulated LCD screen with 930k resolution5) 4 FPS is not bad6) Lower noise at higher ISO7) External mic8) IR remote supportI can go on and on. I have been in a confusion to choose between D3100, T2i, T3i, D5100, D90 & D7000. Since this is my first DSLR camera I spent most of my time in reading reviews and watching review videos to know what are the important features of a DSLR.D7000 is a pro camera with loads of features but my use is gonna be kinda limited for now thought I could use the money to invest in lenses.D90 is a better camera in all aspects when comparing to D5100 but it has old sensor and image quality isn't the best comparing to D5100. I needed a camera with good video quality too so D90 is also out of my list.D3100, its one of the best entry level camera with good picture quality, guide mode and video features but you will soon outgrow with D3100. It doesn't have few important DSLR features like bracketing, external mic, FPS & IR remote support which was top in my mind.T2i/T3i has lower hand when I compared the picture quality with Nikon D5100 and T2i's mode dial doesn't move 360 degree. But canon has MUCH better video quality, Built-in focus motor, larger pentaprism viewfinder, dedicated ISO button and still I went with D5100 because of the image quality, lower noise at higher ISO, beautiful color depth, longer battery life, more focus points, decent video quality, side articulated screen & enough functions for a DSLR newbie with this price range.My complaint is the D5100 body is kinda cheap plastic feel and its little small to my hands so I am going to get a battery grip. And yes I hate to go around with D5100's menus for each and every setting but I paid less for D7000's sensor and a decent pack of features for one of the best mid-level DSLR's around. No regrets!""
"20111018","5.0","Out Of The Box Review","I had a difficult time deciding between Nikon and Canon.  I own three Canons so I felt a little disloyal buying a Nikon, but comparing test photos I found here and elsewhere, Nikon seemed to win.  I'm new to DSLR so I can't comment on manual features and wow you with lots of photography jargon I have yet to learn.  I just wanted a camera that took beatiful photos!  My old Canon PowerShot G2 takes great photos too, except indoors, but at 4 MP, it was definitely time to upgrade!I like the feel of the camera.  It's not too heavy to carry around  but not cheap and plasticky feeling either.  Some of the less exepensive DSLR's have that cheapy feeling, so I decided to spend more to hopefully get better quality and I'm not disappointed.  Even with a heavy lense it remains balanced. I'm sure I'll get used to it but some of the buttons seem to be in less than intuitive locations.  I'm still getting used to the menu too.  Again coming from Canon, there's a learning curve but I'll get the hang of it.If you're like me and you're tired of the cruddy picture quality point and shoot cameras produce indoors, then this is what you're looking for!  Just the auto setting alone produces terrific results over all my other cameras.  Once I learn how to manually adjust, I'm sure I'll get even better results.  Now I have the ability to zoom in on my kids when they're on stage and not end up with a pixelated blurry mess.  Wish I had this when my daughter had dance recitals.I am going to Jamaica next month and I'm going to be putting this puppy to the test.  I'll update my review then and hopefully upload some gorgeous photos!""
"20111016","2.0","Nice at first glance, but a lot of defects below the surface.","First off let me say that if you criticize a camera on these boards you will be personally attacked by an army of jerks, so its not that easy. Just take that into account when you read glowing positive reviews. Noone's paying me to speak truth about a camera.I tested a 5100 and was not that thrilled by the camera. In fact, I returned it making sure not to get stuck with it.The shutter is quiet and fast, and the menu is well designed, but the buttons are arranged in a unique fashion that someone else mentioned is different from most other Nikon dSLRS, so using it and another would not be a seamless experience. The live-view screen is almost more trouble than its worth, but it's mandatory on an HD vidcam. Dealing with it, however, can be a hassle for stills, since you're inclined to turn it face in, and then you have to turn it back every time you monitor etc.The LCD is very large and pretty, but it's also quite vulnerable if you're involved in any sort of action or even travel. You have to watch the screen like a hawk. If you're shooting concerts or street where you raise your hands above the crowd, great, but is that worth the trouble the rest of the time? Maybe so, it does provide for different shooting styles, and getting low is great, too. For video, the screen is mandatory, but back later on the video...Finally, is there a reason the camera can't come with a screen protector? You have to buy one as an accessory, and Nikon's brand name ones are no longer made. So now I have to waste time tracking down a kludge solution which may damage the screen. You pay $700 for a camera and they can't include such a critical item that's hard to find that costs 2 bucks to make? Thanks Nikon.Beyond the great value for price, I find the default saturation setting to be really flat, so while VIVID is too much on other cameras, I find it mandatory on this one, which is odd. The shots do look great at that point. The focussing doesn't seem to be what it claims. It's good for moving objects, but average at range-finding up close, at least on my 18-135 DX lens. It doesn't hang, but it doesn't seem particularly accurate either. There's a limit to how many shots I can shoot testing, and my lenses are decent, but not top of the line, but the sharpness is not really there consistently. I've been attacked on this point. Let me just say that this camera focusses noticeably worse than the D40x. I dont care if people say its the same design. Its a much worse, less robust performer in the focussing dept, despite having more points.The 16MP doesn't seem like much if any improvement over my D40X.  Let the scoffing begin, but the JPEG processing on this one resultsin about the same quality in my ultra close-up comparisons. There is more data, (fewer shots per card), but the final is about 20% better. Besides, 10-16 would be 1.6 times better. I would say 1.3 times better, and still not sure. Fine lines are blurring more at the point of pixelization.With a few days spent on the video, I have to say it's pretty weak. The AF struggles, suffers even. You feel bad for your lenses being overworked.  I know this is as advertised, but the video AF is definitely below camcorder quality, although not any worse than my Canon Vixia in low light, which is really terrible. At least dSLR lenses can be manually focussed easily depending on the lens. Nevertheless, this is no point and forget vidcam, and my Vixia beats it hands down in daylight and overcast.What's even worse is that no matter what you set before you launch into video, it chooses the ISO for you. You can choose aperture, and you can make the camera stop adjusting exposure by locking AE, but you cannot make it stay in a low ISO in low light, and its low light video is too grainy to be used outside of personal footage.  It looks great on the LCD, and on Youtube videos, but full screen, it looks much worse. I have yet to make this camera shoot low light in a low ISO, which does not show up in EXIF data like stills.  The video stays the same quality no matter what kludge you try, and there are many out there, but people keep realizing that their video ends up the same no matter what.It is NOT a low-light miracle worker in video period.  Shooting video also mandates that you use battery-sucking Live-view, which stays ON until you stop) In room light or daylight, it does much better, but you still can't control the ISO.  Plus if you really like shooting video, you will need the $120 in AC adapters or several batteries, because I would say the battery does about 20 minutes in video. Honestly, it even looks small, although it does charge fast, in about 60-70 minutes, which is about 1/3 faster than my EL-9.This camera is a perfectly portable size, but otherwise a major disappointments. The D5100 is sold for a fair price but promises too much.  I wanted to make the video work somehow, and workarounds are fine, and it does shoot good daylight video, but a camera that takes my settings and then ignores them while pretending it's displaying them is just going to aggravate long term.  It is not the low light miracle worker its been sold as. Even stills are about a two-step improvement. I shot 1600 ISO tonight on my D40x and it looks about the same as 6400 in the D5100. That said, there's an unpleasant aspect to the 5100's grain when it shows up. It's too distinct from the background. It stands out. As I said, this sensor also has saturation and dynamic range issues.Just thinking about how this camera is marketed as the can-do even though it's sold to a clearly consumer market bugs me. I think most amateurs won't find these problems until spending a few months with the camera, and I find the entire process dishonest. Then again, it does a lot for the price by past standards. Just don't be fooled into thinking that workarounds will make this useful to a budding videographer for instance, let alone any type of semi-pro. It's the price it is for a reason.""

"20111015","5.0","Superb; amazing upgrade from D40","I have been shooting film semiseriously for 20+ years, and also did my own BW darkroom work. Four years ago, I finally gave in to the inevitable and bought my first camera the Nikon D40. I used it mostly for snapshots at first, but the quality was so good and the convenience so tough to beat that I found myself not shooting film much anymore. So I finally decided to take digital seriously and bought the D5100. I considered the D7000 as well, but finally decided I didn't want the bigger and heavier body, and would save the extra $400 to put into lenses.This $650 camera has a sensor that is reputed to be Nikon's best at the moment, except possibly the one in the top-of-the-line D3 that sells for 7-8 times more money.  I am shooting RAW +jpeg, and tweaking the RAW files in Adobe Lightroom 3. (I'm still learning my way around in the world of digital postprocessing. Luckily, Lightroom's controls are very intuitive for somebody who has done darkroom work.) Jpeg shooters should look into fine tuning the camera's Picture controls; you can find many interesting presets on the internet to tune the look. The 6-7 default modes are fine too, but you can add about 9-10 other 'looks.' Nikon's website has a nice tutorial on developing a custom 'look' for your photos.  You should also set the camera to correct lens distortions of various types.The image quality in the D5100 is quite incredible up to 800ASA, and rivals the best color films I have shot over the years. (This was not true for my old D40.) The quality drops a bit at 1600ASA, and drops more noticeably at higher speeds. One can still get usable snapshots at 3200 ASA.For the price this camera is an amazing deal. I also bought the 18-105 nikkor, and the 55-200nikkor (at $100 off with the Nikon promotion, it was too good to pass up). I have tested these lenses against my old manual focus nikkor (eg the 50/1.8 AIS) and find their image quality to be similar. The new lenses have a much higher minimum aperture than the old MF lenses, but on other hand have VR image stabilization, which allows a couple more stops of handholding ability. Thus I find little need to bring out the old manual focus lenses (except to get the occasional portrait with blurred background).Bottom line: I am really really excited about the image quality this camera gives with fairly inexpensive kit lenses, something we could only dream of 10 years ago.""

This is why I gave three stars for d5100 and 5 stars for T3i.""
"20111015","3.0","Does NOT work w/ EYE-FI","A good basic camera, but if you want it to work w/ an EYE-FI card, buy a Canon.  After 3 weeks of wrangling, reloading software, many exchanges and phone time w/ EYE-FI, they gave up and told me their card doesn't work w/ Nikons.  I checked w/ Nikon, they confirmed:'I am sorry but the techs at EYE-FI are correct. It will not work with Nikons and unfortunately there is no fix.'Seems odd, since the thing is EYE-FI equipped.  I wish I had known before purchasing.  Now you know.""
"20111014","5.0","Great camera, great photos, extremely happy 1st time DSLR user","As a first time DSLR user, I was a little unsure about buying this camera, wondering if it was overkill and I should just save the money and get a point and shoot. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Beautiful pictures, the video and sound in video mode are excellent, and it is so versatile. I've used it as just a point and shoot in 'auto mode' and it works beautifully. I've also been playing around in 'manual mode', using the very helpful user guide to instruct me, and it has been an awesome learning experience. I feel like a 'real' photographer! With the upcoming arrival of our 1st child, I have total confidence that Nikon D5100 will capture his first moments beautifully and fit any need we might have when taking pictures. Highly recommend.""
"20111013","1.0","Works great but fragile","Had camera five months.  Camera works fine.Dropped the thing.  It was in a heavy camera bag and not dropped far-a foot or two at most...no big deal for any 35mm film SLR and should be no big thing for this expensive camera.  Probably got no more than a gentle nudge.  But it is completely inoperable now....get an error message and nothing I do changes it.  NO APPARENT DAMAGE AND NO REAL FORCE EXERTED ON THE CAMERA IN 'THE DROP'.The thing is too fragile.  So I search on the Internet and find many people commenting on this 'I dropped my camera (same make and model  and it won't work.'....and they are talking about the same thing....not dropped on a street or sidewalk...not even dropped by itself...dropped in a nice big thick nicely padded carry bag....and poof it's broken.Now searching around how to get it fixed.  Camera is inoperable.  Good thing I'm not on an expensive vacation.  I'd be out of luck photography wise.So.....if the camera cannot survive what amounts to normal wear and tear.....normal bumps and jolts...without locking up and refusing to operate....what does it matter how good it is otherwise?  In engineering parlance....the camera is not 'robust' enough.  Plastic housing?  Maybe.  Lots of fancy features, screens that turn inside out...sure.....HD video...yah...but drop the carry bag a few feet and the thing stops working?Not good.  Not acceptable. After I find out it can't  be repaired or that I'm liable for cost of repair I'm likely to decide that this brand is no longer the 'exclusive' high quality, high status brand it once was.  Now it's a mass marketed popular consumer good sold in the millions that is trading on the former value of the name.  It's a shame considering how robust the old cameras of this brand used to be....take a lot of REAL abuse...not some little nothing drop in a padded bag...and keep working.Very likely I'll toss it and switch to another brand that offers reliability along with NECESSARY features.  My esteem for this brand is irreparably damaged.""

"20111012","4.0","the dslr has come a long way","Been shooting Nikon SLRs for 10 years. I started with the legendary Nikon FM2n film camera in B&W photography class. It was almost a purely mechanical camera, except there was a small lithium ion battery to power the meter. Back in the days of mechanical cameras, you had to stick in the film, pull out the tab and line it up with the notches, then use the level to roll it to the first shot. After every shot, you had to pull another lever to advance it. There were times when I didn't notch the film correctly and I'd end up taking all my pictures on one shot of the film; never knowing it until I got it developed. You also had to adjust the aperture and shutting speed manual with the two dials, while looking through your viewfinder trying to spot the +,0,- signs.  But taking pictures with mechanical cameras wasn't the hard part. It was all the time spent in complete darkness in a closet to unroll the film canister and dropping it in container to develop your film; all in the dark. If your solution wasn't mixed properly, your film would be overexposed or completely useless. Those were the times.Fast forward to the Nikon D5100 modern DSLR. It's not only a digital camera, it's also a digital camcorder, and a limited digital dark room that allows you to do some tuning on your photos in the camera itself. This camera starts up and gets shots off fast. If you don't like to think, put it in auto and it'll think for you. If you like to think 'a little', put it in Aperture mode and it'll calculate the shutter speed for you. I've had the D50 previously and I thought I would miss the ISO button, top LCD, and various other buttons. Once I get it started, I've concluded there were way too many bonuses that outweighed the cons of upgrading. The settings panel activted by the 'i' button allows you to change frequently used settings very quickly. In the D50 you had to drill down to these menu items. I only miss the ISO button but you can assign that to the terribly placed 'fn' button next to the flash. The 'record' button is also terribly placed btw. I'm fine with all the other placements of the buttons and the screen is just incredible on this. The 16MP sensor is outstanding in detail and low light shooting. The movie mode does not allow you to change F-stops or shutter speeds in the middle of recording. You must stop if you want to change those settings when shooting video. I find the auto focus picks up a lot of lens noise, best if you manual focus and the beautifully sharp screen makes it easy to MF indoors and in the shade. As for the software View NX2, it's not bad for developing RAW. It brings out good detail and shows you the picture it was meant to be seen. It does not have any noise removal features or sensor dust masking. It has most of the basic controls like exposure compensation, white balance, and cropping. It has no history feature. You can export the RAW as a loseless TIFF, where you can continue your editing in say Photoshop or Lightroom should you need advanced tools.Overall, a superbly designed camera.""
"20111012","5.0","Review Written for Beginner Photographers","I am a photography teacher in NYC and online. (See my Amazon profile for my website.) I teach beginner and intermediate photography students every week. I've also been a professional photographer for the last five years with images published in The New York Times, GQ, New York Magazine, Women's Wear Daily, The New York Observer, The Village Voice and Time Out New York.(This review is for beginner photographers.)If you're a beginner, you're most likely asking yourself: Nikon or Canon? Really, I feel confident in saying that you can't go wrong with either. I've used both brand's cameras extensively and find that they both offer amazing image quality with well-built, solid cameras that, if taken care of, will last decades. There are two differences between the cameras, though, that can be taken into consideration.The user-interface: If cameras were computers, Nikons would be PCs and Canons would be MACs. PCs are built for people not afraid of technology whereas Macs are built for people who want things super-easy. Nikons excel at customization options which means you'll see so many more options with the Advanced features of a Nikon than you will with a Canon. Canons, on the other hand, excel at ease-of-use for beginners. Canons offer less advanced options and can be easier to learn on. This can be frustrating down the line, though, once you've learned a lot about photography. At that point you may want all of the options that Nikon offers and be frustrated with your Canon. If you're someone who really likes to delve deep into your hobbies or if you're intent on becoming a professional photographer, I'd say a Nikon would be your best bet. If you're someone who wants to learn the basics of photography and only imagine yourself being a hobbyist, Canon would be a better option for you.Where Nikon excels: Flash photography. I often find myself in situations where I'm shooting event photography (weddings, movie premiers, benefits and galas) where I need to use a lot of flash. For this kind of photography, I'll always prefer to be shooting with a Nikon. Nikon's flash metering (how the camera magically decides how much light to fire out of the flash) is much more consistent than Canon's. You can take a Canon and shoot the same scene three times in a row with flash and all three images will be at different brightness levels. You can do the same thing with a Nikon and all three images will be wonderfully the same. If you're somebody who plans on shooting a lot with flash (indoor photography, event photography, etc.) you'll want to consider going with Nikon.Where Canon excels: Richness of colors. I've been in numerous situations where I've been on the red carpet taking the exact same picture as the photographer next to me. I'll have a Canon and the person next to me will have a Nikon. This has provided quite a few opportunities to compare the images side-by-side. What I've found is that the colors on the Canon's images look richer and make the image pop more. If I'm doing fine art photography (anything I'd like to someday hang in a gallery), I'll always want to be shooting with a Canon for this reason.If you're set on Nikon, there are three cameras you should be considering and it all comes down to what your budget is:D7000 $1,400 without lensD5100 $750 without lensD3100 $600 only available with lens(current prices as of 2/19/11)Here's what you get for spending extra money (each camera compared to the one below it):D3100 vs. D5100:The D3100 is an EXCELLENT camera so if you only have $550 to spend total on camera and lens then go out and buy this camera. You won't regret it. If you're considering spending more money, here's what you'll get from the D5100 in comparison:-Better performance in low light situations.-A higher resolution screen on the back of the camera so you can see your images more clearly and make out if they actually turned out well.-An external mic jack. (If you're planning on shooting video with an external mic, you'll want the D5100 over the D3100.)-A flip out screen (handy if you want to put your camera anywhere but at your eye level and be able to see what your camera is about to capture before you shoot it)-Faster continuous shooting. If you're often shooting sports or any fast moving subject, continuous shooting allows you to capture multiple images in a single second. The D3100 shoots at three frames per second whereas the D5100 shoots at four frames per second.-Higher ISO options. The D5100 offers one more stop of ISO than the D3100 does. If you don't know what ISO means (or what a stop is) just know that this allows you to more easily shoot images in low-light situations.-Longer battery life. The D5100's battery will last 20% longer than the D3100The two advantages of the D3100 over the D5100 are: less expensive and less weight. Whenever a camera is less expensive, it means you'll have more in your budget for the lens. The D3100 weighs 10% lighter and is 10% smaller than the D5100.D5100 vs. D7000:The D5100 is Nikon's latest and greatest and is even newer than the D7000. Phenomenal camera! If you're stuck, though, between the D5100 and the D7000, here's what you'll get by spending more money on the D7000:-More focus points. When using auto-focus, the D7000 will have an easier time focusing on what you want it to focus on.-60% longer lasting batteries.-Faster continuous shooting. If you're often shooting sports or any fast moving subject, continuous shooting allows you to capture multiple images in a single second. The D5100 shoots at four frames per second whereas the D7000 shoots at six frames per second.-Weather sealed. This means you can shoot with the D7000 in the rain.-Two memory card slots. This is really a cool feature. The D7000 has two memory card slots which means you'll be less likely to find yourself standing in front of a gorgeous scene with no more memory left.-Faster shutter speed. The fastest shutter speed on the D5100 is 1/4000th of a second; on the D7000: 1/8000th of a second. To be honest, I can't think of any practical reason why this would benefit you unless you're planning on shooting some really bright scenes like directly into the sun.Advantages of the D5100 over the D7000:-A flip out screen (handy if you want to put your camera anywhere but at your eye level and be able to see what your camera is about to capture before you shoot it)-Smaller and lighter: The D5100 is 10% smaller and 30% lighter than the D7000. This is something to consider if you plan on carrying your camera around with you a lot.-Less expensive so you can spend more on your lens!If I can clarify any of this, please email me!-JP Pullos, photography teacher, NYC and online (see my Amazon profile for my website)""

"20111006","5.0","GREAT PICTURES AND VIDEO - compare Nikon D5100 to Canon T2i","COMPARISON TO CANON:The Canon T2i was finicky and would stop recording if I didn't use the right brand and speed of SD card.  I sold it and replaced it with a Nikon D5100.  The first thing I noticed is the Nikon works well with nearly any SD card.My Canon had the upgraded 18-135mm kit lens.  The Nikon arrived with the 18-55mm kit lens, which, apart from less telephoto range, is actually a much sharper lens with less chromatic aberration in the corners of the frame than the Canon 18-135.PHOTOS:The Nikon takes sharper photos than the T2i (comparing the two lenses I had), despite having 16 megapixels vs 18 for the Canon.  The Nikon also has a one F-Stop advantage in low light, getting great pictures even at ASA 6400.  The T2i was good in low light.  The Nikon is great.  It just looks cleaner in low light.In the default standard setting mode, the color saturation and the contrast is a little bit less in the Nikon, but the image is more realistic.  The automatic white balance seems to be more accurate in the Nikon, getting truer whites in more types of lighting conditions without having to resort to manually setting white balance all the time.  Of course, both cameras have tons of control over the color and contrast.  The Nikon has infinitely more manual control over white balance, allowing you to dial in the perfect setting by hand with an X-Y color grid. The Canon has the usual half dozen presets.VIDEO:As with still photos, all the color and contrast characteristics are similar from the photo mode to the video mode.  It's here where the Canon wins out with it's more filmic saturation and contrast.  The Nikon wins out in sharpness, which may not make it look as pretty for films, but it is a more natural looking image for general video use.Both cameras max out at 1920x1080 resolution at 30 frames per second, and both have 24 frame film modes.  What's missing on the D5100 is the 720-60 frame mode found on the T2i.  In the 720-60 frame mode, video motion is silky smooth.  In 30 frame mode, it has a filmic looking stutter in the motion.  Some users prefer this effect.  But the Nikon, even though having only 30 or 24 frame modes, allows you to select high video quality or normal video quality.  Using the normal mode doubles your capture time on the SD card at the expense of barely more digital artifacting.The Canon allows you to control the ASA, the iris and the shutter speed manually in the video mode.  When set to fully automatic, the iris is very smooth when transitioning from light to dark subjects.The Nikon does not allow you full manual control over the iris in video mode, and the iris sort of steps through many ranges from light to dark.  It isn't a smooth transition in manual or automatic mode.  Since you can't lock down the exposure in video mode, the camera is not suited for advanced film makers who need total image control.  Too bad, because the Nikon doesn't cease up during the video shoot if you put class 6 or even class 4 SD cards in it.  The Canon will simply stop recording on it's own if it doesn't like the brand or speed of card you use.SOUND:Both cameras have an external mike jack and no headphone jack.  The Nikon has a few presets to eliminate or lower the AGC function and control the audio level.  The Canon has no control over audio levels and you can not defeat the AGC unless you buy special software that can re-program the camera's firmware (some users have frozen up their cameras doing this the wrong way).CONTROLS:I found the Canon easier to program than the Nikon, especially in video mode.  The Nikon takes some experimenting (or reading the dreaded instructions) to discover the extra layers of image control it possesses.  Once you delve in and learn the menu, there's far more intricate image control with the Nikon.With the Canon, you set it to video mode, turn it on and press the red button to begin recording video.  The Nikon requires the extra step of setting the live view mode each time you power it up, while the Canon can be left in the video mode all the time.The image stabilizer in the Canon is better for walk-around hand held shooting than the Nikon, providing much smoother shots in the steady hands of a seasoned user.SUMMARY:I liked the Canon better for it's filmic look and ease of use, but I value the Nikon for it's better low light performance, sharper image and most of all, it's total reliability and not being dependent upon the choice of SD card.""
"20110929","3.0","good will refund?","Ordered the D5100 as a birthday gift for my wife. Everything arrived well packaged, but we did not power up the camera until she opened on her birthday (a couple of weeks later).  Immediate dissapointment to learn the 'live view' would not engage and the camera would not capture pictures.  Called Amazon to exchange defective camera for replacement only to be told I would have to return it for refund then order another one - even after repeatedly requesting an exchange.  Amazon refunded my purchase price minus about $104 for what they called shipping, promotion discount, restocking, etc.  I immediately questioned this with Amazon explaining again that I should not have to be punished to the tune of $104 because I got a defective camera.  Amazon did then credit my Amex the $104, but classified it a 'good will refund'.  We reordered the D5100 and this one seems to be working fine. Will update when the camera has seen some use - hopefully can then give a review on the camera.""
"20110928","5.0","Perfect for a beginner!","I am a complete dSLR beginner.  I took an undergrad photog class in the days before dSLR, and learned the basics of SLR photography.  Of course, I have forgotten all of it, but it is all slowly coming back to me and this camera is definitely going to grow with me as I learn more about the finer points of dSLR photography.  Right off the bat, this camera took beautiful pictures.  We have a five month old baby and I was just so sick of mediocre point and shoot pics.  Literally, I unpacked the camera and within 5 minutes was taking my first pictures.  Wow are they gorgeous pics!  It's very easy to use and beginner friendly.  The battery came precharged.  It is the perfect size and weight.  It will easily travel with us and is not at all a burden to carry.  We are just so happy with this!""
"20110928","5.0","Coming from a Prosumer Compact","There are several really detailed reviews of the D5100 on here so I thought I would give my views coming from a high end compact (the ones that shoot raw; manual controls, etc).The sensor makes a world of difference.  It is bigger and far more sensitive than you'll find in a compact.  Using the Auto-ISO feature you can let the camera run all the way up to ISO 6400 and shoot in some very low light.  Above 3200 you'll want a program to de-noise the images though.  Obviously the camera is bigger, bulkier and heavier than a compact.  It isn't going to fit in your pants pocket as you run out the door.  You're probably thinking that is obvious and you're right but that is a consideration.  The ability to change lenses and to have a real sense of being able to control depth of field leads to much nicer photos in the right hands.  This camera offers a lot more options than a compact and it is tremendously faster to shoot with.  Not only because it tends to shoot faster, but because the controls are more accessible.The newest trend to be mirror-less cameras and Nikon just announced their '1' series which does have a substantially smaller sensor than this.  It also has smaller lenses but I still don't think it'll fit your pocket heading out the door.  I also don't think the'll get the battery-life of this camera (which is better than any camera I've ever had).  However it is a consideration.In the end I'm extremely happy with this camera.  There are times I wish I could slip it in my pocket and head out the door (it now comes along in a nice backpack) but I bought this to have a better tool in taking photos.  It absolutely meets that goal.""
"20110927","4.0","You'll need CS5 to work with Raw images","Just one thing I can add to the reviews: The Nikon 5100 has a new type of Raw images that is not, and will not, be supported by CS4 and earlier versions of Photoshop. This is a huge disappointment to me as I spent my whole budget on camera, and wasn't prepared to buy a new version of Photoshop just to be able to work with Raw images.""
"20110923","5.0","Great Camera","05 Feb 2012 UPDATE.WORTH THE PRICE I PAID WITHOUT QUESTION!!There was only 1 picture that I took of 345 at Disney World that was not good. OPERATOR ERROR!!The best way to describe this camera is to compare it to a car.  You had and older car it had the normal stuff a/c heat,radio.  The new ones have buttons to adjust the seat mirrors, temp for one or more drivers.  This camera is the same idea..there are many things the camera can do and will do for you that were not available on older cameras.  Just like the newer car with all the special features and gadgets.You have to use/play with them to truly understand how they work.  There are many 'auto' settings where the camera does the work for you, but you can also choose to take some pictures the way you want to.I bought this camera because I wanted to get a picture of my grandson performing at Radio City.  His school chorale was pefroming as a 'warm-up' for the Rocketts. I wanted get at least one picture of he and his partner dancing.Yes I was able to get a fantastic picture under much less than desiredable conditions.  As I stated at the top of the update.  This camera is worth every cent.I wanted to get pictures of him while they were doing a dance routine.  The conditions for being able to get the idea place for taking picures of them was not the best.  Pople were still coming into and getting their seats at the start of their performance23 September 2011.I will be adding to this review in the future.For the best review that I have seen personally (this review was the one that put me over the edge to buy this camera) go to the review that was written by Alan Montgomery on August 17th.My review will be slanted toward a 'senior' age level as that is where I am.I have had some experience with SLR as I have a Pentax K1000 35mm film camera.It has taken many great pictures but I felt it was time to move up to digital.  In 2007 I bought a Sony DSC-H5, basically for a vacation in Hawaii.  It is basically a point and shoot with a great telephoto lens. But being a point and shoot it was somewhat limited, which I did not have a problem with at that time.That is why I now have the D5100, as with grand children, getting involved in difference activities I found myself needing a camera that was capable of taking pictures in low light situations, which the Sony was not that good at handling.For me personally the learning curve on this camera is somewhat intimidating.  Again the best way to learn is the old 'hands on'.  The documentaion that came with this package is very informative and definitely gets you headed in the right direction.I will be in Disney World for a week in October and will up date when I have time upon return.""
"20110919","5.0","Good camera for little price","I own the D3100 and I purchased the D5100 to have a second camera.  I use the D3100 for my telephoto lens and the D5100 for my regular lens. That was the main reason to buy it, but I also love the AEB and HDR features on the D5100.""
"20110918","5.0","Nikon D5100 Digital SLR Camera","All I can say is that this is an AWESOME camera. I love the pictures, the body style, and the weight. Pictures are unbelievable! I had the D3100 and it was nice but the D5100 is truly amazing! I love the pictures.""
"20110918","5.0","Worth every Penny!","This is my first SLR camera, and it took a lot of research to decide on this one. It;s in the top three greatest purchases I Have ever made! Besides the obvious factors of upgrading from a 5 MP Sony cyber shot, this thing just simply amazes me at the clarity and definition of the photos. I have fell in love with the auto-bracketing feature to create HDR shots. I have yet to try the video however, so when I do I will update the post.""
"20110915","4.0","Better than a point and shoot","To be fair, after two weeks playing with it and now comparing it to a newly arrived D7000, I have to say that for non-technical shooting and general snap-shots, this is a nice little camera.  In most cases, its photos are indestiguishable from the D7000, and that is the bottom-line in 95% of the cases.  Both cameras outperform anything Nikon has put out in the prosumer range prior to this.  I loved my D90 and used it more than my D300, which I now only use for studio work, or when I might get banged-up in the field.  The D7000 performs better than the D300 and it's lighter.  The D5100 is still close, but with such limited options, it just isn't as versatile or adaptable as the others.I got a tongue-lashing for caring about a depth of field button, but professionals use selective focus a lot!  The focus array on the D5100 seems adequate, but I found two situations today where the D7000 did a better job.  I'm going to take both bodies out to shoot aspen and the rut tomorrow.  We'll see how they do in a real work situation.  I'll probably use the D5100 for wide angle and macro shots.  I'll use the D7000 for big, fast lenses that might be too much for a plastic body.I haven't tried movie mode or some of the other features of either camera.  The 'special effects' menu looks like toyland, and I doubt anyone serious about photography would use them.This is a decent camera.  I like its size, but not its handling, even with a vertical grip.  The 'Live View' is not particularly impressive, especially outdoors in the sun.  The 16 MP feature is overkill in most situations.  After 10MP, more is not necessarily better...unless you have very special purposes.  We just tend to be memory gluttons on electronics in general.  I have a 65' TV and past 1900 or maybe, 2400 pixels, it's overkill.  When was the last time you printed a 30'X40' print?In the end, it is what it is...A nice, simple camera that takes decent photos without a lot of hassle.""
"20110915","5.0","No doubt better than a d90","Bought this on line at Amazon and it came very quickly.  Had already used the Nikon D90 for a while, and wanted to try this one.  Read on line many debates as to which were better. I sold my two used D90s and extra batteries and two charges one day or two after moving up to the 5100.  Turned out my used equipment payed for the new camera.  Guess that means I am voting the the 5100 is better.  Main thing is the sparkling color.  Though I might be called a semi professional amature, I like the simpler controls.  After a little practice after using the D90s so long, I find the d5100 easier to navigate.  I use the 70-300 nikon vr lens and the 18-105 vr lens on mine.  One complaint was that the d90 was heavier than the 5100.  With the long telephoto i am really glad the d5100 is lighter.  Note that the tilt out viewer on the back is a very positive feature, when you get used to it.  Also note that if you buy a film to put over that viewer, to protect it, you can not fold the viewer back closed.  All in all a very serious and easy to use camera and well worth the investment.""
"20110915","5.0","Awesome Camera!","I got this camera just before my daughter's birthday.  The picture quality is excellent even in low light! I haven't tried various modes yet but it works perfect out of the box in auto mode.  The consignment arrived on time from Amazon without any issues.""
"20110915","4.0","A comparison of the D5100 against the older D50","This review is geared for those considering replacing an older Nikon DSLR with the newer D5100.  If that's not you, there are other reviews here that are more comprehensive.I'll start by saying video features mean nothing to me personally so I'm speaking to the photography side of the D5100.  My reference point for these comments is my trusty Nikon D50 which I still love but decided to replace mostly to see if Nikon has moved their technology forward in the seven years I've owned the D50.Pros: the D5100 is a bit smaller, lighter, quieter and faster.  The BIG high resolution screen is a huge help.  HDR mode is great for occasional use and was one of the reasons I chose the D5100 over the more expensive D7000.  Its huge memory buffer and 4 frames per second are a real treat, at parties w/o flash you can 'appear' to take just one picture of your subject, but in reality you took 15 and they don't know it - pick from the best and you usually have the shot.  The rotating display with live viewing is a huge plus for holding the camera over your head in a crowd and getting the shot.  The ability to 'code' all your images with a digital fingerprint invisible to the viewers' eyes (such as your email address) is a big plus.  The D5100's enormous memory pretty much only matters to video users or those shooting at full res - I keep mine stepped down to small file sizes but still it's nice to know I could go a whole year without maxing out the camera's memory.  The ability to handle contrast is notably better with the D5100.  I use Google's wonderful Picasa for all my photos, and previously loved its 'I'm feeling lucky' feature for all my work with the D50.  Now with the newer D5100, the images are so darned good that even Picasa can't make them prettier.  That's impressive.  No complaints about the menus, they all make sense.Cons: even with a fairly hot 35mm f1.8 lens the camera's autofocus is slow or inoperative under tough lighting situations - just like about every other autofocus camera I've used so this is not breaking news.  There's no way to charge the battery with a USB cable, and to my great surprise this camera's battery life is LOWER than my older D50.  The charger is tiny and light but good luck if you forget it on your trip.  Nikon says 600 shots per charge and that might be about right - but it's disconcerting to see that after 150 shots the battery meter is no longer pegged to the right.  In all the years I owned the D50 I never once had it go dead, but in a mere month with the D5100 it already happened.  I'll learn to watch that more closely and it'll be fine, but never the less it was a surprise.If you're still curious about this great camera do yourself a favor and look at what Ken Rockwell has to say about it: (...)""
"20110914","5.0","AMAZING. Makes me look like a professional photographer.","I bought this camera to use in a professional capacity. I do marketing and communications for an NGO in Haiti and I've also done some work for an NGO in Afghanistan. I use it to capture photos and video to use in a marketing materials and communications for these organizations. Before I got the Nikon I was using a Canon Rebel XS 10.1 MP SLR and a separate Sony video camera. It was completely cumbersome and inefficient -- I wasn't working to my full potential in either photography or videography because of it. And although I was initially skeptical of a photo/video combination SLR, the sheer convenience of the idea won me over.Let me stress that although I purchased this camera to use in a professional capacity I am not a professional photographer (whatever that means these days). But I swear with this camera I could be a staff photographer on National Geographic. I've photographed and shot some really interesting environments under harsh conditions and this camera turned everything into pure magic. The video quality is even better than what I got with a standalone video camera. You get stunning photographs and crystal clear video with bright, vivid colors at the push of a button.And although I can't say enough good things about this camera, I do want to point out a few tips that potential buyers should be aware of:1. The battery life on the video is really, really short. I had a backup battery that I kept in my bag fully charged and there were many days where I went through two batteries in the first half of the day. I eventually learned to manage my time a bit better and only film when I really thought it was needed, but I prefer not to have to work like that -- you never know what you might need later on. So I would highly suggest buying at bare minimum one extra battery if you plan to use this for anything more extensive that facebook video uploads.2. Watch out for the auto focus on video mode. I wouldn't exactly say it's auto focus because on quite a few occasions the camera failed to auto focus or auto focused on the completely wrong thing in video mode. By the end of my first 3-week trip with this camera, I had learned the tricks to it: Like switch to photo mode on auto focus then back to video mode if you want to be sure it's focused, or just use manual focus if you know you'll be shooting a more or less fixed object. This was by far my biggest gripe with this camera.3. The built-in mic is surprisingly good -- although I could see it being a problem for people who are picky about their sound. I was on the move all the time working in an austere environment, so I didn't want to bother with an external mic and the built-in sufficed. And I didn't feel like dropping another $200 on an external mic. But I may make this investment in the future.4. It gets heavy. That's not to say this isn't a light, compact camera for what it does -- it definitely is. But I'm petite and found it a bit of an awkward challenge to hold this camera in the right position when shooting. Why didn't I use a tripod? Again, because I was on the move so much, shooting things that were happening in a chaotic environment. With a video camera, this wouldn't have been a problem -- I would have either been shooting off the shoulder or using a handycam. But with this you've got to hold it out. And it definitely gets tiring.5. Don't forget to buy a gigantic, high-speed memory card for the video.6. I initially bought a gray market version of this camera online. I had no idea what that meant until my friendly neighborhood camera shop owner told me what it meant. I ended up returning it and re-buying it, basically at full retail, at a camera shop. Was this necessary? Probably not. I could have saved myself the $100. But, like I said, I in and around some pretty harsh and unpredictable environments and the camera can take a beating. I wanted the peace of mind of knowing that if something happened, I could bring it back to the U.S. and get it fixed without any problems. I would encourage any buyer to do their research on this issue before making a purchase from any seller. I'm not accustomed to dropping $1,000 bucks on one item so I wanted to be really careful.But anyway I am completely enamored with this camera. It was worth every penny.""
"20110908","5.0","Superior "starter" DSLR","I bought this camera because my wife and I had a son on the way, and nothing is better than pictures of a newborn's tiny fingers and toes.  I've been a casual amateur photographer for 20+ years -- from my dad's Minolta SR-T 101 through a long series of point-and-shoot digital cameras.  I wanted to step back up to a camera giving me control over my images, and this allows me to do everything I can think of with a lot of success.  The bottom line is the D5100 takes awesome photos for me.  I have no doubt a more expensive camera will take better photos, but for me the amateur dad obsessing over his newborn it is entirely unnecessary.Pros: In auto mode, it's a point and shoot that produces far better results than any other camera I've owned.  In manual mode it gives me complete control over my images just as I expect.  High ISO is incredible, not nearly as noisy as I expected.Cons: It's not weather sealed.  I don't have anything else negative to say about the camera.  The biggest con is that it makes me want to buy faster lenses, a fancier flash, an endless list of accessories, and now I need a bigger hard drive to store all these images!""
"20110907","5.0","amazing.","This is my first DSLR and im absolutely in love with it!! I chose this camera for its ease of use, and the fact that is has the same sensor as the more expensive nikon d7000. I shoot all sorts of things, landscape, nature, concerts and it delivers 100%. the start lens is ok, but i ended up buying the 50mm f/1.8 lens (which is awesome) for anyone who is still learning photography, i think this would a great camera for you. has a ton of scene features and modes. keep in mind that it DOES NOT have an auto focus pin build into the body, so you will have to use lenses with 'AF-S' in them. the swivel screen is a nice feature to have, even tho i dont use it too much. i have zero complaints with this camera and highly recommend it.if you are curious as to what the pictures come out looking like here is my website:[...][...]""
"20110905","5.0","D5100 fills a missing niche","For those of you that want a DSLR camera without the weight of a D300 or D3 or D7000 then this camera is the one. Much better than D3100 with larger screen and higher resolution. I put a 70-300mm on it too and it is a little small on the end of that big lens but it works great.I note that the D5100 vs the D300s lacks the remote master flash option for controlling other SB flashes but I am not going to rely on infrared and will use radio frequency transmitters. Considering the price and features, this is Nikon's best deal by far.""
"20110830","5.0","Great camera! Very happy with purchase!","This is my first DSLR camera, and so far I love. We've taken about 500 pictures so far and have gotten some incredible photos that I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to capture without the advanced abilities of this camera.There is definately a bit of a learning camera, even coming from an 'Advanced P&S' camera like the Canon G series, but the payoff is definately worthwhile. I was able to get some great stop action shots of my son during a TKD demonstration while he was in midair and also just at the split second when he was breaking a board and his foot had just cracked the board - absolutely priceless shots!The camera seems to take very nice HD video, although I haven't played with that a lot as it was not my intended use of this camera. It is nice to have the option though if I don't have our HD camcorder with us and want to take video.""
"20110828","5.0","Wonderful camera for beginner","I have not used an SLR camera for over 20 years.  I received the camera perfectly packed.  Set up was effortless.  I was able to take great pictures immediately using the auto settings.  With the help of Lynda.com and D5100 for Dummies I was using this camera like a pro in a month.  This camera is set to save pictures in jpeg but you can change it to save them in RAW format or both jpeg and raw formats.  I had no idea what raw format was when I bought this camera but the post production changes I can make using raw is amazing.  One thing to know is that not all memory cards are the same.  The faster the card the faster you can take pictures using the continuous picture mode.  I highly recommend this camera.""
"20110827","5.0","Excellent camera for many uses","First dslr camera purchase and I have to say it was money well spent. The picture quality is amazing with 16.2mp, and 1080 hd video quality is not to be overlooked. The camera controls are a bit tricky but that's why you purchase a camera with so many functions. Certainly not only for point and click, but has auto features that would trump any consumer level camera. I recommend setting aside some extra cash to purchase other lenses so that you can really appreciate this camera. Packed with the 18-55 mm lens, this camera is a definate must have for any beginning photographer.""
"20110826","4.0","Nikon D5100 Great product- Amazon price match sucks..","Nikon D5100 is one of the better cameras for the price it is offered at. This camera has excellent picture quality and video capabilities. The only issue with Amazon is they reduced the price in 2 weeks and they dont do a price match. Customer service is pathetic and they do not even try to understand the reason for calls and say they cant do any price matches once shipped. Every retailer in US does a price match and amazon doesn't. This was a bad experience with Amazon which unlike bestbuy doesn't have good price match options or customer service. After pruchase options are always good in Bestbuy and i feel few bucks for tax shouldn't lean me towards amazon going fwd.""

"20110823","5.0","Excellent camera for novice and experts","I purchased the camera just a few days before my road trip to some National Parks. The image quality is just stunning. Contrary to what some websites like snapshots say, the battery lasts for about 500 photos only, but it is possible that it had to do with all the new settings and tricks that I was trying about throughout the trip.I was impressed that I saw so many other tourists (easily over a hundred) from Europe who also had the same camera. I don't want to get into the technical details, as many others have already elaborated before me, but I don't regret this purchase at all, and I am looking to add more lenses to my kit-bag for future use.""
"20110823","5.0","VERY GOOD PURCHASE","Got my D5100 a wk. ago and it was a very good purchase.You can't just plug the camera into your computer and have the memory card show up on your desktop as a disk thereby giving access to images.But after research I saw a suggestion and bought the: 'Transcend TS-RDP5K USB 2.0 Card Reader' and when I used that to plug the camera's SD card into my computer I could see the disk and contents on my desktop!I hadn't seen this mentioned in any of the previous reviews.Always happy to contribute & etc.As always, glad to be 'struggling' with these dire first world issues: God Bless our freedom loving friends in Libya.""
"20110819","5.0","Great","This has been great so far, still learning.  The video is ok but really didn't buy it for the that.  It will get used for some video and for that it will be fine I am sure.Would highly recommend this camera.""
"20110818","5.0","The HDR works","I was on the market to purchase a DSLR when D3100 & D7000 were just released. I pre-ordered both then dropped D7000 due to its high price. I regret this decision until D5100 came up. However, after reading a review from the Nikon D5100 w/ kit lens, I paused for a while to purchase this camera. The review was 4-star, talking about the swivel screen, HDR in camera processing, and feel cheap.But now, the price of D5100 is down to a level that I can't resist. For the price of one D7000, I can have both D3100 & D5100 give and take of $100. I have many lenses and accessories in common. D3100 is a good back-up system.To defense the previous review arguments, I list my personal favorable reasons as following.(1) I use a screen protector on the swivel screen and flip it out all the time. I don't worry about it being scratched. After swivelled use, I reset it to this normal position immediately.(2) HDR in camera process works quite well. It is better than Photoshop HDR 3-photo process. Many people are frustrated with SONY's HDR process. They feel that the processed images are too artifact. Not here with Nikon. I posted 2 images on this product's photo with notes. The key of getting the good image is steady hands or using a tripod. Use spot-metering instead of matrix metering is also a good tip. Just a reminder, assigning the fn button for HDR will make it one button prcess, not 6-7 press keys process like previous reviewer pointed out.(3) Lighter camera is a trend now. D5100 weights 3/4 of D7000. For a non-professional photographer like me, it saves me a lot of shoulder grease.""

"20110817","5.0","Great Camera","Lots of features.  Good camera for the beginner who wants a camera that will not limit them in the future and has many features for the professional as well.  Large screen which folds away when not needed.  Will save photos in BOTH JPEG and RAW.  I did a lot of research before buying and this camera beat competitors in features and performance.  I would recommend a card reader however.  The rubber cover over the cable connections seems a little flimsy.  I decided to get a card reader instead of toggling the cover over and over again.  Other than that - love it.""
"20110815","5.0","Best camera I've ever owned.","I've owned several Nikon and Canon cameras, and camera lenses, over the years. This Nikon D5100 camera is the best I've ever owned. I purchased it from Amazon a couple of months ago, with the 18-200mm lens. I highly recommend this combo. The 18-200mm lens is superb - very fast and sharp throughout the range. If you own this lens, you will need no others. I used to use a 400mm lens for bird photography, a  200mm macro lens for insect photography, and smaller lenses for general photography. The 18-200mm lens replaces all of them. 16.2 megapixel images taken with the D5100 camera and 18-200mm lens combo are so pixel-dense that you can severely crop a photo of a bird or insect and still have a very sharp high-resolution photo. Of course, normal photos of family, friends, pets, landscape are also superb - sharp, with beautiful color.""
"20110814","3.0","Dissapointing","I have owned a number of Nikon DSLRs and I feel this might be the worst yet.  The colors produced by this camera are horrible with terrible skin tones and strange color shifts.  The OOC images are very soft.  High ISO noise handling is excellent as long as you shoot JPEG.  It's a good camera overall, but Nikon has ruined it's IQ  formula.  I switched to Canon for the first time in 10 years and couldn't be happier.""
"20110813","5.0","Great camera for the Point-and-shoot photographer upgrading","This review is not going to cover the specs and advanced features of this camera because others have done that with far greater finesse than I could ever manage. If that is what you need or want, then please move on to the next review.  I am going to focus on the advantages for someone moving from a point and shoot to this DSLR camera. I have seen comments posted on the web from serious photographers who question why a rank amateur would want anything more than a point and shoot and would like to address those concerns.  First of all, this is a teaching camera.  You can learn from it and your skills will advance, no matter how humble the skills are in the beginning.  In the process of learning, the camera is idiot proof so you will still get great pictures in spite of your lack of sophistication.  Secondly, if you have a home with poor lighting, this camera will do far better than any point and shoot that I have ever used.  Thirdly, if you don't want to win photography awards but it is still important to you to accurately capture the beauty of whatever it is that you love, this is a great camera. I love to take pictures of my cats, dogs and wildlife on my rural property.  This camera, in very bad lighting, accurately takes pictures of my cats' beautiful eyes.  I don't need fancy filters, lenses, flashes or lighting.  The color is not off and you don't get red eye, blue eye or no eye.  I don't really have to do a whole lot of advanced adjusting to accomplish this.  Also, the kit lens is much, much better than I expected for my needs.  My cats' coats with subtle but beautiful color markings are accurately captured with this camera and kit lens.  I have cats that I have taken pictures of for years and never got a good shot of until I got this camera.  I got my first great picture of one of my black cats in poor lighting.  I have shown that picture to many friends and posted it on Facebook and no one can believe that the photo was taken in such lousy lighting.  The thing about pets is they do their cutest stuff in the darkest corners of the room.  I have loved that feature the most about this camera.  It is an easy camera to use.  It is well made and idiot proof when it comes to removing the battery, sliding the SD card in and out, changing from photo to video.  Nothing is awkward.  My last point and shoot had a lot of 'quirks' when putting in batteries and the SD card. No such quirks here.  No hard to close hinges.  Everything works as it should.  For a beginner, this is not something to be taken lightly.  Some of us get frustrated rather easily.  You can concentrate on learning how to take better pictures rather than how to make the camera work.  The menu is idiot proof.  No quirks there.  Very common sense and intuitive.  The camera display is very, very sharp.  Very easy to view pictures.  You can do some editing of the photos before you load them onto your computer which is sometimes very, very helpful.  You will become a better photographer for having this camera.  In the process, you will have a lot of fun and get great photos--all without any frustration.One thing I forgot to add, the battery life is wonderful.  It was 2 months before I had to recharge. I took about 600 photos at my leisure during that time.  That alone is worth the price of the camera.I have to add that I love the colors that this camera picks up. I have ten years of pictures of my gersman shepherd lab who is a reddish gold color.  I just went over all the pictures I have of her.  Those taken with point and shoots, cell phones, even on two 'professional' photographer's photos and the pictures taken by the Nikon D5100 are washed out and dull.  Only the the Nikon D5100 captures the deep red/gold hue accurately.  I hold a picture next to her, the Nikon pictures are so much like her that I cannot tell any difference whatsoever.  I really love this camera.""
"20110812","5.0","My Nikon D5100 from Amazon and","It's a beautiful camera!  I am still learning just some of the features - I had used a Minolta 35mm film SLR for 9 years, often in either aperture priority or manual, sometimes in P mode.  The D5100 has all these capabilities and much much more.  I would recommend that a new owner immediately go to the Nikon site and download the D5100 Reference Manual (about 250 pages) and save it in PDF format on your computer for when you need it.  If you later want to print the manual (I did), you'll need to input your D5100 S/N.  I used the PDF print capability to print full size pages because I wanted the bigger print.  Then I spent 20 minutes punching 3 ring binder holes and bought a decent large 3 ring binder to hold all these pages.  You can certainly learn to operate the D5100 from the User's Manual that comes in the camera box, I just like to have the ref. manual on the computer for questions I might have.I am not any kind of expert so can't compare this camera with previous DSLRs (my wife has a D40).  Nikon has always seemed to be the best (to me) so choosing Nikon  was a no brainer.  I read the reviews and decided that I'd rather pony up and get the mid priced D5100 rather than the entry level D3100.  We got a f/4-5.6G, IF-ED, AF-S, DX 55-200mm VR lens with the D40 (because I knew I wanted it) so I have that to use with my D5100 for nature shots in Florida.  I may get a 50mm f1.8 for nice close pics of bugs and flowers in low light and short depth of field.  Gotta pay for D5100 first though.I really like this camera and expect that it will be my last camera (unless there is a new technology innovation as dramatic as going from 35mm SLR to DSLR was for me).""

"20120527","4.0","Nikon D5100 Body Only frm amazon","I purchased the Nikon D5100 to become my primary camera in place my D40.  The D5100's Vari-Angle is a major plus and each of my D40 autofocus lens fit it.  The Vari-Angle allowed me the ability to take photos in large crowds when you cannot view the subject through the standard view finder.  This happen recently in Europe when using the D40 to take photos of a well know celebrity and I just didn't capture the subject because I had hold the D40 well over my 6'-3' head with no ability to view the subject.  In addition, the 1080 movie taking feature isn't bad either.  I recommend the Nikon D5100 because it is one of the finest cameras I have ever owned.""
"20120523","5.0","Improvement on D 80","Right out of the box using the same lens (18 - 200 VR)this camera takes better pictures than my previous Nikon D80. I bought the body only. I am a family photographer and the D5100 is the  ideal Nikon camera for me.  Simple to use, lightweight, video if necessary, and well priced.  I considered the D7000, but in reality, I would never use the added feature set and have instead bought a 35mm Prime lens and an extra battery and am still $300 ahead! Photos thus far have been great, without the frustration of obvious exposure issues I experienced with the D80.""
"20120521","5.0","Bought for Birding","This is easily the finest camera that I've owned and I've owned some good cameras hailing back to the Minolta SRT-201. I seldom use the viewfinder and instead tend to use the high contrast and very sharp monitor built into the camera. Focus is quick and accurate with the kit lens. Pictures are bright and color is very accurate.Vibration Reduction is better than I expected. With the camera on my tripod and VR off, I can tap the tripod and see the image resonate with the vibration in the tripod. With VR on, there is no discernable shake even with the 70-300mm lens on full zoom. Quite amazing actually. I can hear the VR mechanism working but it's not loud, just quietly working it's magic.With AF and VR on, it takes a second to take an image since everything has to stabilize before the picture is taken. Turning them off and doing manual focus allows a much faster process per picture.I also purchased a Tamron 70-300mm lens and all features work perfectly with this camera, both AF and VR (which Tamron calls VC) work pretty much the same on it and the kit lens.It's worth every penny. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. This camera makes ME smile.""
"20120520","5.0","Great Camera","Firstly, Amazon's delivery was very fast.  I had the camera 4 days after I ordered it with standard shipping.  Great job.The Camera itself is a great step up from what is now my secondary camera, the D60.  Focus is nice and crisp, and even on the Sports setting, the camera is lightning fast.  There is a lot to this camera, so read the manual first ! !  I also purchased a battery grip for it, and you will find that does make up for the camera's compact size (the only drawback I have encountered so far).Great job Nikon.""
"20120519","4.0","Still getting used to it","I upgraded from my Nikon D200 and even though so far I am liking the D5100, it's taking a little while to get used to.  The first difference is the size and weight.  The 5100 seems so small and light.  Not necessarily bad, just different.  I can definitely say that the Auto setting works really well, and most of the exposure problems I had with the D200 have gone away.  A lot of my photos at work are just quick group shots or events and it works great. I do like some of the Effects settings as well, although I think they should be used with caution because sometimes they go a little far with sharpening and contrast and you end of fixing them in Photoshop.Most of my lenses for my D200 either do not work or have limited function with the 5100.  For a majority of my portrait work, I use the Nikon 50mm and although it works with the 5100, there is no auto focus.  But, I must say, the focus bar on the 5100 is awesome.  I thought I would end up buying a new 50mm, but I think I can do without.  I also have the Rokinon 85mm and it doesn't work at all, I'll have to upgrade.I've only had it two weeks, but I think I'm going to like it.  Just going to take a little of time to figure it all out!""

I have used this camera in the field for more than two months and it has performed beyond expectation in every case. I added the Nikon 55mm/200mm zoom and I've had everything I need to capture the raw images required by official agencies, as well as some super candid shots of the crew at work. The movies are definitely icing on the cake.""

"20110807","5.0","Excellent quality pictures, and very easy to use","It was between purchasing this camera and another. I has asked a avid photographer which one he would pick, and he said the Nikon. I rechecked the reviews and found that the Nikon rated better on picture quality and color. I was not disappointed with his recommendation. This was all about getting picture of my grandson, and the pictures are wonderful. I had an older SLR, that uses 36 exposure Kodak film, that remains a good camera, but this one runs circles around that camera. It is so easy to use: point, press and shot. I don't think I had many bad shots. It even takes great shots without the flash. I've only had it for a short period of time, and I am still learning how to use it. It is clear that I can use it right now, and learn how to use it better later. It is an excellent camera, that will provide years of good experience, and wonderful pictures of my grandchildren.""
"20110806","3.0","Depends on your needs","I wanted to love this camera as a step up from my Nikon D80, but this did not fill the bill.  I will start by saying I love my Nikon D80, but I will never claim it is nearly as sharp as Canon.  My husband has a Canon xsi and T2i and my daughter has the T2i.  All 3 are stellar cameras and the sharpness would be hard to beat.  I prefer the color balance in the Nikon, and had hoped to improve the sharpness issues with this camera and the 18-200 VR lens.  Didn't happen.  So here is my opinion.PROS:*  Does great at high ISO.  Took photos at 1600 with no visible noise.*  Video feature.CONS:*  I personally found the LV button to be an annoying placement which was easy to hit inadvertently.  A button on the back would have been preferred.*  The sharpness just wasn't much of an improvement to justify the hefty price for the combo.*  I love the moveable focus box in the D80 viewfinder.  I do NOT like red focus lights.  They do not show well against some backgrounds or in high light.  I found no option to these.*  The camera uses a non-standard USB connector which means if you have multiple cameras, you will need to use separate cords for this one.Bottom line:  If you want super sharp photos, buy a Canon.  If you want to upgrade your Nikon for video and low-light situations, this may work for you.  It was not enough of an upgrade to justify the expense for me and is being returned.""
"20110805","5.0","Back to Nikon","My first 'good' camera was a Nikon N60 with various lenses. Taking multiple shots of a subject got tedious, being not able to review the pictures till they were developed. Switched to a Canon S5 IS( a wonderful camera) that took fantastic pictures for a point and shoot. Also with it being digital allowed me to easily use digital programs to fix shots, or be more artistic. Then I foolishly went to a Canon SX30IS which took lousy pictures of anything other than extreme telephoto. I quit taking pictures because of it. I decided to check out digital SLRs and found the D5100, it has impressive specs, and now I own one, it has impressive performance. It has let me fall in love with taking photos again. I didn't rate it for video, having not used that yet. I'd say it would be a good camera for a beginner digital SLR user who really wants to learn, but will still be able to make good shots using the auto functions till more is learned.""
"20110804","4.0","So far, so good.","I've been using the 5100 and love it so far. I'm still learning how to use all the features but I was able to use right out of the box. I haven't attempted any videos yet, so can't rate at this time. Thus far, I LOVE IT!!!""
"20110804","5.0","First dSLR, Loving it...","After seeing some beautiful HDR photos, I was inspired to start taking photos for myself.  I settled on the Nikon D5100 and have enjoyed the experience so far.  Never having used a dSLR, the first thing one notices is, 'Wow.  These photos are great!  You mean, I can actually take a photo in this dark room and not have it blown out with harsh camera mounted flash?!  This is awesome!' :)One of the things that I like about the D5100 that I did not think I would is the articulating LCD screen.  I didn't think I'd need it, thought it would be in the way, and thought I'd want those buttons on the left hand side of the screen more than the ability to move the screen around.  I have used this feature many, many times and have gotten some good photos because of it.  It works well to frame shots when the camera is low to the ground or in an otherwise hard area to put your eye to the viewfinder.  Also, if you're out in the bright sun, you can angle the screen so you can actually see what's on it instead of sun glare.What pushed me over the edge in getting the D5100 over the D3100 is the availability of the wireless remote.  With the D3100, you need to get the cable remote.  The wireless remote works with the D5100 from both the front and back of the camera.  There were other points; MP, fps, etc.; but the remote pushed me over the top.The camera has many features I am still learning to use and enjoy.  If this is also your first dSLR experience, I recommend reading up on photography on the web and taking a beginning photography course.  Knowing what f-stop, shutter speed, exposure value, depth of field, ISO, mean and how you use them to take great photos is the first step in taking the camera off automatic and in to manual mode.  It's not that hard, and with a fun camera like the D5100, you'll be going from snapshots to photographs in no time.""
"20110801","5.0","Awesome Camera","The image quality of this camera is amazing. I own a D90, D3100, and D5100 and I have to say this camera is the sharpest. It features the same sensor as the D7000. Even when comparing the images to my friends D700 it matches the image quality. The only thing that was hard getting used to was changing setting in manual mode. This is a lot more convenient in the D90 and D7000, that I am used to.""
"20110729","5.0","Awesome camera","I looked at all of the entry to mid-level dslrs and the D5100 best fit my needs as an 'experienced beginner'. Initially, I was a bit hesitant, because I was afraid I'd outgrow it rather quickly, so I also bought a D7000 intending to return one of them (I know, this is sometimes frowned upon, but Amazon's excellent return privileges are there for a reason).They're both great cameras and you can't go wrong with either. But I've decided to keep the D5100 for a number of reasons, including:- To my eyes, image quality is virtually indistinguishable between the 2 cameras, and I engaged in some serious pixel-peeping while reaching this conclusion. Both use the same Sony sensor. Where the D7k probably has an edge is with sports and capturing moving subjects in low light (neither of which I had the chance to shoot).- Both of the D7000's I tried had backfocusing problems due to faulty bodies. What are the odds of that?- The D7000 overexposes in bright/high contrast scenes, requiring -ev adjustment to prevent loss of detail from highlight clipping. Some may not mind this, but I think that, in its default state, the camera shouldn't overexpose to the point of losing detail, unless you're shooting in full manual mode and have chosen the wrong settings. Sometimes you don't have time to set ev comp to take advantage of a great photo op.- My trusty D5100 has had no problems whatsoever. Focus is tack sharp. Everything works and it's been an absolute pleasure to use. I also don't recall reading reports of any known problems or design flaws with the D5100, unlike the D7000.- The small form factor and light weight of the 5100 make it great for traveling. The articulating screen can also come in handy. It's well-made and the mostly-plastic build isn't a problem. Besides, the D7000 uses magnesium alloy only on the back and top (as if it was used more for show than for real ruggedness). The rest of the body shell is plastic, which is fine for most of us amateurs. If you want real ruggedness, you need to step up to a pro model.- The 5100 is often referred to as a beginner's camera, but it's actually capable of most of the things even an advanced user would need. Some of the secondary essentials (WB, release mode, bracketing) are in menus, but they're quick to access. All of the key functions, however (aperture, shutter speed, exposure comp, flash mode, AE/AF lock, ISO) are controllable via buttons (ISO can be assigned to the function button) and once you get used to the layout, it becomes second nature. There's a plethora of settings, and it *is* a camera one can grow with and hold onto for awhile. The D7000, otoh, has lots of features that I (and perhaps many other amateurs) would rarely or never use.- Being my first dslr, I didn't have any old Nikkor AFS lenses and I don't plan to buy many more lenses beyond the three that I already have. So the internal focus motor of the D7000 wasn't of any value to me. The D7000's larger, brighter, 100% coverage viewfinder is missed, but I can live without it. The D7000's glass prism adds a fair amount of weight.- Cost wasn't an issue, but I don't exactly mind saving $400 especially when I'm getting the same image quality. To me, the 5100 was a better value. The money is better spent on lenses. Furthermore, given the short life cycle of electronic products, it doesn't make sense to invest in a more expensive body with extra non-essential (to me) features, since there will be interesting developments in the next couple of years (e.g. advancement in mirrorless cam technology and lens selection), tempting me to upgrade.I'd recommend buying the D5100 body only, passing on the 18-55 kit lens in favor of the 35mm 1.8. Then add a 16-85VR and 70-300VR as budget permits. These lenses are all super sharp and should cover almost any shot that comes up. The 18-105 is a good, cheaper alternative to the 16-85.""
"20110729","5.0","Just the Kelvin color temperature is missing","I am using this camera from last 2 days and taken around 300 shots, image quality is fantastic, light sensitivity is awesome, i just noticed Kelvin color temperature is missing, it's not a big issue but lack in feature, but the auto color mode works like charm.I have bought this camera for shooting still images, but still for testing i have shot a video and that was awesome.I have not shot in scene modes till now so I m not going to review on that.By the way when I first hold this camera i fill very shortage of buttons in the left of screen, like d90 or its predecessors have and also i have to practice changing aperture in manual mode (which I use mostly) because there is no font wheel and i have to use same wheel with thumb and another figure on the +/- button on the top.But overall is worth buying, I like trying new things and this is best for me right now.I recommend this camera.""
"20110729","5.0","Excellent !","Love this camera. It's user friendly and takes terrific pictures. Haven't used the video yet  but have taken several hundred pictures with 18-55mm lens as well as zoom lens. All turn out great. The effects setting is really cool. After tons of research and almost buying a Canon T2, I found this camera does more, had better reviews and has better picture quality overall. The MP's really don't make that much difference if you don't have great lens. And this camera does. Looking for a great buy in an SLR. Buy this camera!""
"20110725","5.0","Nikon hits the bull's-eye with the D5100","For once I really researched a camera purchase. I will begin with the end: the D5100 is a superb offering that will do as much as almost all non-professional users will ever need it to do, and has more useful features than most users will ever use. There are many competing cameras at or near this price point.  I cannot claim to have researched them all, but the D5100 really does seem to be the leader.  This camera is basically a feature-laden prosumer camera -- a camera for the enthusiastic amateur who wants a camera that will do most (but not all) things that a professional camera will do, with as little fuss as possible, and in a smaller package.The most important attribute of this camera is its ability to produce superb images right out of the camera. And great images start with great exposure.  This camera can produce outstanding images that really do not require post-processing.  I have been using Nikon digital SLR cameras since the D100 was announced, through the D80 and D200.  All have been superb cameras for their days and still are.  However, most Nikon DSLRs really benefited (needed, really) a bit of post-processing in order for the images to reach their full potential.  In particular, many users have noticed that the auto-contrast settings in Nikon or third-party software programs really brightened up images, giving them better contrast and zip.  This camera pretty much does away with that.  The D-lighting feature of this camera, combined with an all-around better sensor, exposure algorithm, and exposure system, really do make it possible to produce images right out of the camera that look like they have already been post-processed on the computer.  And to make matters even better, the camera allows in-camera editing and post-processing!  So if you are on a trip and want to email a few pictures you will not need your computer; the camera will do the post-editing job for you in most cases. And in most cases this is not needed at all. Put simply, the D5100 has about achieved the ideal for digital cameras, whereby it produces a final image right out of the camera that is about perfectly exposed, with contrast and lighting the way you want it.The camera allows for matrix, center-weighted, and spot metering, just like the pro cameras.  All are useful at times. I can remember when only professional cameras had all three.  We have come a long way.The D5100 continues the Nikon trend of better and better ISO performance, as light amplification technology keeps getting better.  ISO roughly corresponds to the exposure ratings of film in days of yore, and basically better ISO performance means that the camera will perform better in low light conditions, making it possible to take clear non-noisy images in dimmer light.  My D200, which was one of the very best Nikons in its day, degrades quickly after about ISO 640.  This camera will do many multiples of this satisfactorily.  For early morning photography, or taking pictures indoors, this is a decisive, tremendous advantage.Great images also require fast and accurate focusing.  The auto-focusing system on this camera is very well thought out for its market niche.  While professional photographers will probably not use this camera to photograph NFL games and the like, this camera features an excellent focusing system that will exceed the expectations of most users.  It is an 11 point system that intelligently focuses on a subject in the foreground or tracks a moving subject or, if you wish to exercise complete control, it will allow a single point (selectable) focus which can be useful for portraits of individuals and other types of still photography.  It also has continuous focusing as an option which can be great for sports or wildlife.  While pros and certain amateur photographers may need (or at least want) the more elaborate focusing systems available on Nikon's higher end cameras, for all but the most demanding users the D5100 is more than up to the job.  Its focusing system is better than the pro systems of a few camera generations ago.  If you want to photograph your kids playing sports, this camera will do the job, and likely do it brilliantly.  This excellent focusing system, combined with its available 4 frames-per-second capability, make this camera quite capable of producing quality images of difficult fast-moving subjects.Ergonomics.  I bought this camera for two main reasons: less size and less weight.  The higher-end Nikon cameras sport metal bodies, while this unit is made out of high-impact plastic.  Given the fact that even rifles and pistols are mostly made of plastic nowadays, I consider plastic to be a virtue, not a vice.  The D5100 features excellent build quality and has every bit of that quality 'Nikon feel' that we have all come to expect.  While some pros and a few amateurs really may need a weather-sealed metal bodied camera, most of us do not.  And every single user will appreciate the very low weight of the D5100.  I carried mine all day on a family outing and for once I did not get tired of toting a camera.  I found the various buttons and controls to be easy to use and intuitive.  Some reviewers have complained about various aspects of the button placements, but honestly, I don't see it.  It is true that the camera requires a dedicated ISO button, because its wider ISO capability probably means that users will be varying this setting a lot.  Fortunately, the D5100 has a user-assignable Function button.  I simply assigned ISO as the function, so my D5100 has a dedicated ISO button.  I do find myself using it often, as I vary it to high ISO for indoor shots, to low ISO for bright sunny summer days.The color LCD screen on the D5100 opens to the side, and can be rotated 180 degrees.  Some reviewers have complained that: a) this means that one cannot put a plastic cover on the LCD to protect it; and b) the swivel arm on the LCD screen may be a mechanical weak link.  There may be a little truth to this, but consider.  Since the LCD screen folds against the back of the camera, if folded in screen first it is protected during field use, and yet easily accessible by swinging it out if you need to access it for some reason.  During field use (hiking, etc.) I rarely need to use the screen, and since it is folded against the camera, it is very well protected.  As far as the strength of the swivel arm, well, time will tell.  I trust that Nikon knew what it was doing when it designed this component.  Hope so.The LCD screen does multiple duty.  It performs the function that the mono LCD screens used to do on other Nikons, i.e. showing exposure mode, picture count, etc. (Many of these things are also displayed in the viewfinder.)  It also displays the menu system.  And of course you may view and edit the photographs with the LCD.  And the LCD also presents live-view, meaning that you get an instant through-the-lens electronic display of the viewfinder; a feature that until a few years ago only point-and-shoot cameras afforded.  I was initially skeptical of this feature, but I do find myself using it at times.  The viewfinder is bright and crisp, with a pleasing display.The menus are mostly intuitive.  I say mostly, because at first I had trouble locating some of the key functions that I wanted.  Specifically, the 'sharpening' control, which is a critical setting, is buried three layers deep in the menus.  Other Nikons place this setting more obviously.  This quirk is the exception, and once I understood the logic of the menu setup, I have had no further problems.  Most users will adapt quickly to the menu system in this camera.The optical viewfinder features a 95% view of the actual lens picture.  Very few users will miss that 5%.The camera allows full shutter, aperture, and programmed mode just like the pro cameras.  The camera has other features including 'effects,' and HDR (high dynamic range) shooting, which combines two shots of an image using different exposures.  While many users will never use these features, some will.  The HDR feature has real potential for those willing to experiment and put in the time to master it.To keep cost and weight down, the D5100 does not contain an inboard focusing motor.  This means that some of the older Nikon lenses do not have autofocus if used with the D5100 since some of these lenses do not have internal focusing motors.  This will mainly affect long-time photographers who have some of the older Nikon lenses in the bag.  Most newer users will never miss it.  Me, I do regret that a couple of my old stand-bys will not autofocus with this camera.  But most of them will, so there you are.  I bought the D5100 bundled with the AFS 18-55 3.5-5.6 VRII kit lens.  This is a very nice 'walking around' lens that will do nicely for many applications.  For sports and wildlife most users will want a lens with longer reach.  But for many applications, i.e. vacations, portraits, etc., the kit lens will do very nicely.  It is equipped with Nikon's superb VRII stabilization system, which really makes this lens shine for still subjects in low light.  Given the D5100's excellent ISO performance, enhancing its low-light capability, this lens can really shine.I rarely shoot movies, but for those who do, this camera is a very serviceable HD videocamera.  Other reviews have no doubt covered this feature adequately.Overall Conclusion.  As the reader can tell, I am very enamored with the D5100.  At the end of the day it is the images that matter, and the D5100 produces professional-grade images.  On trips and other occasions I am often found carrying around a camera, and the light weight and small size of the d5100 make it a joy to use.  More and more I find myself reaching for the D5100 instead of my bigger, near pro-grade cameras.  In fact, the more I use the D5100 the more convinced I am that it is pretty close to being pro-grade itself.  Its size, weight, and capabilities, combined with its price, make the D5100 an excellent choice for many users.  Highly recommended.  RJB.""
"20110725","4.0","New to Photography","I was looking for a quality DSLR for the price that could tackle my video needs while at the same time have the addition of my newfound photography.  It was after much research I found the Nikon 5100.  So far I've had for about 3 weeks and I couldn't be happier.  It's low light capability and ease of use has helped me tackle some great shots including my first ever try at concert photography.  [...].  The Video capture is very crisp as well.  I haven't used in full yet, but for test shooting it's been amazing.  The detail captured in full HD is perfect for what I needed it to do.  I have the additional 18-200mm lens and both have been everything I was looking for price and in a camera.  Plus having the sensor of the D7000 for $400 less, you can't argue that value.  Also, additionally I edited the photos using Aperture 3 on a Macbook Pro.""
"20110724","5.0","Just keeps on working great","This camera has been very realiable.  I work in a rural area and on the way back from lunch I was able to snap a couple quick shots of ducks in the ditches that turned out really great (even on a lower image quality) after only having the camera for a few hours. From a beginner's stand point this couldn't be easier to use. I highly reccomend this camera if you want to take your photography to a serious level. I just got this today. I did do my homework before purchasing the item, and have also purchased an additional  lens to go with it which also came today. Right out of the box the camera was great. The ease of going through the menus and changing settings is great. There are also images inside the menues so you have an idea of what those settings are used for and will do when you change them.""
"20110720","5.0","Another home run from Nikon","The last thing I needed was another Nikon DSLR but when I saw the specs and the giveaway price I persuaded myself it was just a back-up\ body I was buying to supplement my clutch of pro-bodies, a somewhat ancient D2x and a D2h, that have been weighing me down for the past 5 years or so. Out of the box, and with the almost fully charged battery inserted, I could not believehow little it weighed, and how small it was compared to my old clunkers. I think if you had particularly large hands you may find it a little too small, but I found the fit quite perfect. I tried my everyday Nikkor 17-55mm on the body and it felt very unbalanced with this heavy metalled lens attached. I then put on a Series 1 18-200mm VR Nikkor and it felt much better. In fact I have not removed it over several weeks of solid use, now over 9,000 shutter actuations! And being a Nikon, it hasn't missed a beat -yet!I shoot mainly weddings and other event stuff as well as all the usual friends and family pics that we all do. From the start I found the resolution and image quality quite outstanding particularly when I needed to crank it up to ISO3200 for some shots near dusk.I have to say it just blows away the results I used to get from the D2x in those same or similar lighting conditions. The new generation 16MP sensor is now a generation or two ahead of the 12.2MP sensor aboard the D2x, and boy doesn't it show?For a camera aimed squarely at the lower end of the 'enthusiast' sector this offering from Nikon has made me wonder if professional photographers will continue to cough up for the D300s, the D700 and the base model D3. OK the latter two are full frame not DX and I can see the need for these expensive models in certain applications but heck, I can buy 2 D5100 bodies forthe price of a D300s and win on almost every count that I consider is of importance to my work. Higher resolution, better image quality video autofocus and continuous video focus, lower noise at high ISO, Built-in HDR, a lot more dynamic range, significantly better colour depth, flip-out screen, 6400 ISO and better boost to  25,600.  It's smaller , lighter and half the price.  OK no built in motor for non AF-S lenses, and the 300s scores on speed, battery life and a few other areas over the D5100, which even scoresheavily in an out of league comparison with the mighty D3s!It is well made from high quality plastic, which would probably put off many enthusiasts and pro-users - but I have already put it through the high impact drop test - inadvertently, of course! I dropped it and the 18-200mm zoom on a stone floor from about 1.5meters. The only damage was a broken card door which I can replace for under a fiver in the US. No other damage apart from a slight dent in the lens hood.I haven't shot much video yet but what I have seen so far is of the highest  quality imaginable when run at 1080 and 30fps - quite stunning footage I must say. I suppose I miss the easy screen and button based logic of the D2x and there is a certain clumsiness involved with the menu embedded functionality of the D5100 - but when in doubt , or short of time just head for the Auto setting or any one of the prescribed modes on the dial to suit your needs.As you may have guessed, the D5100 is not my back-up at all. I use it all the time now with the D2x just sitting in my bag. Problem is it is so heavy to lug around so I think I will sell it on Ebay, for about the same price as a new D5100 - and send off to Amazon for another one of these little gems!""
"20110720","5.0","So much better than the D5000!","I'm a loyal Nikon DSLR user, owning the D50, 560, D5000, and now D5100.  I love my Nikon DSLRs, but the D5000 was the only camera I found seriously flawed, both in design and quality.  The D5100 has completely remedied all those problems for me and the D5100 now ranks as my favorite yet!D5000 Problems?1.) The Swivel-out display was unusable because it was hinged at the bottom of the camera instead of the side, which means it's ideal only for over the head shots and could not be used with a tripod mount.  The D5100 gives us a much more usable side-mounted swivel display which can be used with a tripod and can be articulated in many more useful angles (front view, side view, down view, up view, etc.).2.) Because of its position, the Live-View button could easily be triggered when placing the camera to your face.  This has been solved with a MUCH better switch mechanism near the mode-dial, along with a dedicated record button.3.) Live-View auto focusing was extremely slow and often inaccurate, the D5100 has made huge improvements in this area.4.) The D5000 also lacked auto focusing during movie recording, although the D5100 still requires the user to hold down the shutter button to activate AF.5.)  The microphone has been improved dramatically with far more user controls6.) Hot pixels are gone!  The D5000 had notorious hot pixel issues which I've never seen on my previous DSLRs, I had to send my camera back three times...and the problem persisted and got worse every month, Nikon cameras don't have software to automatically map these pixels out so it has to go back to the manufacturer (this almost forced me over to Canon).  Fortunately, the D5100 is flawless!7.)  The D5100 camera body has a flat bottom which is flush with most Nikkor lenses, the D5000 was taller because of the position of the hinged screen, which meant the camera couldn't be used on flat surfaces to take photos (as I like to do when I'm not carrying my tripod).8.)  Probably one of the most critical improvements has been in the resolution of the display, jumping from 230K to 920k.9.)  The diopter now has an easier to use knob instead of a fidgety slider control.10.) Video recording now available in 1080p at 30fps, and without the horrendous rolling 'Jelly' effectAnd overall, the camera offers much better low-light performance with a much faster and quieter shutter release.  It's also much smaller, lighter and feels much more comfortable to hold because of it's nicer hand grip materials.Needs Improvement.  Like all DSLRs, this is still a terrible handheld video camera.  It takes great video, but the autofocus is still slow and noisy and the microphone is relatively poor.  You are still better off putting this camera on a tripod and controlling the focus yourself for professional results, and using an external mic or recording your own audio.  Thankfully the high res display makes accurate manual focusing much easier.Overall, I feel this is one of Nikon's most polished cameras.""
"20110718","4.0","Nice DSLR among several choices","I have Nikon DSLR cameras and lens, so I was looking at the possible upgrades in my price range.  My choices were the D7000, D90, and this D5100.  After considering the pros and cons of each of these three choices, I picked the D5100.  I have had the camera only a few weeks, but I still think it was the best choice for me.  It has the resolution, low noise that I wanted and I have found that for every day shooting, I don't like to carry heavy camera gear around much anymore, so I really like the size and weight of this camera.  Also, as my eyes are not as good as they used to be, I like having the settings show up on that big LCD display on the back, instead of the smaller screen on top of the other two cameras listed above.  I think for the price and features this camera gives, there are only a few trade offs that I miss and can certainly live without.  All in all, a very good camera....""
"20110717","5.0","Great SLR at an affordable price","I was looking for a SLR which was not very bulky and had all the features for taking great photos. The 5100 fitted the requirement and i am happy that i bought it.Its taking great pictures, specially the low light ones at high ISO come out quite well. The HD video is also a good thing to have though the mic picks up the auto focus sound which is quite irritating. I guess an external mic would sort that. The supplied battery lasts sufficiently long.One problem that i have faced is that the memory card cover opens up quite easily. More setting buttons would have helped.""
"20110715","5.0","Great First SLR","My fiancee bought me this camera for my birthday this year (totally awesome surprise for me).  I've been thinking about getting an SLR for a while, but never took the plunge (due to not fear of spending too much on lenses/accessories).So far I've yet to purchase any additional lenses, so have been shooting with the 18/55mm kit lens so far (will hopefully be getting the 35mm f1.8 in the near future).  While I'm only shooting at max aperture f3.5, the pictures so far have turned out great, especially in low lighting.  The beginner friendly interface on the UI to help you find the right ISO/aperture/shutter speed has helped me immensely in getting nice pictures.After owning the camera for less than 2 weeks, I'm able to pretty quickly set the ISO/aperture/shutter on the camera (custom button set to ISO).  It would definitely be nice if there was a second dial, but I've found it overall pretty easy to get used to.  Looking forward to getting my first prime lens (and being able to actually get some decent bokeh in some shots).""
"20110713","4.0","Nikon D5100 vs Canon T3i","As a Nikon owner for years, I recently had a chance to evaluate both Nikon D5100 and Canon T3i, here is my list of the differences between these two entry level flagships from the two big players:1. T3i has 4 buttons on the back defined to be used to control 'AF', 'White Balance', 'Drive Mode', and 'Picture Control', plus a dedicated ISO button on the shoulder, and a focus point selector on the top right corner of the back, which is great. For D5100, you have to go deep into the menu. This first one is very important to many experienced photographers.2. T3i can trigger external flash, D5100 can't.3. T3i has White Balance Shifts with the Custom White Balance, Nikon D5100 Customer White Balance is a one shot setup.4. T3i's image quality seems to be a little better than D5100. Especially the LCD is brighter and looks great.5. T3i can work with any Canon lens, D5100 only works with AF-S lenses due to the lack of a body motor.6. T3i's White Balance Bracketing is both ways. D5100 is only for Amber and Blue.7. D5100 has Distortion Control, before and after shoot, T3i doesn't.8. D5100 has Color Balance adjustment after shot, T3i doesn't.9. D5100 has Straighten feature, T3i doesn't.10. D5100 has Perspective adjustment, T3i doesn't.11. D5100 makes smarter decision when shoot in P, A, S modes, while T3i frequently make you shoot in a wired combination like '1/320, ISO3200, f22'...12. D5100's battery lasts much longer, almost 50% longer. T3i's battery is small and looks cheap.13. D5100 has HDR feature which sometimes maybe useful.14. D5100's power switch is located in a perfect position. T3i's is a little awkward.Common issues:1. When in bright sunlight, both tend to produce yellowish images, that's more like a common issue of CMOS sensor. I have never had a problem with CCD cameras, but I have experienced the same issue with all the CMOS cameras including Nikon D7000, Nikon D90, Nikon D300s.2. Live Mode focuses very slow on both (Nikon is slightly better).Both cameras are great, it all depends on your preference.""

"20110710","5.0","Best decision I ever made!","What led me to this awesome camera:-----------------------------------------------  2 years back I started out as someone who simply wanted to take pictures. I didn't care about the quality that much, though I did want a decent amount of megapixels and video capability. So I bought myself a Samsung SL620 point-and-shoot with 12 megapixels and SD video capability. That camera died on me 6 months later. Christmas that year, I got a new Samsung SL820, which was like the 1st only with 720p video capability. That one also quit on me, but this time after 2 months. May 2010, I got the same camera and it only lasted 3 months, but I've taken over 1,000 pics with it. By then, I was starting to get an interest in photography and taking quality shots. Last fall, I borrowed my dad's Sony F717, which was a 5 megapixel bridge camera that he's now had for 8 years. I figured out that camera in just a few days. Unlike my cameras, the Sony had manual settings and manual focus. I was impressed by the blurred backgrounds, the color not so much. I had to fix the washed out colors in Photoshop. A couple weeks after Christmas, I had made enough money to get another point-and-shoot (Bad choice). This one was a Samsung TL240, which had 14 megapixels and a touchscreen. I got some decent shots with it, but they could've been better. A couple months later, one of my friends at school accidently knocked that camera off a table and the lens got stuck. After that, I decided I was gonna save up the extra cash and get an SLR so I could get better quality shots. I looked at several different cameras on this website. Some bridge and some SLRs. I wanted one that took decent HD video (with a reasonable amount of recording time per video), had a decent resolution, and had decent low-light. By the 1st week of April, I was gonna stick with a Samsung NX10, then I saw the Nikon D5100 on Amazon, although it wasn't actually available yet. It had everything I wanted and more.Review:---------------------------------------------Photos:This camera takes very awesome pictures and I rarely need to use the flash. This camera stomps my deceased cameras and my dad's Sony into the ground. The focusing is very fast, except in live view. The articulating display is very helpful when I want to take self-portraits. I bought a remote so I could take self-portraits that were focused right. It totally beats the self-timer. The HDR feature is awesome, although it's only meant for still scenes and not action or anything with movement. I've used the 30-second shutter speed for shots after sunset and they come out quite nice. I only wish there were some longer shutter speeds. Holding down the shutter for a minute or 2 can be very annoying when using the bulb feature because I usually get some motion blur, even when I'm using a tripod. The effects are pretty awesome too. I used the sketch feature to sketch a picture of an Ingles store and I put it on Facebook saying that I drew it myself. My parents are in love with that feature. I can honestly say I haven't had any softness issues with my pictures, after I turned the sharpening up a notch. I also haven't had any problems with the reds being exaggerated. The colors are just great and this is the first camera I've had that took pictures that I didn't need to enhance in Photoshop before I upload them to Facebook.Video:The HD video on this camera is very clear, unlike the 'HD' video on my older cameras. I bought the expensive external microphone and the sound is great and you don't hear as much of the autofocus noise. The video is a little bit wobbly when I move the camera kinda fast, but I'm pretty sure the older Nikon D5000 is much worse. Video is not my goal in life (If it were, I would've gotten a camcorder). I shoot random videos every now and then. I also have a show on Youtube that I do every once in a while.Camera in general:This camera is awesome. It may not be perfect, but no camera is or ever will be unless God makes one himself. I have absolutely no desire to return or trash this camera. It was money well-spent. Unlike the Nikon D40 (which I had borrowed from my photography teacher one time), it doesn't feel so awkward trying to get a self-portrait with just one hand. I plan on using this camera in college this fall and for a long time. Eventually, when I get rich, I'll step up to a full-frame camera. I'm not in any rush to do that though. Right now, I'm just using the kit lens included with this camera and the pictures are pretty good. I plan on getting more lens, such as the 18-200mm (for video), the 55-300mm lens, and a portrait lens.(Edit: I just realized that I can use my remote for the bulb feature.)----------------------------------------------------------------------12/7/2011 Update:I've had this camera for 6 months now and it stopped working. Just kidding. This awesome camera is still working as great as it did when I first got it out of its package on June 7th. I've dropped it a few times, being the clumsy person I am, but it didn't affect the camera. However, I had to replace my kit lens in October after accidentally hitting it on a door and later making things worse when I took it off and put it back on the wrong way. I decided to spend the extra money and get the 18-105mm lens instead of the standard 18-55mm lens I am using my camera right now in my photography classes in college. I started shooting in RAW on a regular basis in September and I gotta say, if you want to get the best out of your images, shoot in RAW. I use Lightroom and the images are much sharper than than JPGs straight from the camera. I tried Capture NX, but for some reason, the RAW images turn out like the in-camera JPGs and aren't very sharp. Just thought I'd let you all know.""
"20110709","5.0","Love it!","Maybe the only drawback (and it's a personal one) is the rear view.  I liked the fixed LCD screen on the rear of my previous camera (D40).  Think the the pull out is kinda awkward to use...but then again, I'm not a Live-View kinda guy...like to see my shots through the viewfinder.""
"20110708","3.0","Nice but for whom?","In terms of sensor and picture quality, I have nothing to complain. An excellent camera from that point of view. As people have spoken enough about the good side, I would like to mention some thing that I do not like.Following the market trend, the D5100 is trying to load a lot of things into the camera. The manufacturer is focusing too much on marketing strategies and forgot that simplicity is also important and welcome. A classic example: the aperture priority and speed priority. These are actually the same thing, and one of them is redundant. But now even more unnecessary options are packed into a small machine and only few of them are truly needed. The pixel size racing is also becoming ridiculous. For that type of camera, 10MP is good enough. More is not positive anymore. If people do want to make huge prints, they should go with full-frame or medium format cameras. Many of the in-camera photo treatment options are also unnecessary or even childish. Serious photo editing should be taken care of by computer software as the small camera screen will make the job rough anyway. I wish more efforts are made for dynamic range improvement (D5100 did well in this aspect) and cost reduction (this can be improved). It does not make much sense to spend $900 (current street price) for something plastic that will become obsolete in 2 to 3 years.The D5100 is supposed to be a premier entry level camera. 'Premier entry level' is actually a bad idea (it is almost an oxymoron in reality). For those who do not know how to take good pictures, the extra cost will not help them improve picture quality much, as they may not even fully utilize the capacity of the lower entry level cameras while they are less expensive. For those who are serious about photography, a lot of features are either trivial (e.g., scene selection, live view, in-camera editing, etc.), or not good enough (e.g., movie). If they are serious, even if they are not good now, they will be determined to learn how to manipulate exposures instead of relying on things like scene selections. For some people, the D5100 offers high ISO for dark objects, but it will be wiser to spend the extra money on a good lens, e.g., the 50mm/f1.8D, 50mm/f1.8G, or 35mm/f1.8G. These fast lens will help in low lighting situations and produce better pictures, and they will not become obsolete in 20 years. In addition, filters also help in many ways to expand the capabilities of the camera. In my opinion, the D5100 should be modified in one of the following two directions:1. For those who are serious about photography and do not have the budget for D7000, the D5100 could offer them a less expensive model with same sensor quality but even lower price (by minimizing the unimportant features), or the current price but more functions/features for professionals instead of those for populace.2. For those who do not intend to learn photography, the D3100 is good enough as it also has the live view, video option, and improved high ISO. They do not need the D5100 (except they have no other place to spend the additional $200). If they do need an upgrade, then auto HDR and high resolution screen in D5100 can be good additions, but these should be enough. The price difference could be within $50-100, not $200 (by dropping other 'improvements').Here comes a question of how to segment customers. The current popular categories of 'beginners' and 'enthusiasts' are misleading. A more useful segmentation should be enthusiasts or not, i.e., those who want to learn photography and those who do not, and all the features and functions should be designed and packaged in these two directions. But today, things are mixed in one direction (for entry level cameras), the distinctions are mostly a matter of degrees, i.e., more or less features, not different types of features.By the way, I also would like to talk about the appearance design. The D5100 is elegant, but not as good as D40 and D3000 (in appearance). Nikon made one of the D5100 body's corners round (lower-right side viewing from front). That part does not match the the overall sleek looking. The childish treatment makes that part look silly and the entire body fatty. Another design issue: Viewing from the right side, the gap between the display panel and the camera body is unnecessarily too wide. I think a tight fit will make it look more robust and elegant. Forgive me for being fastidious, but appearance is as important to me as functions and quality. And appearance promotes sale (think about Apple's gracious designs).Overall, the D5100 is a good camera, but it is not the best in combination of features and price: both enthusiast and non-enthusiasts will pay for many features they do not need, in different ways. The problem is camera manufacturers are trying to blend different needs instead of separating them in the entry level DSLR section.""
"20110708","5.0","Another great product from NIKON","The NIKON D5100 packed with many features and a great value for price. It is very user friendly and anyone with little photography knowledge can use this camera efficiently. The rotating LCD monitor would be a great advantage for capturing in different angles, which is not possible with other DSLR cameras.I really got amazed with the output from this camera and would definitely recommend this to everyone.""
"20110707","5.0","Very hard to find any fault with the D5100","I was just like you reading every single review out on the internet on this camera.  Everyone seems to agree that this is probably the best APS-C sized sensor out there right now (shared with the more expensive D7000). After taking many shots with it myself during both daylight and low-light scenarios I have to say I am in love with this camera.  Initially, I did want the extra controls & perceived build quality & built-in AF of the D90/D7000, but the articulating screen and the awesome photos coming out of the D5100 are just beautiful (btw, Lightroom is useful no matter which DLSR you choose to buy).  Once you get used to the controls, getting to the functions you use most often is cake.  At the end of the day you cannot go wrong with the D5100 or its main competitor (the Canon T3i), it is really more up to the photographer (and then the lenses) to frame and have an eye for the right photo.  Although the D5100 seems to kick the T3i's ass when it comes down to low-light high ISO shooting.Pros:+Best APS-C sensor out right now (same as more expensive D7000, DXOMark scores to prove it technically)+Articulating hi-resolution screen+Relatively small & light for a DSLR; very comfortableCons:-Fewer manual controls compared to D90/D7000 tier (not missing as much as just buried under menu)-Build materials a little lower than D90/D7000 tier (also costs less)-No built in AF-motor (this is a biggie since 3rd party lens manufacturers are not rushing to bring in AF motors - example being the Tokina 11-16mm would be manual focus lens with the D5100)""

Fortunately, amazon.com allowed us an upgrade to D5100 for the price difference of ~$250. It was well worth it. The D5100 has a far superior screen with much higher resolution for a live view recording. It definitely takes much better low light photos. The photos with the 55-300 zoom lens that we also purchased from amazon.com are superlative. The only minus is that D5100 is not as user friendly as the D3100. D3100 has a Guide Mode that even our kids could use to take good photos and videos; the D5100 does not. But D5100 does offer more creative photo processing features compared to the D3100.""

"20110630","4.0","Enjoying the new functionality of DSLR","I am new to DSLR cameras but decided to try the d5100 instead of the D3100, and I'm glad I did. The 3100 was in the price range that I was looking to spend but in using the camera and some of the functionality I found that it was mostly comparable but when it came down to usability and features I decided that I would grow into the 5100 sooner than later and why not move one step up instead of wishing I had 6 months into it.  But realizing that I did not want to move into the d7100 because the price jump was just too much for me.  Features were great and the only thing that was bad for me is that I ordered mine and the price dropped promptly the following weekend.Got the 50 - 200mm lens along with the standard 18-55.  Finding myself using the zoom more often but found myself buying a prime 35mm lens for portrait type photos and indoor party scenes.  Found that it responds a little better and although I am still learning how to use it I find that this lens is becoming my favorite.  I probably would purchase a body only and only the lenses that I wanted if I had it to do over and probably will when I am ready to upgrade.Having fun learning to use this over my old point and shoot and will be doing some traveling this year and will update this review with some more real-world usage.""
"20110630","5.0","Great beginner's DSLR that I can really grow into","I am definitely an enthusiastic amateur, not a professional photographer by any means. I got the D5100 as an upgrade from my 5 MP point-and-shoot!I must have read every review and every written word about this camera and the D3100 before buying, and a lot of it was over my head. Here's why I chose the D5100 and love it!It's easy to use. As I said, I upgraded from a point-and-shoot. The D5100 has pretty decent 'Auto' settings, so I was able to take it out of the box and begin shooting. AMAZING! The speed and quality are incredible! Especially compared to my point-and-shoot! As I'm learning, I'm using more of the customize-able settings, but I really appreciated being able to take the camera out and begin shooting photos immediately. Isn't that what photography is all about?Great built-in flash. I bought (and always use) the SB-400, but before it came in, I was using the built-in flash, and I am impressed. Huge leaps above my point-and-shoot, in terms of light output, color, and lack of red-eye!Amazing in low light. My point-and-shoot wasn't. Low light and night photos may be one of my favorite things from this camera.Articulating screen. I really don't use live view all that often, but as a vacation, family, and pet photographer, the articulating screen has come in handy. I could live without it, but I'm very happy I have it.Ability to use ML-L3 wireless remote. Sounds silly, but this is a feature that sold me on the D5100 over the D3100. Makes family group photos a breeze!Great LCD. To be fair, I haven't actually seen the LCD screen on the D3100 but I had read that it wasn't all it could have been. The screen on the D5100 is fantastic. Of course nothing beats seeing your photos on a nice big computer monitor or printed out, but the LCD is a great tool for previewing photos as you go, and for me, learning as I go! I can critique myself immediately.Filters. People with DSLRs already may not be enthused by this, but as a first time DSLR owner, I'm excited about the different filters that are available to me. My wishlist is growing!So far, the menus and everything have been easy to use, but currently, I am just continually snapping away, and I can get to the technical mumbo jumbo later. I feel like this is a great camera for beginners, but has all the advanced features and quality that I can really grow into and learn to use as I hone my photography skills. Framing and composing pictures in a DSLR is such a different experience than in a point-and-shoot, and the depth of field is amazing. I can't say enough good things about this camera. I was worried it would be too heavy to really carry around (I am never without my pocket point-and-shoot) but that isn't the case, and for the amazing photos I'm getting, I'm willing to carry it with me anywhere!(Also, for other first time DSLR owners, I did upgrade my little 2gb SD card to a 16 gb class 10 card (as recommended by Nikon)).All-in-all an amazing camera purchase and I could not be happier!""
"20110629","5.0","Best thing I got for myself","This is the best camera I have used. Last year I had purchased and used Nikon D5000. But this year I decided to buy this D5100. This is just great. Picture quality is just excellent. No words to express it. I took it for my hiking trip to Mount Washington. The pictures came so so good..It is Just as if i didn't see the views so clear in my own eyes.. Unbelievable ..Only thing which I don't like to changing the lenses frequently.. But that's the way it is..I have to deal with that..Otherwise pay some fat bucks for a better lense..""
"20110629","4.0","Probably the best mid-level (sub-$1000) camera on the market.","I spent months researching my next camera (from a K20d) and settled on this one for it's killer image sensor, and well-rounded feature set. It does video competently (30 FPS at 1080p, in the H.264 codec) and does everything you'd expect from an SLR (multi-exp bracketting, A-S-P-M-AUTO modes, 14-bit RAW, etc). The image sensor is the absolute best in a consumer SLR, which trumps any offering from Canon (even the 7D, just check out the numerical quality benchmarks by DxOMark). It'll produce clean images in conditions few cameras can match (assuming equal optics) and Nikon's VR system is damn good. Articulating screen is a nice touch, but more importantly it's 900k+ pixels, so you have a crisp preview of shots you take.Only downside is that Canon has a few tricks like 60 FPS HD video, and occasionally superior optics. Nikon could also have designed the D5100 for bigger hands. But cosmetic issues aside, it is the very definition of a solid, well-rounded camera. (This will be my third SLR.)*Purchased kit with a 55-300 AF-S VR G lens. Highly recommend it over the 55-200, if you can get a rebate on it.*""
"20110626","5.0","Good Features","Nikon did themselves proud with this new design. The features packed in it, make it one of the best cameras for the money. It's a matter of preference between it and the new Cannon. The images are crisp and full of detail and the color is balanced and true. The HD video sets the standard that others will have to quickly hustle to match. My only wish is that it had a full frame sensor rather than the DX format, but for my use, I will probably never see the difference. I am totally stoked with this camera. It also fits the hand well.""
"20110624","5.0","Fantastic Picture Quality; Great High ISO performance","I sold my D3100 and purchased the D5100.  I really liked my D3100, but there are 2 features I wanted that the D5100 has:  1.) bracketing function and 2.) ISO 1/3 increments.  I like HDR photography, and the 3 exposure bracketing mode makes it easier to do on the D5100 (although I wish it had a 5 exposure bracketing mode).  I take a lot of night photos, and the D3100 would only go from 800 to 1600 to 3200.  The D5100 will let you shoot at ISO 1000, 1250, 2000, etc.  The high ISO performance on the D3100 is very good, but it is outstanding/phenomenal on the D5100.  I have taken quite a few ISO 5000 and 6400 photos on the D5100 that come out awesome with almost no noise, even with the stock lens.  I recently took a photo at ISO 5000 and posted on flickr that looks like ISO 200 on almost any other camera I have ever used, including my Panasonic GH1.  I will share it on Amazon.  I believe the incredible low light, high ISO performance is because the D5100 shares the same sensor as the D7000.  So this is a big upgrade from the D3100 as far as the sensor in low light environments.  I have taken about 500 photos so far, and pictures come out tack sharp with the stock lens.  Combined with the 35 mm F1.8 Nikon lens, the camera takes as fantastic of pictures as I could possibly imagine.  Battery life is incredible--after 500 pics the battery indicator still showed the full 3 bars.  I also like the adjustable swivel screen for when I am shooting on a tripod or above my head.  The one thing I do not like about the camera are the placement of the buttons and settings.  There is not a button for ISO; you have to press the 'i' button then scroll down on the screen and change it.  You could assign ISO to the Fn button (which is in a difficult location on the left side of the camera), but then you can't set the camera to a 2 second self-timer without going through the menu.  I use the 2 second timer a lot for shooting on a tripod at night, so I didn't change the Fn button.  On the D3100, the self timer was on a switch on the top; not sure why they removed that.  Overall the controls are somewhat cumbersome in the dark without looking at the camera.  I am getting used to them, but they could make it easier.  Finally, the D5100 does not autofocus on older Nikon lenses like the D7000 does.  But I think the picture quality of the D5100 is probably equal to the D7000 because they use the same sensor.  Other than the controls/button placement issue, I love this camera and highly recommend it.  I think it is certainly worth the 200 dollars more than the D3100 if you are considering between the 2.""

I posted some of the pictures I took on a cruise forum and many people have posted positive comments regarding the pictures.  I've only had the camera for a short period of time (I have not even had the chance to do any serious editing of the photographs yet), but I am happy with the camera.""
"20110622","4.0","Great Camera - buried features","I bought this camera from a different retailer with an extra AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor 55-200mm f/4-5.6G IF-ED lens because I wanted to have it in my hands instantly.First off, let me say that I love this thing!  I don't think i've left the house without is since I bought it a week and a half ago.  This was really my first foray into serious photography.  I skipped right over the point and shoot stage and got one of these.  I consulted a friend of mine who teaches art and photography courses at the university where I work and eventually landed on the 5100.  I looked hard at the D7000, but didn't want to forfeit the extra coin.  Now I kind of wish that I had.As I said before, I love the camera, BUT...As my friend told me, there are lots of functions buried in menus rather than being available directly on the camera body.  I didn't think it would bother me since this was really my first d-slr. I am a quick learner though and i'm now shooting in manual mode pretty confidently.  That being said there are some things that I wish weren't in menus such as ISO, focus mode, metering, shutter release mode, picture control, bracketing, etc...  There are a few features like ISO and shutter release mode that can be mapped to the self timer button (one or the other) but then you lose the functionality of the immediate access to the self timer.  The fact that shutter speed and aperture are controlled with the same command dial (shutter by turning the command dial alone and aperture by holding the exposure compensation/aperture button and then turning the command dial) isn't too much of a burden, but when you have to hold 2 buttons AND turn the command dial to adjust flash compensation it gets a bit tedious.I would have liked to have the 2 SD card slots that the 7000 has to store raw and jpg on separate cards, but oh well - not that big of a deal.  Although the camera is made of some sort of plastic composite material (what isn't these days?), it feels substantial and well-made in your hands.All in all, you will not be disappointed with this camera.  It takes amazing images and the effects mode will have some nice surprises for you.  You can do some basic editing directly on the camera as well.  Live view is very nice with the variable angle display but you can't see the light/ISO meter on it.  the body of the camera is compact and light so you don't feel like you have a  laptop hanging from your neck.  I've found the battery life to be marvelous when you don't use the flash or live view extensively.  I was glad that spare/replacement batteries aren't too expensive for this baby either.There is a learning curve to using the menus, but they are surprisingly more intuitive than I expected.  If you can read and make use of the help button, you will be able to figure out a lot without even looking at the manual!  I do recommend reading the manual that lives on the CD that comes with your camera.  I have copied that to my hard drive and my smart phone for quick reference.  It goes into much more detail than the paper manual that comes with the camera.If this is your first experience with a d-slr, you aren't a stickler about having functions istantly available or you need a very good, lightweight backup d-slr because you don't want to carry your full-bodied model, stop searching through reviews and get yourself one of these!  You WILL NOT be disappointed.Once you take the plunge, there's no looking back though!  You will be scouring the internet for deals on lenses, filters and everything d-slr related!  As my friend told me, it's like an infection or being in a cult - but not in a bad way; whatever that means!  ;)I'm in love with this camera, but when she get's old i'm going after her big sister, who has more functions on her body!!Have fun with your new D5100!""
"20110618","5.0","Awesome DSLR","I've been on the hobby for about 5 year now, my last camera was a Nikon D60 and let me tell you, this D5100 completely obliterates the D60, it even outperforms the D90 as this camera has the same excellent sensor as the High end Nikon D7000, just in a smaller package, sadly it does not have an integrated autofocus motor in the body so AF it only works on newer AF-S lenses, but that is not a problem anymore because we have a big variety of AF-S lenses.Image quality is superb, specially on low light conditions, we can crank up the ISO Speed and it looks great, even at ISO 6400. Video quality is just as great but my true passion is photography so I can't get deep into reviewing the video recording feature.If you want the BEST DSLR for under 1000 Dollars this is the one to get.""
"20110618","4.0","Can't beat it in the compact slr niche","Size and weight is very important to me, so I upgraded to the D5100 from my D60. I've got small hands, so I have no difficulty using a small SLR.As far as being a camera goes, it shoots as fast as I need at 4 fps and the image quality is excellent, especially at higher ISO with prime lenses. Nikon seems to be committed to DX for the long term so the lack of an internal focus motor does not concern me. I recommend the DX AF-S 35mm 1:1.8G lens at fairly low cost to achieve excellent indoor and lower light results.As far as being a video camera goes, if you want to record quality videos I'd recommend you purchase a quality video camera.The flip out screen is an somewhat aggravating gadget to me, but if you are hell bent on using the camera for video I'd say it makes sense in that regard.With respect to the kit 18-55 lens, it's light weight and for a hundred bucks brand new just can't be beat. I'd recommend owning one even if you are going to own/use a variety of lenses. To me it's a good value general all purpose lens for the money.I can't comment on the environmental sealing of the camera and cold weather operation as I havn't used it in less that ideal condtions yet. I live in a very cold wilderness environment and will be carefully using the camera in temperatures far below zero. I never had a problem in three years of using the D60, so I'm banking on the same cold weather performance from the D5100.""

"20110613","5.0","What a camera.... and what a steal!","I bought my D5100 just 4 weeks ago and 2000 shots later have to report that this is one of the very best and certainly the very cheapest Nikon (D)SLR's I ever owned in more than 50 years. Not being as dextrous as I once was I wanted something that gave me pin sharp pics out of the box without having to fuss through lengthy menus for a custom set up. The 5100 did not disappoint in any department. With my 5 year old 18-200mm attached the camera at first felt just a little unbalanced but 5 minutes later it felt a lot better to me than it did on my old D200. Results have amazed me especially at the ISO6000 level and above, and just for fun,I put it up against the D200, my neighbors D3 and my son's D2X - have to say the 5100 blew them all away using an old 50mm f1.4 ai-s in manual focus of course! I cannot fathom the comments from a recent reviewer, who signs off as a pro, and who mentions a Canon Rebel having better IQ than the 5100.  No pro I know would use either camera as a day to day working tool, they are just not made for that kind of hard work. Although when you think about it you could buy 6 of the 5100's for less than the price of a D3s. Now that's a thought for a pro who wants to go ultra lightweight! But getting back to the image quality issue, I have to report just one thing - There Is No Issue!! It is a super sharp machine with any decent lens you care to put on it. The video output is excellent and on a Samsung 50' LCD in HDMI mode the picture quality was better than I could ever have hoped for. Crystal clear with outstanding sound quality. OK so it doesn't have a waterproofed Titanium and Kevlar shell, the buttons seem to be getting smaller on all Nikons,the video controls and logic are problematic but no doubt curable with a firmware upgrade.The liveview switch is not exactly conveniently placed either and I could go on with other picky findings. But overall this Nikon rocks!""

"20110607","3.0","Nikon D5100 Softness Issues","A professional photographer quick-review: I tried different lenses on the D5100 camera: the kit lens (low quality), some old 35mm Nikon prime lenses and the high quality Wide Angle 10.5mm. Results: the old prime lenses gave the sharpest results as usual but none of the Nikon lenses I tested came even close to matching the ultra high resolution I got from the Canon Rebel T3i with the included kit lens. Other than the softness, this is a great camera for low light situations.I don't know why this camera is softer than the Canon but I am not the only one experiencing this issue, you may compare both cameras using the 'Comparometer' online which clearly confirms my findings. I am guessing the T3i Rebel has a better sensor than the Nikon and that is a real pity because I would have preferred to use Nikon. The good news is that the D5100 performs far better than the Canon in low light conditions.By the way, the 1080p video test I shot was unusable, the D5100 does not have anything close to the kind of optical stabilization required for video production and I am not going to carry a tripod when I can use my Canon HV20 camcorder instead without any trouble, it just would not be practical.Despite all these shortcomings, I still would recommend the D5100 for telephoto and low-light still photos (such as wedding photography).Update: After further research it turns out that all Nikon DLSRs in this price range are famous for producing soft images which require sharpening in post. Indeed, I looked at my D60 photos and they are also soft. However, there are rumors that Nikon has plans to switch to a different type of sensor to keep up with the competition. So, maybe before 2012 Nikon will bring good news for all Nikon fans, that is, if the world does not end in 2012.""
"20110605","5.0","Best Light Weight DSLR EVER","Being in Graphic Design, I was in the market for a DSLR, and was reading up on the specs of the D5100. I had only had previous experience with a Canon D60 and proudly owned and used a Nikon FM2 Film Camera for a decent amount of years. (Hence why I went with Nikon again, for the lenses) Since I was looking for a camera for on-the-go shots and night shots, this little baby seemed to come into my life just at the right moment.It is an unbelievably light weight camera, which makes it nice for lugging it around. The body IS Plastic, so it is definitely not ment for you rough and tumble types. The rotating flip screen is a serious plus, for getting those wierd angled shots you would otherwise need to dig a hole to get. All of the features, such as portrait, landscape, etc like point and shoot cameras are featured, although I just use manual settings to custom taylor to my needs.  ISO can get up to 6400, Shutter Speed can get up to 1/4000. The white balance is very nicely programed, pictures come out as if it were my own eyes. (*personal settings apply) Auto focus can be turned on in constance and is pretty responsive when moving the camera around.Never mind the Video capability. (1080p HD?! COOL!) Even little on-unit touch ups like upping digital lighting, or adding a 'Miniature effect' to the photos, it has been quite joyful to even do slight color correcting on the camera in playback.I have only had this camera for a few days, keep in mind. And I did not buy it from Amazon (even though they have the same great price i paid for it.) This camera is a bargain for what you get. I couldn't be any happier, especially with the price. What can I say- I am already in love.""
"20110604","5.0","View from a D700 owner...very impressed","I've had a D700 since it came out and have 10's of thousands of fabulous pictures from it.  Simply the best camera I've ever had....but the thing is a horse!  Strap the 70-200mm f2.8 on it and I'm popping Advil that evening because of the weight.  This of course it the price you pay for the highest quality pictures you can get.Because of the weight issue I've been thinking about getting a compact.  I've tried several Olympus (ZX-1, PEN 1, PEN 2) and found them shall we say lacking in clarity (they just can't stand up to D700 quality and seem like a waist of time).  I wanted to like the P7000, but all the reviews say its a POS.  So, I started looking at the weight of some of these new DSLRs and thought that may be the option for me.  The DP Review rated it quite well, so I figured I would give it a shot.Well I have to say that I'm extremely impressed.  I love the weight and the simple controls.  The articulating screen is sweet and extremely useful.  After I put some decent glass on the thing (the kit lens is a POS!), I have got some fabulous pictures with the thing up to ISO 3200.  The color output is really amazing. Very contrasty and requires little post-processing (I only shoot RAW, so I couldn't tell you about the in camera jpegs).  I think this is from the EXPEED-2 processor and bods very well for a D800.  There is a fair amount of noise reduction, that really softens things too much, but it's easy to take out with capture NX 2.  Overall, I would say that the picture quality is 80 percent of the D700 up to ISO 3200.  This is more than I ever expected for a $800 camera (versus $2500 for a D700).Bravo Nikon!  This is quite a camera and thanks for saving my back!""

"20110603","5.0","Excellent Starter Camera","I received this as a gift just recently. I had quite a difficult decision between the D3100 & D5100 as my FIRST DSLR. I was aware that they were both 'starter' cameras and they had very similar features. What really set me for the D5100 is that it had the swivel screen for the tricky shots and the durability. I like the texture of the body better than the D3100. My specifications were that it had to last a few years, it needed to withstand some wear and tear, it needed quality pictures and videos, but also ease of use. And because it is my first DSLR, I am a little confused with the usage, but I'll learn. I know it takes a lot of practice and a few terrible pictures. I find the Nikon manual very clear and helpful. I do love that it's not a thick, giant camera and it's light and easy to hold with my tiny hands. I did so some research to see that the buttons were placed differently from the D3100, but I find them easy to locate and understand their meaning because it is my first. It takes some awesome shots. Fast. 4fps is very nice to get those quick shots. Crisp, detailed, clean. I haven't had much time of playing around with the special effects. I believe that my current settings are on manual. I'm not a big fan of automatic mode. I had a digital camera and that mode was pretty terrible. And I don't want to miss any special shots on auto-mode. Overall, I would recommend this camera. The price is a bit much for pretty much a step up starter camera. It has come down from $899, but by $40. I would recommend this. Still need some getting used to, but so far, it's worth the price and hopefully will last for a long time. :)""
"20110602","4.0","D5100 and then some!","I own both the D5100 and D7000, both are formable still cameras and do decent video as well.

Where the D5100 shines is decent still shots but a tad better video quality if your using the right lens, as it will shoot 1080p/24p/30p where the D7000 shoots only 1080p/24p, and this is where the articulating upgraded LCD comes into play, makes filming with this camera a tad more enjoyable and more flexible. I do wish however they would have put 1080p/60p on this camera, but hopefully in time on another model.Pro's and Con's:Pro's:Great articulating high end LCDLight weight makes it easier for shooting videoGood SensorDecent Auto FocusGood Lens selection in DX lineupGood adjustment layout for the most partGreat Video 1080p/24p/30p selectionIn camera HDROther OptionsPriceCon's:Live View switch in horrible spot when trying to switch to videoLive View sluggish when taking pictures etc.Lens selection limited to newer lensesAuto Focus much slower in live view mode.No Motor, needs AFS lenses, so lens selection is limited to those lenses.Over all great Mid-line camera that shoots terrific pictures and does decent video!""

(Microphone slot, rotating screen, faster system, etc)D5000 is okay but D5100 is going to be the definite upgrade from it. Why? I personally think that D5100 has better image quality, better rotating screen function, and.. it looks better- smaller in size, less bulky.. D5100 looks much sharper than D5000.. i think at least.D7000 takes the best picture but it goes over $1000 and it feels very similar to D5100, so why not get D5100 for $400-500 cheaper?So bottom line, I decided to keep D5100 for a while and I am loving this beast every bit of it.

I don't mind the use of a plastic body for lighter weight as there's enough heft to this camera (and the 18-200 lens) to make you aware that you are holding something of significant value.  I've reassigned the 'Fn' button to adjust the ISO on the fly since I primarily use aperture priority (nice touch btw).  I'm currently looking into the ideal camera bag for travel... possibly the Lowepro Fastback 250, as I want to keep the 18-200 lens attached.The built-in flash does NOT work as 'commander' for wireless flash use... not a deal breaker though.""
"20110529","5.0","Better than the d7000, for my needs","I spent a few months looking at the d7000, but I was afraid of some of the reported problems with dead pixels and overexposure. Plus, the d7000 is a lot of camera for someone like me. I know how to shoot in manual mode, but I don't always need to. Sometimes the scene modes are enough for me when I'm trying to get pictures on the fly. I'm just looking to take great pictures and I wanted a great camera with low-light performance.The d5100 turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. Don't underestimate the usefulness of the articulating screen. Its really great for taking self-portraits, or pictures of you and your friends when you don't have a tripod. I have used that feature alone a lot more than I thought I would, and this makes it well more suited than the d7000 for me. The d5100 is also alot lighter than the d7000, and I appreciate some of the gimmicky features that it has (the special scene modes, like sketch and miniature). No overexposure/metering issues in bright sunny days and the same low-light performance of the d5100 makes it a winner for me.Another point is that the battery life of the d5100 is really good. I thought it would be too short, especially when the d7000 gets almost twice as many shots as the d5100 on the included battery. But as long as you charge the battery each night, you should be fine for a full day's worth of shooting.""

"20110523","5.0","Awesome camera!!","I read every review imaginable for this camera, from different sites DPreview, snapsort, cnet, ken rockwell, reviews from users here on amazon, best buy, b&H, etc.  Since this was my first DSLR I wanted to make sure I was confident in making such a big investment.  Ken Rockwell made a good point in 'Cameras have nothing to do with taking great pictures. To take great pictures, you have to know How to Take Great Pictures'.  Let me start by saying that I am a complete novice who is graduating from a Canon elf point and shoot, and I'm already taking fantastic pictures with minimal effort. (at least in my opinion). I can only imagine what kind of pictures I will be taking once I really master the camera and all it has to offer with all its different settings.  I'm so into it that I'm actually signing up for photography courses. I didnt know whether I would use the video, but I have used it quite a few times as well and I am pleased with the results.  You do hear the autofocus motor noise in the playback, though, if you were to continue using it heavily as a camcorder you would need to get the separate stereo mic.""

Suffice it to say that I am now a Nikon man.Our choice was between the Canon T3i and the Nikon D5100. After reading countless reviews I cam to the conclusion that either camera was a good choice, but the Nikon has better image quality and low light performance.I am amazed at the photos this produces. I shot a quick pic of my dog under kitchen florecent lights without a flash (ISO2000) and the picture looked fantastic. Don't get all starry eyes on mega-pixel numbers. The Canon does have more pixels, but this camera has a larger sensor meaning each pixel can gather more light.I have also been pleased with it's ease of use. My wonderful wife has had nothing but point-and-shoots but is already up and running on Auto, A and S mode. Also, in the easo of use catagory, I love the fact that is I don't know what a function is or does I can press the '?' button and get a brief explanation there in the camera.The Canon does have more options for shooting video, but in the side by side comparisons I saw the Nikon produced better video, especially in low light.Did it mention it does HDR in camera?I was not disappointed by this camera, and recommend it.""
"20110517","2.0","Nikon D5100 - Maybe I just got a lemon; it happens.","Maybe I just got a lemon; it happens.  Colors looked great; control layout was fine with me. I thought this would be the perfect step up from my D40.  I loved everything about the camera, except one thing - poor image sharpness.  I started in P mode (custom settings for everything), which is how I use my D40.  Later, I also tried Auto Mode Landscape and Auto Mode Macro.  I worked my way up to Quality settings of JPEG Fine and Large and gradually increased sharpness setting up to maximum and still could not make it happen.  Thinking it might be the kit lens; I took the 18-200 VR off of my D40 and tried that. Unfortunately, the results were the same.  Many, many others have had no complaints about image sharpness, so I am going to have to assume that my camera was defective.  It happens. I did not try the video function. Amazon accepted my return without question.""
"20110516","5.0","Great Image Quality & Usability at an a Affordable Price","The image Quality from the D5100 is outstanding for the price. The features of the D5100 are easy to deploy in general photography, without the usual complexity of figuring how to deploy them. This is why I bought the camera. It's just easy to use the relatively advanced features.The Hi1 and Hi2 ISO modes are useful when you need to capture images at lower quality in lower light, and the high grain effect of the ISO 102,000 is a lot of fun. The in-camera editing capability is fun, but doesn't replace in-computer editing functionality. It's handy nonetheless if you need to do edit images quickly after shooting, before uploading them online, for example.For a first time Nikon Digital SLR user, the position of the buttons, Live View etc are very intuitive and the redeployed buttons don't pose the challenge that users of older Nikon DSLR models claim. The LCD Viewfinder is as good as other reviewers have commented and while the Depth of Field preview is missing, the LCD screen preview works (for me anyway). Being able to assign the ISO Level to the button beside the flash button makes it even easier to use the camera without having to navigate the menus to get the right shot settings.The kit lens is OK as a starter lens, and I agree with other reviewers that you'll want to add better lenses to take advantage of the amazing images this camera is capable of producing. I've added the Stereo Microphone for some HD Videos I've produced and it's worth the money only if you need to do tripod based videso with very clear sound. Otherwise the built in Mic is fine.All in all, a great buy. Absolutely delighted with it.""

I don't want get involved in time consuming RAW post processing to achieve what should be a natural photo.  With all the scene modes and options on the camera why can't Nikon (the experts in color) get this right? Nikon has a 4 axis color chart where you can tweek their colors in a sub-menu but that option is too coarse for fine tuning.

The ease of going through the menus and changing settings is great. There are also images inside the menues so you have an idea of what those settings are used for and will do when you change them. I work in a rural area and on the way back from lunch I was able to snap a couple quick shots of ducks in the ditches that turned out really great (even on a lower image quality) after only having the camera for a few hours. From a beginner's stand point this couldn't be easier to use. I highly reccomend this camera.""
"20110501","4.0","Could be a great camera but.....","I'm a professional architectural photographer who shoots with a Nikon D700. I have achieved amazing results over the years with my D700+14-24mm lens. However, when you're almost 70 years old with a bad back, lugging around a heavy camera and wide angle lens can be a daunting task - not to mention having to stoop down constantly to look through the viewfinder. Enter the Nikon D5100. Yep. I will dare to admit that I was astounded by the quality of the Nikon D5100 + Sigma 10-20mm lens. WHAT? No Nikon lens? I tried Nikon's version and didn't like it. Got better results with a $479 Sigma lens. My clients can't tell the difference. WHAT?  As good as a full frame camera?  Yes. But, there are things that I do miss.  The ability to change K temperature. Also the ability to bracket 9 shots but the D5100 does an amazing job with 3 shots by using +/- 2EV. The D700 is +/- 1EV.  Another thing that annoys me with the D5100 is the sound of the shutter. It's not distinct as the D700. Sometimes I have a hard time telling when the shutter has been fully completed when bracketing. For some reason, it makes several distinct noises unlike the D700 is final after shooting the last frame. I won't comment on the other raves reviews that have been given the D5100. They're all true and would be redundant to mention them. One last annoyance is the build of the D5100. Very plasticky and cheap feeling but it's probably because I'm so used to the magnesium alloy feel of the D700 and also the price to pay for a much lighter camera. But at this price I can afford 2 backup D5100s. I'm now eagerly awaiting the next DSLR offering from Nikon. They just get better and better with each introduction.""
"20110501","5.0","Great Simple DSLR","I've only had the D5100 for a few days, and I love it. I loved it out of the box. Before buying it, I'd been considering the more expensive Nikon D7000 and the Canon EOS 60D. But being the type of guy who is in general very technology/gadget challenged, I knew I'd never use 90% of the available features on either camera, so I couldn't really justify the extra expense.What I love immediately about the D5100 is how easy it is to use right out of the box. Pictures are of course phenomenal, and in particular I've enjoyed using the 'Night Vision' effect setting to capture some excellent black & white images of my pets in poor lighting without having to irritate them with a flash. Video is terrific and very easy to use. I expect I'll have a ton of fun with this camera.Cons? It's a bit plasticky feeling, but do I really care? No. I won't be lugging this camera to the top of Mt. Everest, nor shooting action pics in the rain. One issue is that it is virtually impossible to find a compatible fast fixed focal length 85mm+ portrait lens unless you want to spend significantly more than you paid for the camera itself - which I do not. For this camera's motor to drive the lens in AF, you will need to use AF-S/AF-I lenses only, and there are not a lot of great [fast] affordable portrait lens options in that class, IMHO. But being at most a very casual photo kind of guy, I can live with that shortcoming. The kit lens takes wonderful shots.Overall, I'm extremely pleased and I expect that anyone wanting a good camera for casual photo/video use will be as well.""

The D3100 also has a lower resolutions screen and no HDR.The D5100 is a much better camera with features worth the extra $300 over the D3100. Having built-in HDR is a big plus for high contrast shots. 1080p video is just as good (if not better) than any dedicated HD camcorder. The higher resolution screen makes it much easier to evaluate shots. Being able to swivel the screen is also a major upgrade especially when you are trying to shoot at wierd angles. The in-camera special effects can be called 'gimmicky' but they really are fun to use and will spice up any photos.If you are going to spend $600 on the D3100 you might as well bump that up to $900 for the D5100. You will be happy you did because in the long run you will not only have a fantastic DSLR, but a really top notch HD video camera.""
"20110425","5.0","Nice DSLR! Great images!","I have been a retired SLR photographer for several years so the D5100 is my re-entry into DSLR.  Previously, I had an N90s and one of the first digital Nikons; the D20.  I have been shooting a Canon G10 for several years even doing some HDR with it.  I've had the D5100 about a week and have shot a 100 photos on a variety of subjects - family, landscape, sunset, and macro - all with the 18-55 kit lens.It shoots great!  Detail is way better than I expected for a 'consumer' model.  Actually, I chose the D5100 because the quality of the pics was my foremost goal.  It comes with the same 16mp chip as the D7000 for $400 less.  I wanted to spend that money on glass.  I've had almost no trouble figuring out how to set the manual controls and have had good luck with the SCENES modes for most shooting.  (I haven't tried the EFFECTS and I'm not sure that I will - more of a Photoshop processing kind of guy).  My biggest challenge has been getting correct focus as the camera tries to do way more than I'm used to and, if I have it in the wrong SCENE mode, there's no telling what might happen.  The dancing yellow squares on the face recognition function is a little disconcerting.  I have also had to learn patience as the VR function is nice but a little slow when handheld.  I have learned to leave it off until I really need it.I think that most of the professional reviewers overstate the weaknesses of many of the products out there and the D5100 is no exception, maybe because it's hard to difference a crowded competitive product line.  At any rate, here is my take on some of the deficiencies.  First, the location of the LiveView button work great for me.  Because it is a lever rather than a button it is easy to locate and use without moving my hand on the grip.  Another complaint has been the lack of an ISO button.  I do prefer buttons over menus but there are too many functions which I would like to have on a button that there wouldn't be room for all of them.  I programmed the fn button (which is done easily in the menus) to allow me to control the ISO.  It works well both when I'm working through the viewer or the display screen.  I will agree with complaints that the fn button is too close to the flash button.  I've inadvertently mixed them up and it cost me a pic or two.  However,  I only need to make that kind of mistake a couple of times before learn to avoid the problem.The rear screen is great...very high resolution.  The zooming function works well and I have been able to check image focus easily.  The side tilt is very elegant and I like that if flips to protect the screen when not in use.I'm not much of a videographer but I did shoot some video and the image quality if fantastic.  I put it on my TV and the quality was great.  The focus works pretty well although you can see it occasionally get behind for a few seconds for quick moving subjects - like cars and kids.  The microphone isn't worth much so it may be worth investing in the add-on microphone for more serious video projects.All in all, the quality and fit of the camera is very good in spite of being made from plastic.  i wouldn't want to drop it or the lens for that matter - they are not made like my old N90s or my 70-200 f2.8 but, on the other hand, I won't won't miss the extra 5 lbs. of weight because this camera is LIGHT!  It is small but fits the hand well and is joy to carry around.To summarize:  As you would expect from a Nikon, great photos; as good as the D7000 (according to dpreview) and $400 less.  Easy to use, light, good manual control, and good assisted control through scenes.  The D5100 is a good choice if you are looking for high quality images without all the bells and whistles of the D7000.No 'cons' except don't drop it...probably won't survive!  Battery life isn't great either (I tend to use the display and LiveView a lot) so I've already invested in a backup battery.""
"20110424","4.0","It's a good camera with a few reservations (especailly the HDR feature)","As with any review, a lot is dependent on the reviewer's taste, expectations and understanding of the product. So let me make it clear where I fit in there and then how this camera performed.I have a lot of photography and video experience but I am not a professional. What I EXPECT is a camera that is easy to use but powerful in features. I like seeing new technology even when it is sometimes inferior to older technology (I know some of you can relate to that). I expect good build quality and I expect that a camera does what it is advertised to do. This camera basically did not disappoint. But I will say honestly that I was comparing this to the D7000 even though the latter is a good $400 more expensive. But the D5100 was newer and it had some things the D7000 does not have that I thought were important to me:1. A swivel screen (I've never had a still camera with that). I am upgrading from a D70.2. Capable of HDR pictures with in-camera processing.3. Cheaper and lighter weight.Many of you may choose the D5100 for other reasons but these were mine. In the end, I returned it and bought the D7000 (that review is coming soon). Here is why:I like the idea of HDR photography and the D5100 can do it right in the camera! To explain why I gravitated towards this particular feature, I need to step back and mention an in-camera feature I had once on a point-and-shoot.  I used to have an HP camera and it helped you frame a panoramic picture. When you were done, it stitched it together. Voila! You had a panoramic picture ready to go. When I upgraded to the next model, it also had a panoramic feature to help you frame it, but it did not do in-camera stitching (as most all cameras do not these days). Instead, you are supposed to stitch it with the software the camera comes with. So guess what happened? Nothing....I stopped doing panoramic pictures, because I was too lazy to take the time to find the right pictures, import them into the software, stitch and then export it back to the right folder - too much hassle.Well, the idea with in-camera HDR was a real selling point for me on the D5100. As of this writing, I am not aware of any other camera that does this (I'm sure someone will correct me?). So this may be the #1 reason I ended up getting the D5100 and it is the #1 I returned it. If you look at Nikon's website they advertise this feature and show an example of a lighthouse - the result is stunning, just as you would expect from HDR. Let me just say flat-out: this will not be the result you see in the real-world. I took about 100 different high-contrast shots and most of them looked better with the HDR processing but most of them only looked *marginally* better. The shadows had more detail and the bright areas were less blown out. So it works. But I then bracketed +2,0,-2 images and plugged them into Photomatrix and BAM! Now that's HDR! No comparison whatsoever. It turns out, the Nikon D5100's version of HDR is to take just two shots (-3,+3 , or some variation on the stops) and then it combines it into one image. If the (+3) shot was a little blurry, because over-exposed shots tend to be this way, then the final HDR image is blurry too. Now when this happens on a bracketed set, that is OK, because you still have the normal (0) exposure to take back with you at the end of your vacation. But if the D5100 made a bunch of blurry shots, you are hosed. There is no way to recover from that. You would have to analyze every shot closely on that little 3' screen to verify you got the shot or you would need to take duplicates with normal exposure just to make sure. Also, the HDR feature is not even written in the instruction manual - go ahead and look...no where to be found! I had to look it up in the longer online pdf manual to see how to use the feature, and it turns out you have to press about 6 buttons pretty deep in the menu just to get the camera to take an HDR. Once you depress the shutter, you have to go back through the whole menu again. Ridiculous! Finally, I figured out you can assign the 'Fn' button to handle this, which was really a very good workaround. So all in all, I was really excited about in-camera HDR and in reality, it was a big disappointment. Now on to the other stuff:The swivel screen: You either love it or hate it. I hated it, but that has nothing to do with the actual camera, just the concept. Basically I think it's mechanically the weakest point of the camera. That little swivel is just asking to snap off the next time I chase my son around the house and back into a corner or cabinet. I can guess it would cost a fortune to have Nikon fix that. Also, I am not into swiveling the screen closed so the screen faces the camera when I am done shooting. I am simply not that meticulous. I want to have a spontaneous camera that I can pick up and shoot whenever I want. So what's the point if I have to un-swivel the screen every time I want to use it and then swivel it closed when I am done. Also, think of all that wear-and-tear. So if you don't close it properly then it is liable to get scratched over time. The D7000 and all the other fixed LCD DSLRs have a plastic screen protector that costs a few bucks to replace - you can't really use a screen protector on the D5100. So either you swivel it closed every time or you risk scratching the screen. In the end, I felt the swivel screen took away from my spontaneity and made me think about not scratching the screen all the time.Now a few general things: The camera is lighter and cheaper than the D7000. That can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. But for how much this camera costs, I don't want it to feel cheap - and it does. I compared both cameras and it was the little things like how the buttons felt and how the grip was shaped that made the D5100 feel a lot cheaper. Also the 18-55mm lens it comes with is really very limiting. I am not interesting in being one of those people that walks around with 3 lenses in a huge 10lb bag that I carry everywhere. The D7000 comes with the 18-105mm which is not amazing, but it is much better for general use. I personally went with the Tamron 18-270mm, but that's another story. Here are some other things to consider: The D5100 has a bunch of 'Effects' like 'miniature', 'fisheye', etc. These can be done much more easily in the D5100 than in the D7000 where you have to apply the effect to a picture after you take it while the D5100 applies it immediately to the picture. But these are just gimmicks for me - you try the effect out once and move on.After thoroughly playing with the D5100, the D7000 became an easy choice. For $400 (of course, it's $400 when you compare just the cost of the bodies not the kits) you get a lot of manual buttons so you don't have to dive into menus to change things. You get a dedicated screen on the top that gives you critical info. You get a weather-sealed case with the top and back being magnesium alloy. You get 2 custom user settings, faster more precise focusing and a better lens with the kit. So you say, 'no duh, you pay more, you get more'. That is true, but my logic was that the D5100 is not really all that cheap to begin with. If I'm shelling out serious cash for a DSLR, it better not feel like a toy in my hand - the D5100 feels like a toy. It also has very few buttons which means any time you want to make a change, you need to dive into a menu. Gosh I hate that! I have a Canon G10 which is more capable - at least it has an ISO and exposure dial right there on the top - no menus no nothing, and it is just a fancy point-and-shoot.As for the video, I appreciated the fact that the D5100 takes 1080p at 30FPS unlike the D7000 which maxes out at 24FPS. I do video with a far more capable dedicated video camera, so I didn't really bother with this. But from the little I saw, the built-in microphone was weak and the auto-focus was sluggish, inaccurate and loud ( you can hear the focusing in your video). I would only use the camera's video if I was desperate. The D7000 performed no better.As far as picture quality goes, I am not a pro, but I did compare identical pictures to the D7000 at the pixel level and I am convinced they are the same chips. The pictures are simply awesome. Beautiful color, sharp, clean and excellent light sensitivity. You really will have a hard time complaining.IN CONCLUSION: Although it 'feels' like a toy after you hold the D7000, it is a well-built camera that takes excellent pictures and can do most of the same things the D90 and D7000 are capable of - you just have to hunt for the stuff you need. I do not like hunting for things when a photo-opportunity arises. The HDR feature is mostly useless and could potentially ruin some pictures. The swivel LCD may be useful for some but I did not like it. If the camera is used mainly for a family get-together, a European vacation or even to take short videos of your kids and pets, then this is an excellent choice. If you are like me and enjoy HDR photography, astrophotography, macro-shots and have a deeper understanding of how all the features of how cameras work (like why you would change the metering from 'Matrix' to 'spot' or why it's useful to change ISO settings all the time, etc) then you will be really frustrated by the D5100 - you are better off spending the money and getting the D7000. I give this camera 4 stars because the HDR feature was a big selling point and it is useless by my standard. I would knock off another half-star for not having at least a dedicated button to change ISO and for having weak video capabilities, but I'm feeling generous tonight ;)I hope you found this review helpful. I will try to do a more complete review of the D7000 soon.""

But for somebody who is entering the dslr world for the first time, he will never regret with D5100.I just used the Auto mode and took some pics and 1080p videos and they came out of the world.Cant be more happier.""
"20110423","5.0","Outstanding Camera","I own a Nikon D300 and I love that camera. It's a work horse, but it's heavy. I was looking for a camera that I could use as more of an every day type of camera. You know, something to grab to take a few shots without a lot of fuss, weight and fooling with settings. In other words, a fun, easy to use camera.I had purchased one of the Micro Four Thirds cameras because it was light and small, but I found the quality lacking when compared to APS-C cameras. Also, most of the available Micro Four Thirds lenses are way too expensive for the quality you get with them; they're not that great. (The exception is the Panasonic 20mm lens - that's a good lens. Perhaps still a bit expensive.)Enter the D5100. When I saw this camera, I knew it would be exactly what I was looking for. It's small, lightweight, easy to use but still maintains superb image quality. It's really outstanding in low light. I don't know what kind of algorithms Nikon is using, but shooting at ISO 1600 is no problem. Even the shots at ISO 3200 look good and clean up nicely.The great thing about this camera is that it's versatile and flexible. You can shoot in auto, or you can use Aperture or Shutter priority for more control. If you're an advanced user, you'll be happy for the manual mode that allows you total control.This camera really is the best of both worlds. A camera that an advanced amateur can use and at the same time feel confident that he/she can hand over to an inexperienced spouse or friend and know that the camera won't be too much for them to handle.It's really a nice fit between the D3100 (more features, same sensor as the D7000) and less expense and bulk of the D7000. Plus, I love the flip out LCD.""
"20110423","5.0","Compact little beastie","The Nikon D5100 was the 4th camera in line of cameras I wanted to get. Initially, I was looking at a D3100 and then realized that I could get a T2i for the same price. After seeing that, I was about to purchase a T2i until the catastrophe in Japan occurred and I was SOL and had to buy a T3i. Okay, fine. I then was about to buy the T3i when I saw the rumored release date/specs of the D5100. After that, i had to wait it out until the D5100 came out. And let me tell you, the D5100 out classes all of them in every single way. The D5100 has so many added features on top of the expected ones that it really makes shooting with this camera fun and exciting.The body feels very comfortable in the hand and if it were any smaller, it would be hard to hold but at the same time if it were any bigger it would likely result in a cumbersome body. The controls have been moved all over the place because of the articulating display, which is actually pretty awesome. I didn't really think i needed an articulating display until I realized how many more shots are easier now that I don't have to have my face directly to the viewfinder all the time. I also really enjoyed all of the special effects in the camera as well as the 11 auto-focus points which is more than its Canon competitors.The camera's overall button layout is pretty nice and since I've never used a Nikon before and haven't really gotten used to say the D3100 or D7000 layout, it makes me happy and I've gotten pretty good at pressing whats needed within a reasonable amount of time. Some people have griped about this, but coming from someone that hasn't owned a DSLR in years its quite decently laid out.When shooting video, there's nothing too fancy it basically lets you do whatever you can do when shooting stills. You get a wide range of resolutions and frame rates between 720P and 1080P from 24FPS to 30FPS. Its smooth and easy to do, and the capture limit is 20 minutes, and there's a tilt-shift effect which is really cool and I recommend everyone try it out.So far, the pop-up flash hasn't been used much by me but in the situations where its needed I've been pretty satisfied with the amount of light and lighting options. Futhermore, the battery life of the actual camera is halfway decent. I wouldn't say its fantastic, but I also wouldn't say it horrid. Its somewhere in the middle and if you do a lot of shooting you're going to need atleast one backup battery.The Kit lens definitely leaves more to be wanted, but it is a kit lens there really isn't much you can expect from it. My recommendation is to buy a 35mm or 50mm prime as well as a telephoto lens as well, those two lenses in combination with the kit lens are the perfect combination and will likely set you back about $500.The nice thing about this camera that I didn't realize is that it actually comes with the USB cable that you need to connect it to the computer which apparently the D3100 is missing(WTH?). Needless to say, I'm quite happy with this camera so far and hope to keep enjoying this all day every day.""
"20110422","5.0","outstanding "prothusiast" D-SLR, solid upgrade from my D5000","As a long-time owner of the Nikon D5000, and former owner of the Nikon D60, I was eager to purchase the D5100 after seeing the announcements and pre-reviews. Being one of the lucky ones to buy the D5100 with 18-55VR kit earlier this week, I've had a few days to play with this camera and can honestly say it's a solid upgrade to the D5000 I'm replacing, and should be on the short list of consideration for any 'prosumer' looking to purchase a D-SLR with outstanding image quality, performance, and low-light capability in a lightweight, compact (for an SLR) body. And, unlike the D5000, this D-SLR finally has a usable Live View and HD video capabilities both with continuous autofocus.First of all, it's important to understand where the D5100 fits in Nikon's capabilities. It is considered a 'high-end enthusiast' D-SLR which means that it shares the same image sensor as the high-end D7000 without some of the higher-end features. If you're like me, very few of the D7000's features justify its extra cost and weight. The D5100 offers nearly the same image quality as its bigger brother in a less-expensive, smaller package, while adding a few tricks the D7000 doesn't have including an articulating display that helps you frame hard-to-reach spots.Compared to its lesser-priced but still excellent brother the D3100, the D5100 offers improved image quality, speed, and resolution, along with a higher-resolution articulating display. For me, this is the sweet spot in Nikon's consumer D-SLR offerings.The 18-55VR (3x) f3.5-f5.6  kit lens provides surprisingly good performance and image quality, although you'll likely outgrow it quickly. I have uploaded a few sample images taken with the D5100 and 18-55VR to show its performance and surprisingly good bokeh (pattern of blurred background) in large-aperture and macro shots.For lens upgrades that include an AF-S autofocus motor, if you don't mind changing lenses, the Nikon 55-200VR is an outstanding value with excellent image quality, or consider the Nikon 18-105VR (5.8x) lens included with the D7000. If you don't mind some distortion and image softness, the 18-200 VRII (18x) lens may be your perfect 'walkabout' lens. For me, I bought the pricey but outstanding Nikon 16-85mm VRII. Don't forget the Nikon AF-S 35mm f1.8 (if you can find it).Low-light performance is outstanding with this camera, and the level of detail captured by the D5100 is excellent, even at higher ISOs. You're best capturing in RAW or RAW+JPEG mode (three different JPEG compression levels are offered) if you need to go back and fine-tune exposure or other settings after the shot. Nikon also offers 'Active D-Lighting' which is a highly effective method for improving dynamic range of a photo to equalize the difference between high and low-light areas of a photo.Interestingly, the improvement in image quality compared to my D5000 isn't dramatic. Given the incredible improvement I saw when upgrading from my Nikon D60 to the D5000 perhaps I had unrealistic expectations for this new sensor. But in most image settings, even low light, the improvement is noticeable but subtle. That speaks more for the outstanding quality and low-light sensitivity of the D5000 sensor (which is shared with the D90) than it speaks against the D5100. With the D5100 you get higher resolution for improved cropping, and the 14-bit RAW images offer greater dynamic range for more flexibility after the shot is taken.Speaking of RAW format, as with any new camera, there is a bit of a wait until updates are available for your favorite camera software. As of May 18th, Adobe, Apple, and Nikon have added support for the D5100 RAW files, so you can use Aperture, iPhoto, Nikon View NX2 (v2.1.1 and later), Nikon Capture NX2 (v2.2.7 and later), Lightroom 3 or Photoshop CS5 (via Adobe Camera RAW 6.4 or later). If you use other photo software or another platform, you may want to verify RAW support for the D5100.Compared to my D5000, Nikon has gone back and addressed most of my concerns on ergonomics and performance:- camera body is roughly 10% smaller and 10% lighter- 16.2 megapixel CMOS DX-format image sensor (shared with D7000) captures 14-bit RAW images and offers +1fs greater low-light sensitivity- ISO 100-6400 range with expansion to 25,600 ISO (D5000 minimum is 200 and expansion to 12,300)- high resolution (920k pixel) display for greater detail in image previews (although I had to bump up the default brightness one notch for accuracy)- side-mounted articulating display no longer interferes with tripod (the D5000 display is inconveniently hinged at the bottom)- dramatically improved (now usable!) LiveView mode with continuous autofocus even in HD video mode (more on that later)- full HD 1080p movie capture without the 'jelly effect' (unless you move VERY quickly from side-to-side), in more standard H.264 mode up to 22 min (D5000 is AVI format 720p up to 5min)- slightly better control position (LiveView is now a rocker switch on the mode dial, Video Record is just behind and to the left of the shutter release)- significantly quieter shutter release (plus, a 'Quiet Mode' is available although hardly necessary)- faster performance (4 frames per second)- SDXC compliant supports higher capacity cards- remote control sensor on rear now in addition to front-mounted sensor- improved battery life, and an improved battery release- battery charger now has built-in collapsable plug instead of requiring separate power cord- MUCH better eyecap design no longer comes off in my small Nikon camera bag; also an improved diopter (eyeglass) control- additional in-camera editing capabilities, including ability to trim video- new 'gimmick' special effects: in-camera HDR, selective color, night vision, etcLet's start with the display - moving the hinge to the side not only makes the articulating display usable with a tripod, it makes the camera body shorter, so that it matches the height of most popular Nikon DX-format lenses and no longer leans forward when set down on a table as the D5000 did. It makes a surprising improvement in shooting comfort also. Nikon has improved the rubberized grip of the body and the thumb rest in the rear, although some have said that the grip is a bit shallow for larger hands. For my average-sized hands it is very comfortable.The improved control placement is mostly welcome as well. LiveView is now a spring-release rocker on the side of the Mode Dial (VERY handy) and the video record button is also now on the top of the body, in front of the mode dial and behind the shutter release. What I didn't care for is the placement of the rear camera buttons, which now all shift above and to the right of the display to accommodate the left-mount hinge. What I don't like is that the 'i' button (used to display and change shooting info) is too far away from the 4-way mode switch, so changing default shooting settings is a bit more of a stretch on my thumb. On playback, the delete button is just to the right of the Zoom buttons, instead of being far away like it should be. I didn't find myself accidentally deleting photos, but I'd rather have had a button closer by that I use more frequently (like the Menu button?) With these two buttons near each other, I always found myself accidentally hitting the 'I' button instead of RECORD to capture video. So watch your screen and make sure you actually are recording when you think you are!What has dramatically improved from the D5000 is LiveView performance and HD video capture. Neither are perfect, but compared to my D5000 both are quite usable in the D5100. In LiveView mode, the D5100 tracks faces and subjects quickly and accurately, although still nowhere near fast enough for sports events or that 'quick shot' like you might be used to with a compact camera. On my D5100, LiveView autofocus typically took half a second in lower-light conditions, which is no match for the viewfinder, but a huge improvement from the D5000.Video capture is another notable improvement in the D5100, capturing single videos up to 22 minutes of 1080p HD (if you have the SD card capacity), in H.264 format, with continuous autofocus. Nearly gone is the 'jelly effect' of the D5000 when you panned horizontally and the video appeared to bend. Compared to video captured on the D5000 which almost always exhibited this 'jelly effect', I have seen none of these artifacts except in the most extreme fast horizontal pans.  In theory, the continuous autofocus sounds like a great improvement for video capture, but in practice I found it slow to react (especially in low-light situations). Too often I found the camera 'searching' for the correct focus, even with the (optional) Nikon 35mm F1.8 AF-S lens. It was so distracting that I ended up disabling autofocus and learning how to manually adjust focus as I moved from subject to subject. Also disappointing is that like the D5000, the built-in microphone is monoral. For stereo sound, I highly recommend the Nikon ME-1 external microphone (which doesn't require batteries and mounts in the hot shoe). Overall, the video capabilities are promising, especially at 1080p, but I am more satisfied with the native 720pHD stereo video captured from my Canon S95.Rounding out the list of improvements and new features of the D5100 are the new 'special effects', including the first in-camera HDR mode for any Nikon D-SLR. In practice, while there may be edge cases for these effects, I am not particularly impressed with any of them, including HDR. First of all, you cannot capture RAW with any of the effects. For HDR, there are further limitations (can only be used in P-S-A-M modes, not auto, no flash, etc). When you can get HDR mode to work, it can only be enabled one shot at a time, and then you have to go back to the menus to turn it on. Luckily, you can assign HDR mode to the Fn menu button. HDR mode takes two quick shots for each shutter press and then combines them in-camera to create a single JPEG. You can specify the exposure difference (Auto, 1EV, 2EV, 3EV) and level of 'smoothing' (Low, Normal, High) between the captured images. I took a number of high-contrast shots with HDR enabled and honestly couldn't see a difference, although I'm still going to try. If there is any good news, it's that Nikon has chosen a fairly conservative / realistic HDR algorithm as opposed to an 'eye-popping' but over-processed result.In summary, I'm quite happy with the D5100. It provides the optimal balance of top image quality (even in low light), lightweight and compact (for a D-SLR) body, articulating display (the only D-SLR from Nikon to have this), and HD video (not perfect) that can leverage the outstanding collection of Nikon lenses (understanding that only AF-S lenses will autofocus).Notable comparison with the higher-end D7000:- same 16.2megapixel image sensor with 14-bit RAW image capture for outstanding dynamic range, low-light performance, and detail- ruggedized plastic body lacks weather seal (it's also smaller and lighter weight)- no builtin focus motor for older lenses (you'll need to buy an AF-S lens if you want autofocus)- fewer autofocus zones (11 vs 39) and lower-resolution matrix meter- pentamirror viewfinder (smaller, not as bright, 95% coverage) vs pentaprism viewfinder (100% coverage)- no flash commander mode (unless you buy an external flash with TTL triggering)- slower continuous performance (4 vs 6fps)- 1 SD card slot instead of 2- no top-mounted LCD display- fewer dedicated controls for advanced settings (you must use the menu system more frequently)Notable comparison with the lower-end D3100:- higher resolution 16.2megapixel sensor with 14-bit depth- high resolution (920k pixel vs 230k) display, articulating for hard- to-view shots- higher low-light sensitivity- faster performance (4fps vs 3fps)- better battery performance (660 vs 550 images on the same EN-EL14 battery- slightly larger and heavier body""

"20110419","5.0","First-Time DSLR Owner","I got my D5100 with 18-55mm lens kit last night.  I had previously tried the D3100 and returned it after having a little trouble focusing through live view (saw this also on a D5000) as well as not liking the quality and non-rotation of the display panel.  I read much of the pre-release hype and hoped that this would be the one.  The early pro reviews seem to indicate that you will be happier with a jump to the 5100 if you can afford it and I agree.I've had less than a day so far with it and I'm loving this one.  I instantly felt comforable with it in my hand.  It comes with a printed manual and pdf which is nice.  I had a blast this morning shooting birds w/ the Nikkor 70-300 lens.  I was surprised that I could even get some crisp, clear in-flight pictures.  The whole rig just feels comfortable and the quality and rapid action of the sports mode are great for animal pics.All of the pieces and software have worked right out of the box.Very happy so far.  I'm not a pro photographer but want to learn and this seems like a great match.

"20110418","3.0","My Opinion","My personnel opinion is D5000 is better when compare to D5100...because almost 90% of feautures are same when we compare both the cameras...but the price wise there is 250 dollars difference...for the difference i don't think D5100 is worth of money when we compare to D5000.""
"20120514","3.0","OK Camera","PROs: The image quality of the D5100 is fantastic, and the flip out screen is quite nice.CONs: The ergonomics make this camera difficult to hold and the button layout is just OK, and Nikon has crippled the manual controls over video, making it extremely difficult, if not impossible to control.  This is very unfortunate as Canon allows full manual control of video and as I understand it, the soon-to-be-released Nikon D3200 will have full manual control for video.  It's not that Nikon couldn't give us full manual control, it's that Nikon chose not to.  I wish a firmware update would fix this issue, but considering the absolutely lousy service I have received lately from Nikon, I doubt the company will provide a firmware fix because Nikon does not seem to care about it's customers.""
"20120512","4.0","useful but not pro","this camera takes nice pictures as you would expect from a nikon.all of the 'features' and 'modes' are mostly gimmicks and I end up using it in M or manual mode most of the time anyway.the moveable screen is cool but often unnecessary.it actually feels more plastic and less professional than my d40 though it has a superior sensor, faster continuous shooting, wider range of iso, etc.This camera is pretty easy to use if you have ever used a nikon before.the video mode is mostly just for fun as the aperture is selectable but not the exposure or iso setting. typically with a true video camera the frame rate controls the exposure and you can only actually change the iso and the aperture. this camera automatically compensates the exposure to give you an average brightness on the screen.  wtf?  you cannot shoot artful dark scenes because the camera automatically adjusts the exposure or iso for you even when you try to set a desired aperture for a given light condition. this 'feature' actually just hampers any creativity beyond pet or child videos. this feature also ends up giving your vids a lot of grain in lower light. even with a fast lens. 1080p with grain is not very good looking. might as well not be hd.the microphone also sucks.  you could get a better one and plug it in, but the on-board audio controls are extremely basic. better to just record audio to some other device.in summary, don't use any of the built in modes or scene setting, don't use the video, and overall you can take great images with the usual manual settings and your existing set of nikkor lenses for which this camera was designed.""

"20120510","5.0","Nikon D5100 is the shizz!!!!!","The Nikon D5100 with AF-S VR DX 18-55 mm stock lens is my first DSLR.  This camera is absolutely amazing for the price and the photos you can achieve with it.  I also purchased the Polaroid Optics +1 +2 +4 +10 lens kit and I have taken some very good macro shots that I could never take with previous point and shoots or high end digital zoom cameras.  I've only had for just a few days so I am not 100% familiar with all the functions yet.  Most of my use has been in Landscape, Aperture priority and Shutter priority modes but I am already in love with this camera.  The bokeh is amazing with this camera and even better with the Polaroid Optics kit.I highly recommend this camera to anyone that is considering purchasing their first DSLR.  I have played around with Canon but I always went back to Nikon for some reason.  Maybe it was the feel of the camera or the look or the weight, or a combination of all of this most likely.  To me Canon's are like Macs and Nikon's are like PC's.  I am more of a PC guy so I really like the functionality and versatility of Nikon.  But then again everyone has different tastes.  So I say explore and do your research before purchasing a camera but check out the Nikon D5100 before deciding.  I tried over 20 different camera's.  I wanted to spend a lot but the more I thought about it I figured I could achieve the same types of photographs with this camera than a really high end camera and I am very very satisfied with the results so far.  Do NOT spend $24895720489520458 if you are NOT a professional photographer.  Save your money, practice and master technique, purchase good lenses and you will achieve photographs you never dreamed of.""
"20120509","5.0","Love it, except...","I love this camera, and I'm having a great time with it. My only complaint is that it does not have its own autofocus motor, so the lens has to have one.

"20120504","4.0","Great Camera - will not autofocus with older lenses","Love the camera with one exception. If you are an amateur photographer like me and have been using Nikon for years (I bought my first Nikon, a Nikkormat, in 1965), you probably have several lenses. Some of mine are not very old, I bought them after getting my first digital body. Be aware that only the latest generation Nikkor lenses will be able to auto-focus with this camera.  Your older lenses will still work, but you have to manually focus when you use them. I was aware of this when I bought the camera, but though my more recent lenses would work, they don't.""

I will update this review wafter Nikon does something with camera.""
"20120429","4.0","Great for still, so-so for video","I bought this camera to replace my D80 so I could shoot video as well as stills. I use to carry a ultra compact camera or my DV camcorder to shoot video and would have to switch cameras. The camera is great for stills. The big problem with DSLRs is the auto focus during video. The D5100 focuses quickly, but unfortunately hunts for its subject in a pattern of 4 adjustments. It focuses slight in front of subject, then behind, then in front, and finally on the subject. This creates a distracting 'in and out' of focus pattern that I felt was unacceptable. The auto focus function is also noisy and easily picked up on the build in mic. An external mic would be needed for decent sound capture if using auto focus. The D5100 can focus in single shot mode. Meaning you can depress the shutter button to refocus when needed. Ultimately, what I discovered is that D5100 is not appropriate for semi-serious video using auto focus. It is usable for casual video capture if you pre-focus and use manual focus to shoot videos.""
"20120427","5.0","The right choice..","I progressed through a series of point and shoot cameras starting back in 2003 and was happy with their results.  Until, that is, I went to a photography workshop directed to DSLR users where I translated the language of my film camera days to the language of modern image technology.  During the workshop I made a list of features that I wanted and started looking, finally selecting the Nikon D5100 after a couple of weeks learning what the market offered.  The Nikon D5100 was a good choice.The Nikon D5100 takes some study and the features require practice to master. For an old man (60), I am a hi-tech guy capable of learning fast and understanding technical manuals.  It has taken time and effort to get the images I want, primarily landscapes, buildings, locomotives, and oil well pumpjacks.  I am still not satisfied because I know this camera can deliver much more than my present skill level demands.  However, I know it has the capabilities to meet my needs as an amateur as my skills expand.""
"20120425","5.0","It's the photographer, stupid...The d5100 is the best DSLR deal around","First off, I'd say that you need to try out a real camera with your actual phenomenological self before making any decisions on purchasing one.  Terms like sturdier, lighter, heaver, more solid, easier to use, more comfortable, etc., have NO meaning generically. If you wouldn't buy a $75 pair of shoes without trying them on, why on earth would you buy a camera that way? With that in mind, for me the D5100 is perfect. I handled the D7000 and the D5100, and I felt a lot surer with the D5100. Maybe it has to do with my wrists or fingers or whatever, but in the end, it doesn't matter. And when I bought a $30 sleeve that 'gloves' the entire apparatus, psychologically at least, I made up for any 'heft' a heavier camera might offer. Prior to my purchasing this camera, I had a heavier, 'sturdier' Nikon model, and walking around with it for five hours did not make praise its virtues.  More like it tempted me to throw it off a bridge.  There's some talk of the puny number of focal points on this camera. I think there quite enough.  I've done theatrical photography with this camera, and you can imagine focusing is a delicate matter in low light, multiple points of focus imagery, and I had no problem. Which brings me to the 'pro' vs 'consumer' issue. As far as I'm concerned, there's just one major difference between the needs of a 'professional' photographer and an 'am-pro-sum-teur' or whatever dumb appellation people come up with: and that's durability under a wide range of conditions. If photography is your bread and butter, and your shooting 1,000 frames a day -- covering SWAT team assaults or civil wars or photographing mountain goats in the Himalayas on a regular basis, I'd say you need a D800, or even slum it with a D7000.  But otherwise, if you could use the (minimally) $500 you save with the D5100 to take a trip to your favorite secluded island, get it. You might end up with shots you'd never have a chance on taking since you'd never get there geographically in the first place.If your the Benjamin Franklin type, and need to list the pros and cons of everything prior to making a decision, my way of thinking might not work for you. But then again Benjamin Franklin wasn't known for his aesthetic genius; it was for his engineering and diplomatic skills.Last, consider this: on the off chance you LOSE or get your $1,500 to $3,000 camera and all its gear STOLEN, you could be F_____d.  You lose a D5100, just go out and buy another one. I've exhibited my work in galleries, done photojournalism, travel journalism, art nudes, etc., and the captions have never read 'Taken with a XYZD camera.'""

"20120410","5.0","Buy it.","...Seriously. If you're reading reviews here, you're most likely thinking about purchasing the D5100. I'm not yet a professional photographer, but I am a serious enthusiast with the intent of eventually taking my photography to the next level. I am the (proud) owner of a Nikon D60, and I can say that the D5100 is a very strong upgrade from the D60. Improvements in image quality were immediately noticed with the D5100, and low light shooting is awesome with this camera. When I bought my D60, I had high hopes for the low light shooting capabilities, however it ended up falling short of my expectations. The D5100 definitely meets the expectations I originally had for the D60 in regards to low light shooting, and possibly even exceeds them a bit. That being said, the D60 is still a great camera which takes great photos, and I would highly recommend it to anyone starting out in SLR photography. The manual for the D60 is definitely a bit better than the D5100's, and explains things in greater detail. The way the buttons feel on the D5100 when pressed seem cheaper than that of the D60, but that's just an observation of mine from owning both cameras, and someone purchasing the D5100 probably wouldn't even notice this unless they had another camera to compare it to. The D5100 still feels solid and of good quality, and you get professional looking image results, even using the kit 18-55mm lens. With the 35mm f1.8 Nikon prime lens, you get even sharper results, and it is definitely a recommended accessory for anyone who purchases this camera. I purchased this camera in February because I wanted to have it for a vacation I was taking. Needless to say it did not disappoint!For those interested in HDR photography, this camera does have an auto bracketing feature which can be used in conjunction with the self timer, allowing for hands free operation (granted you have a tripod.) However, you can only do one image over and one image under exposed using this option, and the timer (or auto bracketing) have to be reset after each series of images due to the assign button only having the capability of one feature being assigned to it at a time. This is something that I didn't happen to notice in anyone's review here, (maybe I just missed it?) but would have liked to have known ahead of time. Certainly not a deal breaker though, and no reason to give it less than 5 stars. I could go on and on, but there's not much here with everyone's reviews that hasn't already been said. Basically, almost all of the positive comments here are most likely true, and buying this camera should be a purchase that you won't regret. Especially when it's on sale! It's essentially a less professional version of the D7000 with the same image quality for half the price. I originally wanted the D7000, but couldn't justify the price. I can say with confidence that I made the right choice by saving my money and going for the D5100. Invest in some good lenses, because that's going to make the biggest difference!""
"20120409","1.0","D5100 - Black photos (defective shutter)","After just TWO MONTHS of use, my D5100 will only take black photos. Doesn't matter what settings you use - M, P, A, S, Auto - they are all black. Even the LCD shows a black screen during LiveView. Like others here on Amazon who have rated with 1 star, I apparently have a defective shutter. Really surprising to me, considering how much a baby my electronics, especially this camera. I am positive this is a problem with quality control, given how many comments you can find about it here and on DPreview. Now I have to decide if I want to get it repaired and forever worry that it will fail me in the future, or just start over with another model.If not for this defect, I would likely rate the camera 4 stars.""
"20120405","5.0","Official Nikon Fan, Great Upgrade!","I upgraded from the Nikon D-40 partly because I just thought it was time. 11 focusing points on this camera makes a huge difference for me. I took some great photos with the D-40 and still own it with some reluctance. Re-sell value is terrible and its to great a camera to simply give away for a measly couple of hundred bucks considering I paid almost then what I paid for this now. So with that comparison alone it makes this camera a buy. Thought about the 3100 but remembered my experience with reasons for upgrading so why not spend a few more dollars now. I couldn't afford the next level up so this is it. Honestly, I still have a ton to learn and so far this camera is superb. The thing that really has me convinced is that when I used a trial edition of adobe Lightroom 4 the actual shot photo (to me) looks better than what they are trying to change it to. Granted I still have a lot to learn but just going by what I see when I compare the photos so not sure about software too much. But my naked eye tells me there are times when there is no reason to change the tone or white balance as this camera photo looks better than the auto settings in Lightroom on most, not all, occasions. Have yet to try the video side and actually didn't buy it for the video and would have personally preferred it being a camera only with more features. But maybe I will say to myself why not mix in some video which I failed to do and was highly upset after shooting a waterfall. A 2 mintue video snip would have fit perfectly embedded within a slide show. But I was not hiking back just for video. I say buy.""
"20120329","5.0","A Fantastic Tool For A Creative Artist","This is a simple review and the D5100 is simply amazing! I visited many stores to try different brands and models, including its closest competitor Canon Rebel T3i. I also borrowed from friends to try as well. In the end, D5100 was the winner based on my hands-on experience. You probably have read numerous reviews and got more confused. I was one of you. My advice: visit a store and try cameras yourself.I like the way D5100 fits in my hands (good ergonomics); it is lighter and smaller to carry around (in comparison with other DSLRs); though it is made of plastic (most entry- and mid- level DSLRs are) yet very solid and well- built; its shutter sound is music to my ear; its menu is instinctive and thus easy to get used to; the swivel 3' LCD screen is very convenient; its battery life is relatively long, especially if you use viewfinder instead of live-view most of the time (you should try to do so, as most pros do); its auto-focus is swift and accurate, no 'hunting' most of the time; it takes sharp and beautiful pictures, thanks to its newly updated software and hardware; lastly, I like the silver shutter button (I am vain)!However, if you have a smaller budget, the D3100 is the next best thing, and it produce wonderful pictures, too. If you can afford, of course get the D7000 with more buttons to play with and a heavier body to carry around, though the picture quality is about the same as D5100 (same sensor and pixel count) in most shooting conditions.In addition, the kit lens (18mm - 55mm) it comes with is surprisingly good and sharp (tested by 'professionals'), which means that you don't need to upgrade your lens gears right away until you are ready to (or your finance allows you to). Believe me, the camera body may become the cheapest asset once you get into serious photography. The lenses are expensive, but they do keep their values. On the other hand, camera body, like cars, depreciates.I am not bias towards Nikon and against others. In fact, I have Sony and Canon, and still own 35mm film Nikon and Pentax. From my experience, D5100 is the best in its class that fits all my needs and most requirements. At the beginning of my search, I charted pros and cons of all possible candidates and ended without conclusions. Then, I realized that, just like buying a car, I needed to 'test drive' the cameras also! After all, buying a DSLR is not an easy decision, because it is not a cheap toy (for me anyway) and may accompany for years to come.Furthermore, D5100 can dress-up or dress-down. For a professional, it offers most functions (and some more) that you can fine tune and adjust. However, if you just want an upgrade from a point-n-shoot, it has AUTO and SCENES that you don't need to fiddle anything yet take amazing pictures. Just practice and familiarize with the camera's buttons and functions, you will be very happy with it.Remember, a camera is only a tool. YOU, the photographer, are the one that takes good (or bad) pictures, not the camera. In this modern era, most DSLRs are capable of producing sharp and colorful pictures. The pixel counts, sensors, noises, abrasions, or distortions, etc. can be meaningless, if you don't know how to take good pictures. My conclusion: D5100 is an excellent tool to practice and explore your artistic skills.""

"20120307","5.0","Great Nikon Camera!","Previous Nikon Coolpix cameras such as their 8800 & 8400,8 meg cameras (5 years ago) really gave me such options and picture quality I never thought I would need to invest into a DSLR.  However, recent 'ProCam' purchases including the Nikon P100 and Sony DXC-HX9 or the earlier HX5 while having some rather cool options, really no longer had as good quality images.  Their backgrounds were watercolor washy and well...just weren't as professional as they should have been with the growth in digital imagery. In addition, features have been eliminated on the 'ProCam's' such as hot-shoe flash, ability to use filters, RAW or Extra-high JPEG file saving to name a few .Purchased the D5100 with 18mm -55mm and the 55mm to 300mm.  Wow, just what I was looking for.  Sharp and explicit detail and low, low noise infraction at higher ISO.  Shooting at 1600 and totally amazed at the quality.  I'm not going to pick it apart for there are many other long reviews to read here and else where.Just to mention a few of the items I'm so glad to have back by going to a DSLR at this time.  BIG LIKE is the fully swivel LCD screen in all directions, hot shoe, filters, RAW and TTL flash (Nikon SB-800) a rather light & small footprint in my camera bag.  Extremely high useable ISO settings, the ability to use a wireless remote or wired remote shutter release.

"20120225","5.0","Incredible value in DSLR system photography","I won't go into details about the merits of the Nikon D5100.  Others have described the camera's capabilities in depth and with thought and passion.  Simply put, it is an outstanding camera capable of serving the needs of every amateur photographer. Yes, it is that good. The biggest practical difference between the D5100 and the less expensive D3100 is video capability.  If you are not interested in HDvideo, the D3100 is a better value. For normal use, it is impossible to tell the difference between an image made with either camera.  The D5100 does offer a bit better low light performance.  However it will not benefit most amateur users that much, if at all. That said, either Nikon is superior to any Canon DSLR for flash photography.  Nikon's iTTL flash system is better at metering and producing properly exposed images than anything Canon offers, regardless of price.  In fact, Nikon's TTL system from 20 years ago is better than anything Canon offers today.  If you NEVER use flash, Canon is a wonderful choice.  Canon cameras offer rich, saturated colors.  All my compact digital cameras are made by Canon, including the wonderful S95.  I am not a anti-Canon Nikon fan.  I do use Nikon SLR film and digital SLR cameras.  Many choose to minimize the benefits of the Nikon flash system.  Don't choose a camera system without considering it.  Nikon makes the best flash system. Period.For those that want to compare the D5100 to the D7000.  Don't.  The D7000 exceeds the needs of nearly every amateur.  Its biggest practical difference for most users is compatibility with Nikon Ais and AF lenses made since 1977.  Unless you already own older Nikkor lenses or plan on buying them now, the AFS lenses made today will more than meet your needs.  Too many people buy DSLRs for ego.  Don't be one of them.  Buy a Nikon DSLR that works with your budget and immediately buy a separate flash, such as the capable and inexpensive Nikon SB-400, and learn and enjoy photography.  Only you can make good photographs.  The camera has very little to do with it.  Don't believe anyone that tells you otherwise.  Professionals have far different needs than you and me.  I have a Nikon D200, a Nikon 8008, and a Nikkormat FTn.  I have been using an slr for 37 years, ever since I was twelve. You will not go wrong with the D3100 or the D5100. And remember, only buy a Nikon flash.""

"20120220","5.0","Great camera at a great price","I have been a member of the Nikon family for over 30 years, initially with film cameras. My first digital was a d60 in 2008, then I moved to a d3100 in 2010. I was very pleased with that but wanted to move up to a higher level product at a reasonable price level. I read all the reviews (including ones for other manufacturers' cameras) but in the end it was clear to me: the d5100 had everything I wanted and needed for the level of photography that I'm at and where I am likely to remain (by choice). I don't earn my living with photography, but do consider myself an advanced hobbyist who really enjoys taking pictures of people, events and landscapes for my own amusement and my friends' amazement. The d5100 does all that and more for a great price.In particular, what I like about it includes the better (than the d3100) sensor, the additional shooting modes that really increase my capacity to create great pictures, the easy-to-use controls, the ability to use an infra-red remote (that should have been on the d3100), and the light weight. I use three lenses: the kit 18-55mm, the fixed f1.8 35mm, and the heavier 70-300mm zoom, which do a great job on sharpness and clarity of the images.Since I moved from a d3100 it did not take long to know how to use the d5100. For me, shooting in the P mode generally works the best, and I mostly use matrix metering and AF-A mode. The built-in flash is good but I prefer to use the very capable but (relatively) inexpensive SB-400 external flash unit. Auto ISO also works well for me, although I do play with it sometimes but find it's best not to go over 3200.While I am aware of the old and true saying that people take pictures, not cameras, I would add to that that having a wonderful camera with the features of the d5100 really helps this particular person take great pictures!I am very pleased with the d5100 which combines an excellent mix of reasonable cost, ease of use, and very high quality images.""
"20120216","1.0","Nikon's Abysmal QC","So here are the two shots that I used to test the D5100s:1) One shot, 30 sec long w/ cap on to find hot pixels.2) One shot, 2.5sec, f/36, 200mm, out of focus, laptop screen as target (Empty Word Document). Shot auto-toned in Photoshop to see dead pixels and dust.The units tested and results:1) From a well known brick store that turned into online store (refurbished kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots + hot pixels on sensor.2) From a well known and very respected brick store's website (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots + hot pixels on sensor.3) Replacement from above store's website (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots on sensor + hot pixels on sensor.4) Local mom-and-pop, very respected store, tested by their tech. (new D5100): Dust spots on sensor + dead pixels on sensor.5) Local electronics store chain (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots on sensor.(Serial 3256xxx)6) Replacement from above chain store (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots on sensor + dead pixels on sensor.(Serial 3255xxx)7) From a very very well known website (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots on sensor + dead pixels on sensor.8) One more unit from chain in (5) (6) (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots on sensor + hot pixel on sensor. (Serial 32555806)9) Exchange from chain checked in store (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): hot pixel on sensor visible on LCD (w/ cap on). (Serial 3253032)10) Exchange from chain checked in store (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): hot pixel on sensor visible on LCD (w/ cap on). (Serial 3251783)11) One more unit from brick store of (1) that I showed to the salesperson (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): hot pixel on sensor visible on LCD (w/ cap on). (Serial 327xxxx)12) Instant exchange of the one in (11) (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots on sensor + no hot pixels on sensor visible on LCD (w/ cap on). (Serial 328xxxx)All units had shutter-counts below 20 when I got them, all except one (the body only in '4') used the lenses that came in the kit and none showed improvement by using built-in sensor dust cleaner and the 'Rocket Blower'. Total indoor envirnoment for the first two shots was less than 20 seconds taken in connecting the body to the lens (camera body pointing down and lens back pointing up).Should I say more, are they moving these cameras without QC at all. Even if I discount for dust itself, I mean how much time does it realistically take to do a pixel remap for dead/hot pixels at QC when the item will take more time, effort, money and reputation later. If these are 'test escapes' then that means that these units went out without 'burn-in' which means that more dead/hot pixels will show up as the unit ages.This dust could actually be oil splatters (like in D7000 issues) and perhaps that is why it does not respond to built in dust-cleaner and 'rocket blower'... Either way Nikon should do something about their QC on this model...-P.S.-I tested the unit in (12) for hot pixels at ISO 100/2000/6000 and found 3 hot pixels in 6000, 1 in 2000 (not the saem as in 6000) and none in 100. This is the best unit thus far so I took it to shop mentioned in (4) for cleaning and for $35 they removed 6 out of the 8 stuborn (which do not respond to 'rocket blower') dust spots. I think I will call it a day here and keep this unit hoping that it does not 'grow' any dead pixels.I called Nikon and found them to be polite but un-appologetic about the whole issue. They offered free shipping on a D5100 from their website and retro-actively pay for return if the unit was found w/ dead/hot pixels or dust on sensor. Good call but I decided to go with a local shop to ensure quick turn around, especially if its the exact same price (price + tax + no shipping).I am holding my 1/5 stars because 1/12 is not the best score for a new product...""
"20120215","4.0","Nice DSLR with a few trade offs","Having my 4 year old Canon XSi and lenses stolen, I was faced with a dilemma in picking a replacement.  I've always used Canon equipment since my high school days MANY moons ago, starting with the Canon A1. I read through the reviews of the latest Canon Rebel T3i and the Nikon D5100.  With a tight budget, and wanting to check 'the other side', I decided on a refurbished D5100 package with the 18-55 and 55-200mm Nikkor lens kit.The other reviews here go into a great deal of detail, so I won't repeat.  They are mostly accurate.  As a Canon owner and devotee, my short summary is this:1. The Canon T3i is built a bit better a bit less flimsy and feels more 'Pro', but the Nikon D5100 is lighter and a little easier to carry around.  The Nikon Quality is good, but a little more 'Consumer' feeling.2. There is no extended grip/battery attachment from Nikon.  Some third party grips are available, but they require an external cable to link the grip to the camera, in order to use the optional release button on the grip.  Not a show stopper, but a bit annoying if you want to put a more 'Pro' package together.3. As many of the reviews point out, their is no dedicated ISO selector, you have to go into the menus.  However, you can assign ISO functions to a customizable function button on the front of the camera near the left grip.  I did not find this to be a big deal.4. I found the menus and options, along with the large bright LCD display to be very user friendly.  There is built in help for just about every option, and the graphic display is informative and helpful.5. The end result, the photos, I found to be extremely nice.  It is subjective, but I feel the resulting images are a tick above the Canon, especially at low ISO settings.  I have a Schnauzer with a very dark coat, and had a terrible time getting good shots of her indoors with the Canon.  The Nikon gave me great photos of her out of the box in full auto mode.  I was impressed.Conclusion:I really like the Nikon, and believe that for the average hobbyist photographer it will take great photos.  I personally like the resulting images a little better then those of my Canon, and I found the camera a little easier to use out of the box.  I like the fact that it is lighter and more compact then the Canon.  On the other hand, the Canon is built a bit better, has easier access to more advanced settings, and is a little more professional when expanding with an battery/grip and remote flash control.  The Nikon can be had for $100 to $250 less for an equivalent package to the Canon T3i.  I would say for your average hobbyist/non-Pro user the Nikon is an overall great value and will get you better photos with less effort.  The Canon is no slouch, but is aimed at a user that wants to tweak things more on a more regular basis and for those that may require a slightly more durable piece of hardware.""
"20120213","5.0","Wow! What a step up...","...from a Canon PowerShot.This is the first DSLR I've bought, and considering the lens the camera came with, I could not be happier. As an amateur just beginning to get into photography for eventual professional use, this camera boasts everything I've ever wanted but never found in cheaper digital cameras targeted at the average consumer. Primarily: incredibly fast snapping speed (especially compared against those cheaper digital cameras I was talking about... which take forever for every picture :/), and an incredibly intuitive interface for configuring everything.I remember I had a real headache just trying to just change ISO settings on an old Canon PowerShot. I don't think I was even able to change shutter speed, much less manually focus the camera - but of course, all of these things that I've wanted to experiment with for years are now finally a snap with this camera. Consequently, every picture I take with this camera is eons ahead of anything any auto-focus camera I've used has ever been able to offer.On a related note, the fact that you also get a heads up within the viewfinder about shutter speed, etc. - is awesome!But if that's all I was looking for, I would've opted for a cheaper D3100. What really differentiated the D5100 was the additional abilitiy to capture full 1080p video. While I'm not aiming to create a film with this camera, I'd recently begun hunting for a cheap digital camcorder to use for motion capture for animation references. The fact that the D5100 was a step-up from the D3100 at the same cost of any decent camcorder sold me on the spot.On a sidenote: I am thoroughly satisfied with the lens the camera comes with, but I'm already beginning to see what other sorts of lenses I want to explore and use. I'm glad the price-point didn't hit the one-thousand-wall because now I have more money to put into lenses later down the line.Since I lack the experience to proffer a more technical review of the camera, let me make my concluding remarks: I am completely satisfied with my purchase and entry into the world of DSLRs. I don't see myself ever turning back, and I can foresee myself using this camera alone for at least several years. While the key distinguishing feature for the D5100 vs. the 3100 was the video capture (the MP increase isn't necessary for my needs), I doubt that's the case for everyone. If you're looking to purchase your first DSLR, not looking for video capture, and the increased megapixel count isn't necessary, I recommend you check out other reviews that make more point-by-point comparisons between the D5100 and D3100 to see if you might be able to save some money. Save it so you can put it into buying lenses, of course.""

This camera literally can shoot in the dark. I stuck my 18-200 lens through my blinds in my back yard, and took a picture of the shed out there. No porch light, just the ambient light from the city around it. I was in night-vision effect mode, and the pic was black and white, and noisy as heck, but wow! I could actually make out what I shot! My poor old D80 would NEVER have picked that up! The continuous shooting mode is faster than fast, the video (which I'll likely seldom use) is sharp, and the most important feature? Well, kiddos, to me that's picture quality, and it blows the doors off of my previous camera. I'm really looking forward to putting this little gem through it's paces in the next few weeks! I'll be out shooting at a nature preserve, at the local park hunting for squirrels, and just here and there annoying everyone with it! I can't wait. This new toy has made me excited about photography again!The good:Great menu system. Big improvement!Smaller/lighter than the D80 (Fits into my slimline bag better)Picture quality is outstandingFaster responseVideoTons of new features to play withCool special effects modesThe bad:I have to manual focus some of my older lensesIt's smaller, which means I have to adjust to how it feels in my handsslight learning curve (But I'll get over it)I have to go buy some bigger SD cards if I want to take pics in full res with RAW, or I'll be filling up a LOT faster (OK, not really a bad, but still...)Conclusion: I'm not looking back! This is a GREAT camera and a HUGE improvement over my old body! Great work Nikon!""

I planned to buy a battery grip but the depth of the camera was a problem along with its height. I highly recommend holding the D5100 before making your purchase.""
"20120202","5.0","A Nikon Success","This Nikon d5100 does exactly what it says on the box, I am not a photographic genius, but if you take time to read all the instuctions, which are set out in a easy to understand manner, you will soon be able to take in my view great pictures.  The camera comes with all the leads, chargers, nessessary to take instant pictures, with one exception it does not come with a basic memory card without which you cannot use the camera!Apart from that another great NIKON this is my 3rd,the other two being 35mm. I would say this mid priced camera is ideal for people like me who like to take good pictures,but are not camera buffs!""

Even in low lighting environment. Have not had time to explore more features.Afterward, I did more research and found out that I could have just bought a body and buy a 18 - 300mm or 200mm lens.It seems to be the trend to have one lens for all situations rather than carry two lens.Overall, I am very satisfied.""
"20120201","1.0","Serious Problems with Nikon warranty","Listen, this is an expensive piece of equipment. So before you buy it, understand that there is a fair probability that your equipment will be defective. For example this camera is known to come with a sensor defect. With most companies this is not a problem, because if a product is defective, companies that care about their reputation and brand name will stand by their products and cover any factory defects under their warranty. Nikon claims to offer a 1-yr. warranty. But if your equipment is defective, they'll ask you to send it in (at your expense) to be checked. Once they have it, they'll tell you the problem is not covered under warranty and charge you a small fee to fix it and send it back. Once you approve this charge, they'll write back to tell you they re-inspected the problem and it will cost almost as much as the camera to fix.It is a nice camera, but can you afford to be the one stuck with the 1 out 100 cameras that have the sensor problem?""
"20120201","4.0","This is a great little camera","This camera doesn't replace my Nikon D90 (I actually have 2 of them and love them) - but it is a great 'smaller' camera to cart around when I don't want to lug the D90.  It isn't much smaller - but it is a little lighter and smaller.  I haven't tried all the features yet - but I have been very pleased so far.  The picture quality is great.  I would have rated it 4.5 but I couldn't give a half star.  The thing that drives me crazy is that in order to see a photo that I just shot - I need to have the flip screen open.  This annoys me because with the D90 - I just look down and see it.  The flip screen is taking some getting used to.  However, having a swivel LCD screen also has benefits.  I purchased the D5100 because it is rated very high when compared to the Nikon D7000.  I wanted the D7000 but it is currently more than I am willing to pay.  The D5100 gives me the higher megapixels, etc. that the D90 doesn't have and better and more user-friendly video recording (I don't use the video features often).  This will be my 'travel' camera.  I am going to Bermuda in the spring and will be giving the D5100 a workout there.  I only used the kit lens a couple time.  I have placed my Sigma 18-200mm lens on this camera.  I like that it uses the same lenses that I have for my D90.UPDATE: I have to take back what I said about being annoyed by the swivel/flip screen - the camera is fairly new to me (and none of my other dSLRs ever had a flip screen), and I did not know that you were able to flip and turn it so you could snap it in backward so you could see it.  Thanks to the reader below - I tried again.  I had not tried that particular twist and flip sequence before. I still would rate the camera a 4.5.""

But when I started seeing eagles, I had to upgrade. I got this camera. It is awesome. It has all the bells and whistles --more than I could ever imagine---and I am learning how to use it. It is like a merecedes. You can take pictures right out of the box with the automatic settings - but I am looking forward to learning about my D5100. It is the start of a long and beautiful relationship.""
"20120116","5.0","Great Camera","I love this camera. The image quality is fantastic. It is easy enough to use for a beginner, and has enough features to please an avid photographer. The flip out screen is fantastic and makes getting the right shot simple. I take my camera everywhere I go and have captured some amazing moments. I have had this camera for about a year now and have had no problems with it.  If you are interested in purchasing your first DSLR, this product it the best choice. If you just need to update an old DSLR, this product should be on the top of your list. I would definately recommend this camera to others. As a matter of fact, I have on several occasions. Friends of mine have thanked me for the advice, and they are also very pleased with their purchase.""
"20120113","5.0","Excellent Basic DSLR","I bought the D5100 with two Nikon lenses (18-55 and 55-250 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom lens). I should say the camera has been extremely satisfactory. I am new graduate from the point and shoot Canon S 120. Though I was thinking of Canon cameras, I went with my friend's recommendation. I am totally grateful to him. The layout is pretty user friendly and flip LCD screen works pretty good. Low Light pictures comes out good. I am more of a landscape photographer and am loving the 55-250 lens. The lens also comes useful for on Stage events. A definite recommendation to all those enthusiasts who want to learn photography and all its beautiful intricacies. One suggestion though, sign up for a photography class to fully enjoy the camera's various modes.""
"20120112","5.0","Plug and Play...","Folks,You can leave this on the AUTO setting, and the pictures look great. I either leave it on this setting or put it on the P setting, and leave the settings at: White Balance: Auto > OK > A2; Set Picture Control: SD > OK > Sharpening: 7, Saturation: +1; Active D-Lighting: Extra High. Leave everything else as default/AUTO. These settings seem to beat the AUTO settings, especially when taking lower light/indoor photos. This could simply be a personal preference, though. Sometimes also putting on HDR (settings: default), on top of what I've set above also helps when you notice very high light-dark (light contrast) shots in front of you.The only issue I see is that this camera tends to massively increase the ISO (1500-3000+) in slightly lower lighting conditions, when it is not needing to do so. Put it on P (or M, A, S),and the camera does not reach for those crazy-high ISO settings; you can bound the ISO Auto setting's lowest & highest numbers.Also, I have seen no/extremely little noise, with photos, even when I magnify them, when the ISO is upwards of 800-1000 levels; you get above these levels, and you begin to see increasing levels of noise, but only if you crop/magnify the picture 150%+.The only complaints I have are that it eats through the battery charge, even when not in live mode, and, if you want (and should) buy a secondary battery, they are very expensive!Great camera!MarcP.S. Folks, what P (or M, A, S) settings do you like?""
"20120112","5.0","Why I picked the D5100 over the D3100","I returned my D3100 for this one.  Why?  The D3100 was a great, inexpensive camera that took wonderful pictures.  But I soon realized it lacked some features I truly wanted.  The main feature I wanted that the D3100 lacked, was bracketing, so I can use the Photomatix program more easily to do HDR photography.  It was well worth a few hundred bucks more, for me.  The rest of it is just gravy, but I also like the added tilt/swivel display, infrared sensors for the remote control, and the in-camera high dynamic range photography.  I also prefer how the controls are laid out, and the extra weight gives the camera a beefier feel.""

My heart stopped.It's perfectly fine. No problems. Checked the lens, checked every setting, checked the screen, buttons, not even a scratch.This is a good semi professional camera to add to your gift list for that person who has butter fingers like myself. &lt;3Oh... did I forget to mention it takes outstanding photos.

"20120104","5.0","Great Camera","I'm just a weekend/vacation (at best) photographer. I don't need overly complex. I don't want too simple. So, the D5100 with much of what makes the D7000 such a stunning performer, but with less fuss over settings, is absolutely perfect for me. I did buy the kit and I had gotten the 55-200 MV VR lense with the D3100. While the lense is certainly up to most challenges, I will at some point upgrade to better glass as I've always believed nothing can be better than the weakest link. Still, the pictures these lenses are producing are simply stunning.HDR is good. It's not quite as significant as the manual suggests (you have to push exposure over and under to get maximum results), but I didn't buy the camera for HDR to begin with. I'm also not a big videographer, but have taken a few videos and was pleasantly surprised at the quality. Autofocus works a bit slow in lower light, but in bright light, my videos were nice and in-focus. I did buy a really good Sandisk 16 GB Class 10 card, so I suspect it helps as well.Setting up the camera is simple and straight forward. I didn't even have to read the manual in much detail, except to get a few refence points. I do recommend downloading the fuller PDF user guide suppled with the camera, as it provides more information than the book in the box.""

"20120101","5.0","Great step up from my D40x","I bought this to replace my D40x after the flash quit working (though I still have it as a backup).  I had a few issues with the D40x, but I am extremely pleased with the D5100.  There are only a few minor complaints I have, which I will detail below.  I have only had it for about a week now but I think I made a great choice.  I would consider myself a moderately skilled amateur but have absolutely no desire for anything bigger and better!Pros:- The colors captured on this camera are leaps and bounds better than my D40x.  I put them on the same tripod and took the same picture using full auto mode.  Everything on my D40x had a reddish tint and the colors were not quite true.  The colors from the D5100 were simply stunning and were considerably more accurate.- There are 23 different levels of ISO sensitivity (my D40x had 6), and the pictures are considerably less noisy, even at higher ISOs.  I used the same lens/shutter speed/aperture/tripod for both cameras and shot each one at 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 3200 using my remote.  The picture from the D5100 seems less noisy at 3200 than what the D40x produced at 800.  Anything higher than 3200 seems to produce some fairly considerable noise however, especially if cropped.- Continuous mode is finally continuous!  Using the same SD card in both cameras (16GB class 10) I attempted continuous mode.  The D40x will take 3 frames per second, but only for the first second.  By then the buffer is full and the speed is drastically reduced.  The D5100 shoots 4 frames per second and takes at least 17 photos before any buffering is required.  In theory this means that you have 4 full seconds of shooting before any buffering occurs but I have never once filled the buffer (though I never tried to deliberately do so either).- I didn't purchase this with the intention of taking many videos, but after viewing a test video on my computer I was extremely pleased with the quality.  The video is very sharp and the file size is very reasonable (was about 30MB for a ~30 second clip...or roughly 1MB/second at 1920x1080 and 30FPS).  Note that the audio is monaural however.  If you want to use this for more professional videos then you'll probably need to purchase the external mic for stereo sound (which is quite expensive in my opinion).  This may eventually replace my dedicated video camera, though further testing and a telephoto lens will almost certainly be required.- Live mode finally works, if you prefer using that (note: live mode *must* be enabled to shoot video).- 11 auto focus points instead of only 3.  This is great if you're using a tripod and can't really recompose shots.Cons:- The biggest annoyance I have with this camera is that it does not show up as a USB drive when plugged into a computer.  It will still show up as an import source in some photography software (Aperture, iPhoto, etc.) though I have found the easiest thing to do is to insert the SD card into my SD to USB converter.  Using my converter it will show up just like a mass storage drive and I can browse the files and pull the pictures and movies directly.  Otherwise one must install Nikon's software just to import the files (which seems like a pain, plus I'll soon be running nothing but Linux which isn't supported).- Aperture 2.0 does not recognize the movies files so it cannot import them.  I don't have Aperture 3.0 so I can't speak for that, and I have no experience with Lightroom or Bibble 5.- Aperture 2.0 cannot read the new 14-bit RAW files that this camera generates (though it would read the 12-bit RAW files from my D40x).  I ultimately decided not to shoot in RAW anyway, but it's sort of a bummer that it doesn't support it as Aperture offers more editing options for RAW files.  Again, I cannot comment on how well any other software handles these files.Other thoughts:- I haven't had any issues with image sharpness.  Whether I use the 18-55mm VR lens or my 35mm f/1.8 lens (which I HIGHLY recommend), my pictures come out perfectly crisp and sharp.- It has not suddenly stopped taking pictures, though I did purchase an extended warranty (parts and labor) for it.  I now have 4 years of protection instead of just 1.- There is no auto-focus motor on the body of this camera so make sure to purchase a AF-I or AF-S lenses.  The older AF lenses will still work with this camera but you will have to manually focus every shot.- My 16GB card will hold roughly 1600 photos using JPEG (Fine) format.""
"20111231","5.0","Outstanding PRO-sumer Level DSLR!","I was a complete novice to DSLR technology when I purchased the D5100.  But after EXTENSIVE research through many websites including [...], I decided to go with the D5100.  WOW! I couldn't have done better for the money! This camera produces awesome pictures. The battery lasts a very long time. The multiple exposures speed is very quick for this level of model.  My ONLY change to this model would be to add the Auto Focus motor to drive the AF on non AF-S lenses.  I know the D7000 can do this with the same sensor.  I just couldn't spend the extra $$$ at the time.I was convinced to enter a few of my early pictures into a local photo contest.  To my disbelief, I took first and second place!Buy this camera, you won't be disappointed!

"20111230","4.0","Firmware Bug! - Easy to fix","We just bought this camera, but it turns out there is a bug in the software. Specifically, certain SD cards cannot be used. After talking with their tech support, it appears to be the SanDisk Ultimate/Extreme cards. The other brands, and older cards work fine.You can find the firmware fix by googling 'D5100 firmware upgrade'.  It'll be one of the top results from Nikon Support.Unfortunately, you need a SD card that works to upload the firmware, so if you buy this camera from Amazon, buy a SD card from another manufacturer than SanDisk.We finally were able to install the firmware patch, and the camera works great with all of the SD cards including SanDisk.So, in review, there is a bug with the camera preventing it from using certain SD cards.  It can be fixed relatively easy, but you just need an old SD card to make it work.""

I know they both make amazing camera and lenses. i did go to the store to see how they each felt. When i did that they both were very similar (5100 vs canon t3i). so i went with the nikon based on the fact that it seems to take better photos through the research i have done. Although the canon is known to have better video mode so it a better all around camera. i highly recommend this camera to anyone wanting to get into photography and take amazing photos!""
