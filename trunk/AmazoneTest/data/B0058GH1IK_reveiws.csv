Not until a couple of weeks ago, the card went from a Class 10 to a Class 2. Transfer rates just progressively kept getting slower. Never had I rough housed the card or put it through any physical harm. Last night, I did an event for a night club. I guess it was too much for the SD card. I took 500+ pictures in the course of 6 hours and by the end of the night, the card was done. The malfunction caused my camera to shut down. At first, I thought it was camera so I let it sit for a while, replaced the battery but when I got home and tried to upload the pictures, my computer wouldn't read the card. I tried other computers, other cameras. No joy. I tried to use data recovery software but there's no point if the computer doesn't even know the card is there.

"20120310","4.0","Solid, Not Expensive ... Save the card as 'original negatives'","I bought two of these for a vacation trip, and am very pleased.Do not really need the class-10 speed (which apparently this card barely meets) as I do not shoot hi-def video.That being said, SDHC cards such as this one are now cheap enough that I simply treat them as I would treat film negatives and file them away after use as (yet another) backup of the files.As far as reliability, I have had cards from Canon, SanDisk, Kingston, Transcend ... and even the classic 'No Name' fail at one time or another generally just after starting to use.My impression is that SanDisk (which, along with Toshiba invented the Secure Digital Memory Card) is the most reliable, and Kingston the least - but that is just my impression.All SD cards have high 'infant mortality,' and who knows which company actually fabs the AmazonBasics card?Most of the failures I have had were within the first few uses of a card. When I get any SD card these days, I use it for several weeks before putting any trust in it. So far have had only five late (more than 1 year old) failures: Canon 32GB, Kingston 4 & 16GB, Transcend 8, 16 & 32GB. I have not yet had a SanDisk fail after the first couple of months of use - though I am sure that this will happen.The higher capacity cards seem more prone to failure, so at the moment I generally am only using 4 & 8GB cards.I also like the Amazon packaging: It is easy to open, and uses recycled materials.""

I have had nothing but struggles with these cards since I have put them in my cameras.  I constantly get 'corrupted data' warnings on my Nikon, especially when I shoot video.I lost a bunch of pictures of my newborn taken on my Fuji and the card just didn't write.Also, I don't know about the class 10 speed.  My cameras often slow down when using these cards, which they don't do when using my Scandisk cards of similar size and speed.In my opinion, the Amazon basics SDHC Class 10 cards are junk and it's worth a bit more money to keep your pictures and videos safe.""
"20120307","4.0","Solid class 10 performance.","I've bought 3 of these cards so far, all 32 GB, 1 late 2011 and another 2 in March 2012. There are some small markings on them that are very different (i.e. different font, number of characters, etc). That lead me to believe they came from different batches, possibly different manufactures. But testing them all with h2testw showed no errors on any of them, and at least 10MB/s write and 18 MB/s read speed on all 3 of them.The one purchased in 2011 has been heavily used, hundreds of photos written to it by the camera in day, go home to read and delete the files with a pc (build in SD card reader), reformat the card with the camera and start again the next day, this has been repeated on the card dozens of times. And I have never seen an error.  The two new one have been used like this several times now, no issues.When I tested speeds, I found that the older one actually tested nearly 15 MBytes/s write and 19 MBytes's read, the two new ones both showed results of slightly more than 10MBytes/s write and 18 MBytes/s read. By comparison, I have a Sandisk 32GB class 2 card that tested with 5.8 MBytes/s write and 9.6 MBytes/s read, and a Sandisk 32 GB Extreme Pro (labeled 45MB/s) with 26.8 MBytes/s and 37.3 MBytes/s read (but of course, that card costs 3 times as much).Using these cards with a new Sony DSLR with a 24 mega pixel capable of capturing 10-12 frames per second, I actually see little different in these cards and the much more expensive Sandisk, maybe there's an extra frame or two before the buffer is full in each burst, and several seconds less waiting for the buffer to clear, but I've never bothered to test that.""

Bought two of these, one for a spare in case a second card was needed. May use the second one in the digital player while waiting for the time I need more memory in the camera.

It's never happened to me before.In case you were wondering, Amazon Basics does not have the ability to help retrieve lost data on the card as of 1.31.12.

"20120131","5.0","Does as advertised","'Class 10' is a term indicating that the read/write speeds of a card is more than 10mb per second. In real-world tests, I've consistently gotten 12-15 mb/s on large file transfers, and 9-10 mb/s on transfers of multiple small files. Unfortunately, you can't put this SD card in the same league as the high end class 10 cards that hit 25+ mb/s, but unless you are recording HD video or some other intensive data reading/writing, speeds beyond this class 10 card aren't really necessary.I have been using this SD card for video recording, file transfers, file storage, and whatever else I have been able to throw at it, and have not run into issues. Devices I have used this on so far is my Windows PC, Android Tablet, and Digital Camera.There have been no issues with corruption or anything of the sort, but will update if problems arise.""
"20120128","5.0","Great Deal, Works Great","I ordered this card to go along with my new Canon PowerShot A3300IS. It works just fine, has about 14.8 GB of space after formatting. It handles every function of the camera perfectly. I also used this card in my Kodak ZD8612IS, and can't tell any difference from the old 8 GB class 4 card, other than increased reading time before it's ready to take a picture. I thought the faster speed card would allow me to take more pictures in burst mode before the camera has to stop and process, but it's exactly the same as the old class 4 card. Just for the heck of it, I popped it into my brother's Canon Vixia to see if it would work better than our class 4 cards, but there's no practical difference. I think the only way you would see an immediate benefit of a class 10 card would be if you had a modern, hi-end DSLR with a fast burst mode and processor. I would still definitely recommend this card to anyone looking for a 16 GB card, regardless of their class needs. I don't see where having unused speed capability is a bad thing. Even if you buy it for a less demanding device you'll know it is good to go if you ever get something more powerful later.Pros:Great value.Works perfectly.Cons:None.""

Unfortunately it did not work in my canon vixia f100.I placed it into my camcorder and formatted the card.  During my first attempt at recording I recieved an error message indicating that the card was noy fast enough to record at the speed/quality that I have been using for the past 4 years using a 4 year old class 6 Patriot SDHC.  Already dissappointed I decreased the quality settings to the equivilant of 720p and the card worked, or at least so I thought....After recording about 90 min of my daughter's birthday party, I tried to play back the video and got nothing but black videos.  No sound - nothing.  I even tried the SDHC in a memory card reader and was able to transfer these dark, soundless videos for play on my PC.  Moments like those cannot be replaced and I cannot do a retake.  Needless to say I was upset.I learned my lesson since I should have done more thorough tests on the card prior to use.  I usually do but the other reviews here were so positive that I neglected due diligence.I summary, this card should have performed at least on par with a 4 year old class 6 SDHC card. Instead it failed to record at 1080p and when it recorded at 720p it produced black videos with no sound using my canon vixia f100.  I only gave it 2 stars because I did not try it in other devices.""

Shooting video with this was not an option - after a about 10-15 seconds of shooting, video would automatically stop.  Reading in the camera's manual about the issue let us know this was more than likely an issue with the above mentioned write speed.  We tested video shooting with the SD card that came with the camera itself, and it worked just fine.  So, it is nice for picture taking, not nice for video.  Can't complain about free though.""

"20111225","4.0","Fast, great item for the $","I thought I would give amazon basics a try, knowing that if the item didn't work as expected, it's be easy to deal with Amazon to get a refund.  However, I am pleased to say that I have used this card in the 2 cameras that I wanted it for, and with my computer, and it has worked flawlessly.  It also writes quickly.  I recommend giving this Amazon Basics card a try at a price that's hard to find with other companies.""
"20111224","3.0","Slower write speed","Used the Flash Memory Toolkit to test the speed of the card. compared Sandisk 4GB class 4 vs Amazon 16GB class 10.Sandisk has a consistent write speed of at least 4GB no matter the file size, read @6MB/Sec. Amazon has a varying write speed depending on the file size. For file size 1~5MB the write speed is between 1~3MB/Sec.Has a very good read speed of 18~19MB/Sec.""
"20111223","5.0","Some issues when mounting it, but the price was right","I got the 16GB class 10 version of this card for free (had to pay for shipping) as part of a promotion on the Nikon 1 J1. Packaging was adequate and minimalistic: a white cardboard envelope, the card was shipped in a plastic case and with an information sheet, that was the extent of the packaging.The card gave me some weird mounting errors the first time that I inserted it in the Nikon 1 J1 and in the SD reader built into my Dell Latitude E6400 (Windows 7/64). Except for those two incidents the card has been working perfectly. I have shot a lot of RAW plus 1080p30 movies and some slow motion clips without issues.I haven't tried to measure read/write performance, but from a completely subjective point of view I have yet to feel that the card is slowing me down, so for now I believe that the card at the very least meets the class 10 minimums.For the $3.99 I paid to ship the 'free' card it was one hell of a deal (my previous card was a microSD 8GB class 6 card that cost me $22 or so a year ago). I will probably pick a second card for paranoia mitigation.""

"20111221","5.0","Its Cheap and It Works Well","For me, the best review, is a review from someone who has the same devices (expensive toys) that I have.

This is a great SDHC Card for you.And if you want to have multiple cards, so you can continue taking pictures while uploading pictures / video, then this is the card for you.  It is fast (Class 10), cheap under $20, and 16GB gives me almost 2000 shots at 14Mega pixels RAW format.

"20111109","5.0","Works well for my camera","My camera uses SD cards and the duration of continuous shooting (i.e. the number of photos at the shortest interval, fastest speed) is highly dependent on the speed of the SD disk I use.  The disk is responsible for clearing the on-camera cache of my dSLR, and my experience with cards like SanDisks Class 10 cards is that they allow me to take a nearly continuous stream of raw, 14 MP images without overloading the cache and write speed of the camera.However, the class ratings of SD cards is something that is known to vary despite the attempt at keeping the class weight ratings.  This is often related to differences in write vs. read capabilities of the cards.  Thus, it becomes tricky to find a good card or the true high performance cards.  This is probably more so if you are using a video camera or other more intense speed device and may be less of an issue if you are generally reading off a card as you might do in an MP3 player, etc.This brings us to the Amazon branded cards.  With my dSLR (Pentax K5), I'm finding that the card(s), I have 3 of these now (1 8GB and 2 16GB), and they all perform as fast as any of my fastest cards without any noticeable issues.  They seem to perform better than cards I've obtained by Patriot or Transcend and as good as ones I have from Kingston and SanDisk.Would I pay more for them than other brands?  I doubt it.  Digital cameras, generally are not that intense with these cards.  I have Kingston class 6 cards that are comparable to these.  I also have my suspicions that most of the SD cards out there are probably produced by a limited number of producers and rebranded for sale.  These Amazon cards are almost definitely in that category.  As a result chances are they'll never be better than any specific brand or product, but they'll almost certainly always be as good.Last, the results you get will likely vary based on the product you are using your SD card in, the primary purpose of the SD card (reading vs. writing), and how much wear and tear your card takes.  To step back a bit, I rarely use video or continuous shooting with my camera.  In my typical shoot one photo at a time regime, any SD card works as well as any other, especially if you stick to those brands that are the most purchased.  Only once have I had a SD card fall apart, and while I could blame the manufacturer, it could just as well been something I did.  Amazon's cards seem to be as good as any of those brands I've purchased before, and they are a brand that is known to stand behind their products.""
"20111109","1.0","It pains me to leave this review.","Let me start by saying that I love Amazon and have purchased many Amazon Basic Products.  I have had no issues with any of their other products, but this one is completely defective. I am a professional photographer and I read some of the other reviews of this product but decided to give it a shot regardless.  I did not however use it on any of my paid shoots because the reviews made me a bit nervous.The very first use of this card was with my Nikon D7000 and about 20 shots in I started noticing that about 1/3 of my images were blacked out.  After making sure everything was fine with my camera and lens, I started shooting again and the camera displayed an error code for the card.  This camera has never had an issue before or since I used this card.  I was able to load the images taken on this card to my computer (shot in raw format) and the black bar was in nearly every image.This card my be worth the gamble if you are shooting just for fun, but I would personally recommend purchasing cards from sandisk or lexar.  Don't risk it!Like I said before, I love Amazon, but I find it necessary to leave an honest review.""
"20111108","3.0","Cheap storage.  Speed leaves something to be desired.","Cheap for 16GB.  But Class 10 feels like a stretch (though it technically is I'm sure).

"20111107","2.0","Probably great if they performed up to spec","Ordered two of these for my camera.  Ran some speed tests and one performed at about 50% rated speed and the other at about 10%.  For comparison I ran both of my old 8GB Class 6 card in the same reader and they handedly out-performed both 16GB cards.Reading other reviews, inconsistent performance seems to be a problem with these cards.  If that gets straightened out, you couldn't beat the value of these cards.""
"20111107","1.0","The worst I have ever used","I bought three of these cards when they were on sale.I spent a month shooting on the East Coast of the US and these cards always had an issue. You may get an error message on the camera (Nikon D7000), so you had to turn it off and on again; or sometimes you even had to pull the memory out and in again. Sometimes you did not get the error message but at the time I downloaded the photographs I would get some with writing errors (some strip lines).I have to say that I never had any issues when I did video with them.The bottom line is that you can not trust them.I did not want to listen the other reviews at the time I bought them, I always thought that sometimes you may get a bad unit but it was not going to happen to me. I am sorry I did not listen.I am planning on returning them to Amazon, I will keep you posted so you know if you can trust Amazon returns.""
"20111104","3.0","Decent, but....","Bought 2 of these a couple of months ago to be paired with a Nikon D7000 in preparation on shooting a relative's wedding. The card worked great. No  hiccups before, during or after the wedding ceremony and the reception. I shot purely NEF files and did not shoot to the point of filling the camera's buffer. Got around 600 photos that day. Went back to the hotel, plugged the card onto my laptop and imported all the pictures using Picasa. Also imported pictures from a backup camera  d90 with 4gb sandisk card  Again, everything went smoothly. Was beginning to really dig the card, relatively cheap and decent performance.  The following day, went home, plugged the Amazon basic card to my desktop to again import the pictures. 80 percent through the procedure, I get an error message and I cant import about 100 of my photos. Even through windows explorer,  I cant copy the last 100 pictures on the card. This is the first time I have encountered this problem. I have used multiple brands of sd cards  sandisk, kingston, transcend) and this is the only card so far that I had problems with data. luckily I already imported the pictures on the laptop so I didn't lose any.  Will format the card and see if the problem recurs but I don't know if I would a card that can potentially corrupt pictures/memories that I may not be able to recoverUpdate: 11/4/11Used different card reader, still can't import some of the pictures. Attempted to format the card using desktop and camera (D7000) multiple times, all failed. My friends, I now have a corrupted card. Fortunately my other Amazon basics 16gb sd card is still ok, hope it  lasts. Having second thoughts if I should trust these cards with my photos""

"20111101","5.0","Works great in my Camera!!!","Like most people,when it comes to anything real technical like these SD cards and microSD cards and what class is it..2,4,etc....I'm pretty ignorant,I use to be of the mind set that all this stuff is pretty much the same and companies just change the name and the packaging and charge us a little more money and we are none the wiser..Until now,I put this card in my Panasonic Lumix camera a couple of months back and the difference from the 2gb class 2 to the new 4gb class 10 is amazing. I noticed the difference when I put the camera on burst mode and took some pictures of my niece and nephews playing in the backyard. The 2gb would take 6 six in a couple of seconds but the new 4gig card would take a dozen or so in about the same time frame and they looked amazing when displayed on my laptop screen....no difference from the 2gig to the 4 in picture quality...I noticed the difference when I took video with the 4gig,absolutely fantastic quality...No problems with the card so far,I recently took about 450 pics and downloaded them into my laptop and they all came out great,so no problems with the card having any glitches or anything.....BUY THIS...you will love it!!!!""
"20111101","5.0","It's a class 10","It's important to inderstand that a writing speed equal or higher than Class 6 is neceessary mostly to record HD videos. I own a Lumix LX5 and Panny TM900, if you dare to use a class 4 or lower, these little guys would stop recording after 20 or 30 seconds showing a message that the writing speed of the memory card is too low, I did have spend several hundreds of dollars on certified SanDisk Extreme Class 10 SD cards and I regret it, I consider there's no difference when it comes to use it on a camera similar to the ones mentioned above, don't get me wrong, I know there may be some technical differences if you compare them using specialized testing software/hardware, it's just for me these perform excatly same.""

"20111029","1.0","very slow","While this is supposed to be a class 10 card, it's so slow in my digital camera that after taking a pic, it takes an extra sec or two before the camera is readied again.It's very surprising, because an older (class unknown) card that I bought 3 years ago didn't have the extra sec or two problem in the same digital camera.I didn't do a benchmark and see which SD card was faster, but my assumption of a brand new class 10 card was it ought to be faster than a 3-year old SD card as least in a digital camera.I returned it the same day it arrived.""
"20111029","3.0","Not good for HD video","I would have made a video review except my camera wouldn't record to this card. The capacity is great and the price was right, but if you're planning on using this in your HD video camera you may be disappointed to find that the only way it will work is if you use SD or a really low quality mode. My guess is that despite the Class 10 label, it really isn't fast enough to handle a 24 or 17 mbps video stream. If you're shooting photos, this will work.""

"20111024","5.0","Inexplicably, incredibly fast","In trying to determine how to compare speeds of comparable SD cards, I developed the following approach:*Test 1: Copy 80 files (~31mb) from my local hard drive to the SD card*Create a temporary directory on the SD card*Test 2: Duplicate the 80 files in the new directory (i.e. copying from the SD card to the new directory on the card)I figured these steps would test the card's read AND write capabilities.I compared the Amazon Basics card to a Transcend Class 10 card of the same capacity, using the same 80 files. The results were astounding.Test 1: Transcend, 63 seconds; Amazon Basics, 6 secondsTest 2: Transcend, 56 seconds; Amazon Basics, 6 secondsMy first thought was that there may have been some caching taking place to skew the results, so I immediately repeated both tests with similar results.

"20111019","1.0","Pay a little more for better quality","I purchased this as a lightening deal and figured I would take a shot.  Apparently my entire life I lived under the delusion that a memory card is just a memory card.  WRONG!!!  I used the card in my camera and it worked great for about 15 test shots.  I brought the camera with me to a concert, excited to have ample room for a lot of pictures.  Well it turned into a nightmare.  I was able to take 3 or 4 pictures and then the camera would say 'processing' for almost 10 minutes before I could take another picture. I put the camera aside, used my cell phone for pictures and then would try the camera again.  It did this every single time I tried to use it.  My first thought was that my trusty camera was going, but on a whim I tried switching out the card to the Transcend 16 gig card.  The camera worked fine afterwards.  To make matters worse, any pictures that I had taken on this card were corrupted and I couldn't get them off the card so I lost a good chunk of concert photos.  The following day, after formatting the card, I tried it again with just random pictures around the house.  Same exact results, it works fine in the beginning and then the 'processing' issue starts.  I tried the card in 4 different cameras all with the same results as well.Lesson learned the hard way & I'll pay more attention to what I'm getting.""

Though one can use a thumb drive to provide the same function, they stick out and have to be removed for transport lest you bump it and break something.  With the card, you can leave it stuck in, and only remove when you need to read another card, from a camera let's say.Plenty fast for my purposes, maybe even overkill.""

I store movie files and some isos that aren't going to be kept around, while downloads go to either that if I'm away from home or to a external drive at home.

My advice is to purchase from sellers who will accept returns, and keep your receipts.  It is probably a good idea to run several kinds of tests on new cards as they are received.  (Maybe format on computer, then format on camera,then take a dozen or so pictures of just junk.  Maybe do that a couple times.)

It does come in a nice frustration-free envelope, but I can't remember the last time I got a card in retail clamshell packaging. And price-wise, well, it's pretty much the same price as the competition most of the time. Now and again, the AmazonBasics card will appear as a Gold Box Deal or a Lightning Deal, at which point you can save significant money.I'd propose simply keeping an eye on the price of these and stocking up when they drop.

It may be hard to belive, but sometimes we've ended up on a vacation with that 32GB card getting close to full with movies and full resolution pictures.  So I thought this less expensive 8GB class 10 would be a cost effective 'just in case' back up to leave in the case for emergencies...  while not feeling like I've wasted a lot of money on a SDHC card I may never use)I formatted the card with the T2i camera and ran some continous shot tests and it was able to handle 4 to 5 continous shots at 18MP RAW which is fine for a backup.  1080i HD video also captured without any issue.  For what I will use it for, it's seems to be reliable enough, but I may continue to stick with Lexar for my higher capacity and reliability built into that brand and continue to use the amazon basics SDHC for the value oriented backup memory.  It fits a niche.""

They come mailed in a sturdy cardboard envelope with a bit of padding, and enclosed in the typical SDHC plastic case. Nice since you don't have to gnaw at plastic clam shell packaging for an hour trying to get the thing out like some of the other brands. Other than that, it operates transparently, just like SDHC and other flash memory should. I can't say what difference the transfer rates are between this and other brands, but I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary such as incredibly slow transfers, etc.Basically it's a good deal, saves you some money, and won't irritate you when the item arrives when you try to open it.""

Now that Amazon is cutting the middleman out of the process....I am all for it.  It is the same top quality, but it costs much, much less.I don't think I can put 8 GB of pictures in my camera.

Still, with the Amazon card costing about the same as the others, you get an extra shot with the Amazon Class 10 before it lags and has to empty the camera buffer to capture another image (that's what the lag is).Definitely a recommended buy.""

Not good.I have several AmazonBasics gear around here:  a camera bag, a camera 'skin' and now this memory card.  All have been made of good materials. I must say that I see no slow speeds with this card.  I can't compare this scientifically, but the Class 10 card is clearly faster than my Class 6 cards.I use this in my Canon xS and Canon T3.  The Canon T3 is a faster camera than the Canon xS, so it will automatically take more pictures per second.  I feel no lag in either the picture-taking or the video-recording.  But I am also not that particular, as long as my equipment works when needed and doesn't crash on me.  So far, so good.I have only had this card a week and haven't used the entire card's capacity.  Should I experience an error reading or this card dies on me (eventually they all do, it's just a matter of when), I will re-edit this review.This is a reliable, very efficient and extremely affordable memory card.

"20110925","5.0","Very fast and reliable data transfer","I checked out the speed of this card on getting image files to my PC.  Memory card speed ratings reflect the capabilities of the memory in raw terms, but I was curious to see what kind of difference it makes for a user doing typical file transfer operations.  The total 162MB file transfer completed in 30% of the time it takes with my Class 2 cards.  The file transfer to the card is also fast and completes in 50% of the time required for Class 2.The memory card has no problem keeping up with Hi-def (720P) 3D video and photos are also stored quickly.  Playback for the photos and videos are reliable.  Until now, the price of Class 10 SD cards has kept me from using high speed cards.  However, this brand seems like a great value for dependable memory, extended capacity, and high speed use.""

Not once did the card let me down.  Still shots and video recorded flawlessly, audio recorded clean and crisp and the laptop had no problems recognizing each of the different formats and uploading the various media.I also used the card to back up data from my hard drive with no problems whatsoever.  Because of this, I may abandon thumb drives completely and just use the card for my normal backups.  Much smaller and doesn't take up a USB port on my Vaio as the card reader usually sits empty anyway.Before using this card, I had always purchased Transcend class 10 cards, but based on the testing I did with this, from now on I will probably purchase the Amazon Basics card.

"20110922","3.0","It was good while it lasted","I know that sometimes cards just freeze up on you. But in over 5 years of using digital cameras with memory cards, I never ran into any problems. I bought this card a couple of months ago, an upgrade from Class 4 or 6 (don't remember exactly) and the speed change is undetectable. Slow write, slow delete, slow scrolling photo to photo. No difference between this one and my old SanDisk.But now, after just two months of use, the camera flashes that the card is write protected, and will not record anything. I made sure the little slider is unlocked. I inserted the card into the computer. It showed no files, but about 75% of space was being shown as in use, which means the photos are there. I put the card back in the camera and tried to review the content. I was able to see (and watch) the videos, but no photos. Thank GOD I just transferred photos to the computer, so I didn't lose any of them. This is the first card I ever had that corrupted/froze on me. Here I am, shopping for a replacement. NOT another Amazon one.""
"20110922","4.0","Class 10 Fast and a good price","As with all Amazon Basics products I've tried, this one has competitive performance and a better price than quality name brand alternatives. I compared it to a Transcend 8GB card I already own. It's capacity is the same, and speeds are so close that the difference is not apparent in normal use. If you are using a slow card, and especially if you are shooting video, you will be limited in the length of video you can shoot, as cards Class 6 and slower can't keep up. Even a minimal Class 10 card is working hard if you are shooting HD. This card, like the Transcend, is much faster than the minimum standard for Class 10, which is 10MB per second. Depending on the size of the file [larger files transfer faster] and whether it is reading or writing, the speeds I'm seeing are between 13 and 16 MB per second. Transcend is a little faster and currently costs about 10% more. If the Amazon card offered a savings on the order of 20%, I'd have given it five stars. As it is, it's competitive, and it's nice to save where you can, but I wouldn't call this a compelling deal.""
"20110922","4.0","Not for video...","I immediately put this in our Panasonic Lumix when we got it and for pictures it works great.  Rapid fire shots work fantastic.  The camera keeps right up using this RAM.However, when I tried using it for videos, something I do all the time using my Sandisk high end card, it would crash the camera.  Replacing it with the Sandisk Ultra would clear up the problem.I did this repeatedly, so it was definitely attributable to the card, not the camera.  Sandisk Ultra, fine.  Amazonbasics, crash.But when you consider the cost of the card and the quality for the money, you have to give it four stars.Nothing beats my Sandisk Ultra so I reserve the fifth star for that.""
"20110922","5.0","Excellent memory card","I shoot a lot of photos and high-definition video on a Canon Rebel T3i. The Rebel specs require at least a Class 6 card in order to be fast enough to write high-def video. So why get a Class 10 card? In addition to getting the video OFF the card faster (much faster), you can also take more consecutive photos without the card slowing down and limiting the speed at which you can click. This is especially useful when the camera is set to keep taking pictures as long as you hold down the shutter button.In short, this card is great. It offers TONS of space (it will hold over 5 hours of 1080p video!), lets me get the video to my computer quickly, and is far less expensive than the 'name brands' while offering the same quality. Highly recommended.""
"20110922","5.0","Works perfectly, great price","Class 10:  fast, and it doesn't disappoint.  Was able to record over an hour of high-def video from a camera without the camera having to deal with any slow write speeds.32 GB:  a huge amount of space (unless maybe you're recording hi-def videos all day long and don't have a way to xfer data off the card.  For pictures this one card would easily handle most a standard 1-2 week vacation for most people...and still have space left over.The competition:  charges more...but I'd buy this one over the competition.  I also have a Kingston version of the same thing (spec-wise), and they're interchangeable - I never think about which one to use to get better speeds or anything.Would highly recommend!

Some of the cards I have purchased in the past, weren't recognized properly and I had to initialize the card.  This one did not have that problem.This was an upgrade from an 8GB version of SanDisk so I'm happy with the added storage the 16GB provides.Transfer speed was also quick from taking picture to putting it on the card, and back from the card to my PC.""

I set my T1i to Raw mode, which means each photo is right at 20MB. I put it in continuous mode. With my Transcend Class 10 card, I got 8 shots in a row, then it slowed down. It then took about 14 seconds to stop accessing the card. With the AB card, I got 9 shots before it hesitated. It took about 9 seconds before it stopped accessing the card. I only repeated the experiment once with similar results. So like I say, it wasn't very scientific. But I conclude that this card is certainly quick enough for anything I would do. And as quick or quicker than the competition.Prices seem comparable, so no real savings there.""

They are good quality products and cost a little less than the other brands.  They also come in the Amazon frustration free packaging.  this comes in a small cardboard envelope with a small tear away strip for easy access.  Again a quality product at a great price.

"20110921","5.0","In a hurry?","Looking at the AmazonBasics SD8GbClass10--Hey, the description is longer than the card! Anyway, four quick questions come to mind.1. How easy is the package? Why can't they all come this way? Pull an envelope tab and the card is waiting for you in a plastic case. That's it.2. How much does it hold? I compared it to some other cards that I have. It holds the same amount as the other 8gb cards and comparable to other SD cards. In my camera (Nikon Coolpix S630), I could store over 1300 photos at 12mg per pic. Actually, I would never leave that many on card, but I still use 8gb and 16 gb cards. Video takes up a _lot_ more room.3. How fast does it work? I took some shots of my wife walking. She must love me because she didn't complain about walking back and forth on the driveway--even though it was clear she thought I was crazy. Anyway, shooting in sports mode (continuous photos at about 5 mg per photo), the camera will take 20 shots at a time and then load them to the card. It won't take any more pix until it has downloaded, so the faster card didn't help me get more action shots.The AmazonBasics card was as fast as my other Class 10 cards. They were all significantly faster than the Class 4 cards. How much faster? I am a consumer, so I don't have any fancy tools to measure. However, it was always easy to tell that it was faster--it seemed to vary depending on how many pix were already on the card, etc. At a race, concert, or other fast moving event, those seconds can make a big difference.4. Is Class 10 worth the price difference? Definitely. The price difference is just a few bucks--sometimes Class 10 is even cheaper than Class 4. Of course, there are some that are unbelievably more expensive, so be sure to shop around.""

I am currently using it in my Asus Netbook and even with this relatively slow device the card is performing very well.The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that established brand cards such as Transcend and Kingston come in pretty much at the same price, give or take a few cents. I think that with this almost negligible difference I'd probably go with a name brand card (even though the Amazon card is probably manufactured by one) before buying the Amazon card.Note: Just like at least one other reviewer, I tested the card and it also came up with an error message at first, so I am wondering if this is not really an error message but something related to how the card was designed. However, should reliability problems surface at a later point, I will definitely post an update.Other than that I am happy and would definitely buy it if they lowered the price to well below the other price points.UPDATE 9/27: Looks like the price is now lower than when I wrote the review.

I also tested both cards in my brother's DSLR, it was a newer Rebel and I got the same results.So unless you plan on using your SD cards for purely a data storage and data transfer device, these Class 10 Amazon Basics cards will be suffice even in most of the top of the line cameras.*****UPDATE******I ran this card through the H2TestW Memory Card Speed Test utility and came up with these results:AmazonBasics Class 10 SDHC 16GB100mb Write: 9.38 mb/s Read: 17.4 mb/s1GB Write: 10.4 mb/s Read: 17.4 mb/s5GB Write: 10.3 mb/s Read: 17.4 mb/s*These were single file transfers of 100mb, 1GB, and then 5x1GB files for the 5GB Test.

It's written in very light gray on a white sticker.  It took me practically a minute of squinting in good lighting to confirm that what I had received really was a class 10 card. (My vision is fine). On Transcend or SanDisk labels, they make it much more clear with higher contrast writing.  Believe it or not, as I'm shuffling through my collection of SD cards, the class does matter to me.  So I did take a sharpie and write '10' on the label.  Otherwise this would have cost me some time and frustration down the road.  Don't let this stop you - just saying, if you are someone who keeps a lot of cards around and cares about the class/speed of your cards, mark it down when you get this.  The 20 seconds is worth it.Amazon really is always improving their products and updating a sticker design is nothing, so I imagine they'll do it soon anyway and this review might then be a bit obsolete.  If the picture changes so that the '10' is not very light gray on white ... well, then ... you know they changed it.Overall, the price is stellar and the performance is completely top notch.  I'm really not nit-picking.  Card write speed matters, and being able to choose the right card matters.""

I reformatted it and re-tested, and the second time around there were no errors.Both times I have write speeds of around 15 MB/s and read speeds of 19.4 MB/s. Pretty respectable for a class 10 card.The error could have come from my computer's RAM and not the card, but I think that is fairly unlikely. I did test my computer's RAM with memtest86 when I installed it, and memory errors will usually result in an unstable system.I'll be running more tests over this card to make sure that it is stable before trusting it. I'm giving it a 4 star rating for now, assuming it is a fluke.It's a fast, big, memory card with a 1 year warranty. I'd say it is about as reputable as Kingston and Sandisk consumer series cards. SD cards are commodity items these days. Compare this with the price of other class 10 cards from reputable dealers (please, no eBay sellers from a foreign country) in making your purchasing decision.""

"20110919","5.0","As Good As Others For a Few Bucks Less","As a NON-techno geek, I don't know the ins and outs of the Class D or Class X (if there was a Class X) SDHC card. So, technically, I can't discuss how good is. However, I have Canon Powershot SX10 and a Powershot SX20 cameras that I use daily. The SX10 has a Transcend 8GB SDHC card and the SX20 has a SanDisk 8GB SDHC card.I only use SD cards in my cameras, so I don't care how many songs they hold. I do know that I can get about 500-600 photos at high resolution (which varies from 1.2 to 8GB depending upon lighting etc.) on an 8 GB card. Maybe if I ever get a vacation, I'd like a 16 GB card, but I download every night anyway. So much for capacity. The three cards (Amazon, SanDisk, Transcend) are the same.Speed. The SX10 camera WAS a little faster between shots with the Amazon card. However, the SX10 is also a little faster with the Sandisk card. There is no difference in speed between cards on the SX20. Also note that the card used in the SX10 - the Transcend - is two years old and has been formatted at least 100 times so there could just be some 'deterioration' of that card because of use. Therefore, this could be an invidious comparison.Would I recommend the Amazon card. Without reservation. However, from a photographic standpoint, I'd say the only advantage is that the Amazon card is about $2 cheaper. I can't say that it's really any better ... although the packaging didn't take a chainsaw to open.""

Amazon's got a brand and standard to maintain, so I was pretty sure this would end up being a quality item. I've got a Panasonic GH2 that I've been using this for, and haven't had any issues whatsoever with the speeds for both video and audio. With it being a 4 GB card, it does fill up pretty quickly (especially with vide), but that's certainly not necessarily its fault. If I'd gotten a bigger card (which I ended up doing--16 GB), I wouldn't have that issue. I'm sure this would be certainly enough capacity for the average consumer who has picked up a Sony, Samsung, Canon, or other similar digital camera.

A clear plastic storage case is provided as well. Amazon could improve the label though; the text and arrow indicating the lock direction for the write protection switch is in very small, low-contrast type. This is only a quibble because label design, of course, has no effect on the performance of the card.I don't pay much attention to error rates and read/write speeds when I'm messing around with my compact cameras but the read/write times were fast enough to not be a noticeable hindrance when I was out shooting. Even so, anybody who needs storage for mission-critical work or requires consistent high-speed performance should do a careful comparison of multiple cards.Bottom line: a good choice for 'everyday' storage needs.""
"20110503","5.0","Class 10 makes a difference","One of the common complaints with digital picture taking is speed of taking consecutive pictures and speed of initial access time.  In my wife's Powershot, she was using a 2GB base class card and considered it way too slow.  We upgraded to this class 10 card and it is definitely a noticeable difference.  The official speed ratings are linear in that class 10 is 10x the base speed, so for example, a class 2 card reads/writes at 2MB/s and a class 10 reads/writes at 10MB/s.  So if you are using an old class 2 or 4 card with a new camera, it's going to take a relatively long time to store a photo - with a 10-14 megapixel camera (depending on what compression level you use) a photo file might be 2-6MB in size; that could be several seconds to store on an old card or under a second with a class 10.""

It comes in a little, but functional plastic cover which easily fits in my camera pouch.

The good speed rating should make it acceptable to use with compatible cameras and camcorders.The card gets 3 stars (means 'it's Okay') because the price is not exactly a bargain and because 4GB is really small in this day and age. The speed rating and the excellent Amazon service for the AmazonBasics line (easy to return, warranty service) are pluses.Notes of Caution:- This is an SDHC (with the HC underlined) card. Which means that some older devices may not support it even if it fits into the slot. You are safe if your gadget specifically specifies support for SDHC (as opposed to SD only). If not, it could still work but it's a gamble.- Make sure that this is the correct physical size before you order. SDHC cards also come in 'mini' and 'micro' sizes. While the 'micro' cards are easy to recognize because they are VERY small, the 'regular' (24 mm wide) and the 'mini' (20 mm wide) can be easily confused.- In addition, some old cameras may not recognize memory above 2GB and will format the card to use 2GB only.- Amazon lumped together reviews for AmazonBasics SDHC cards of several capacities. Be aware the 4GB is the ONLY one that is 'class 10'. All the other cards are 'class 4' at the time I'm writing this, meaning that they are a lot slower:  Class 4 = 32 Mbit/second vs. Class 10 = 80 Mbit/s.""

All of that can really eat up space quickly, so I was glad I got a SDHC card.I've used many other amazon basic items like HDMI cables and other electrical cords, and they've all served me well, so I didnt worry about a amazon branded SDHC card. For all I know, they're probably made on the same assembly line as a big brand name card like SanDisk or PNY.Write speeds, they're quick. My old camera used to make me wait 2-3 seconds after taking a photo, and waiting for it to write on my old old SanDisk 2GB SD card. Now after using this, instantly, I can shoot more photos and videos without needing to wait for it to write to the card.Read speeds are pretty quick, all my pictures and videos showed up within seconds. My old Sandisk would make me sit there for a minute or two while it read each image and created preview icons for them in windows.I highly recommend it to anyone who's into photography or just likes to shoot tons of videos/photos.

"20120421","5.0","Excellent value.","I've purchased several of these Basics cards and have never had a problem.  The Class 10 card is just fine for HD video and I do not have any shutter lag, which can be caused by lesser cards.""
"20120420","5.0","8GB card","Took many photos on the card, seemed as fast as my other 4 8GB class 10 cards. I haven't done speed tests but downloading to computer is quick. No issues with card so far.""
"20120418","3.0","not ReadyBoost capable ...","I was hoping to use it as a ReadyBoost drive under Windows7 Professional on a toshiba r835-p81 Portege.Windows would not use it.""
"20120415","2.0","live and learn","I purchased the 4,8,and 16 GB Class 10 Amazon Basics SDHC flash memory none of them was recognize, I use SanDisk no problem. So for me I will stick with SanDisk.""
"20120415","5.0","Love it","No problems with this card, and i love all the space it has to offer. its pretty fast, not as fast as some of the higher end class 10 cards but still pretty fast, my camera does not complain. after all the videos and pictures i have taken with this card i still have not filled it up, and thats switching between 2 cameras, a camcorder and a 12.1MP point and shoot with HD video. i love this card and for the price its the best out there.""
"20120414","5.0","Great memory card","I'm using this card in my Canon Rebel T3i DSLR camera with the 18 Megapixel plus RAW setting which puts the most intensive load on the card and it is working great.  I've taken about 500 shots with it so far and it hasn't had any issues.  I'm also able to take 4 or 5 high speed continuous shots with it on 18+RAW setting and 100+ with it on 18 megapixel JPEG mode.Even though this is called Amazon Basics, I don't think they skimped on anything.""
"20120412","4.0","Good inexpensive card","The card does its job .  Is fast with good results in color rendition.Is fast in both read and write.""
"20120410","5.0","Excellent product!!!","I bought it for my new cannos sx40hs and worked great,on the bestresolution I can take almos 10,000 pictures at 12 MP,""
"20120409","5.0","cheap and reliable","I got this as Amazon was giving it for free when combining with a Canon camera purchase last year.It worked well and has not given my any problem. The read and write speed was reasonable. With the price in mind, I think this is a wonderful product.""
"20120408","5.0","Similar to SanDisc Extreme 3","I've been using this card a bit over three months and thus far, no challenges like those reported by other reviewers.  I purchased this card for my Nikon D3100 after the previous card I had, a SanDisc Extreme 3, started acting up when putting it in my card reader.  The Amazon Basics card is fast, and hasn't lost any data yet.I've been thrilled with the quality of AmazonBasics products and love the price point even better!""
"20120407","5.0","Perfect for the price","I need an additional memory card that was class 10 and this was the one I chose based on price. It works as advertised and was shipped in less than 2 days.""
"20120406","2.0","Too slow for Class 10","This card tested as too slow to qualify for Windows 7 ReadyBoost use, which makes me seriously doubt whether it's really Class 10 at all.""
"20120403","5.0","Great price Good Read/Write Speeds","This was the cheapest Class 10 SD card I could find for my camera. I was originally using the included Class 4 and found that videos took to long to write between recordings. This has corrected that issues, and cut my transfer speeds (to my computer) down my a quarter.Read/Write Test using an internal SD Card Reader on my laptop:Write Speed: ~ 15 MB/sRead Speed: ~ 22 MB/sOverall I'm impressed by the price and speed.""
"20120403","5.0","hey, it works","It works great for my camera.  Tons of storage.  Fells plenty quick on the puter.  Not much more that you could ask for.""
"20120403","5.0","Great value","When purchasing an SD card, cheaper is not always better. I was pleasantly surprised that this amazon basics card is a class 10 card, which refers to the read/write speed. Much better than the cheapo cards that are class 4. It worked great in all my devices  Buy this card, you won't be disappointed. Keep it up amazon basics!""
"20120402","1.0","card error","after using the card less than five months began getting card error. lost a 2 year olds photo shoot. they are sending a replacement, but wish it could replace the photos i lost :(""
"20120401","1.0","Sudden failure after several months of use","I purchased 2 of these cards.  They worked fine for several months.  Then, the other day, I was using one of them while shooting my daughter's clogging competition, and it suddenly failed by locking up.  By this, I don't mean a simple software failure, but a hardware failure because the card is not even recognizable to my computer or camera no matter which SD card reader I use.  The bad thing is, the photos on the card are worth more to me than the card itself, and I don't even know if I'll be able to recover them.The worst part is, I had several hundred photos from our Washington DC trip still on the card and not backed up elsewhere when I was shooting the clogging.  Quite possibly, those are gone forever.  Bottom line:  these cards are worth about what you pay for them.  If you use them, you should clear them every evening, which I got lazy and failed to do.  I am going to seek out a data recovery service for my bad card.  As for my good one, I think I'll limit its use to a digital photo frame.  Hopefully, I've just gotten one of the few bad 'copies' out there and most of them are OK.""
"20120401","4.0","No Worries","An ordinary product at a decent price. Arrived on time. Exactly what I expected.Installed it in my Canon SX 150, read my review of that too if you are so inclined, and away I went taking pictures.""
"20120331","5.0","As advertised","I order a 32gb class 10 card, and it does just that.  After many months of use, still no issues.  I saved some money by ordering the 'amazon' brand, but in reality, I am proud of the 'amazon' brand and amazon.com!""
"20120330","5.0","Not so basic","Amazon has really come a long way. This is a great product and a great price. You really can't ask for more. Keep on making great stuff!""
"20120330","1.0","Reliable but awfully slow.","PROS: It's huge and it's cheap and the packaging comes with a super-handy little protective case. The write-protect switch is nice, too. It's reliable and hasn't lost any data or failed to be recognized in any reader I have.CONS: 'Class 10' was supposed to be fast, I spent a bit extra for it specifically. It's not. It's not QUITE floppy-disk slow, but it's somewhere between regular hard drive access and 56K modem slow. If you're getting this for heavy camera use, it's probably ok. But if you're going to be using it on a computer, forget about doing anything with the stuff on the card without copying it to your computer.END THOUGHTS: I'd give it more stars if it weren't for the fact that I got a card this large specifically because it was class 10, and that was supposed to be fast. The one factor I wanted was speed, if I would have known it was this bad, I would not have gotten it.""
"20120328","5.0","Excellent product","Excellent Product. 100% Recommended. Works perfect with my Canon Rebel T3. It arrived on time and it was the best one I could find for its price.""
"20120327","5.0","Performs like an expensive sandisk","For a fraction of the price, my wife now has a 16MB SD card for her SLR.  It's just as fast and reliable as the kingston and sandisk cards we have.  We have been very impressed with anything labeled Amazon Basics!""
"20120327","5.0","Gandyson","I recently received this card as a gift. I used it on a vacation where I was taking photos and videos with a Canon T2i under every type of condition. Everyday I took more that a thousand photos on high resolution and had room left over for 30 minutes or more for video. I never missed a shot because the card was too slow. By comparison I also used a high end card that cost twice what this cost and saw no difference. Each night I would download all the photos and videos clear the card and was ready for the next day. Never experienced any problems and wondered why anyone would spend twice as much.""
"20120326","5.0","Amazon Basics","Amazon does it again.  Sell a product under their name for half the price, and it does the same job as the others.Bought this for my Point and shoot camera.  Its no slower then the one I had in there before.""
"20120326","4.0","Nice and handy, works well","I am going to college for a degree in photography. I take a lot of photos and this is nice to have on hand for a big photo shoot. It is also a class 10, so it works well with video.""
"20120326","5.0","Lots of storage, lots of savings","What can you really say about a memory card?  It works and it stores stuff.  That is exactly what this one did and it cost the least amount of money.  Sounds like a recipe for a purchase""

"20120325","5.0","Good buy!","I haven't seen that many 32 GB Class 10 SD cards locally.  I paid 33.27 for this card on Amazon, and it came in a few days with free shipping, which is just a little over a dollar per gigabyte.  It also came with a nice case to protect the card when i'm not using it in one of my devices.  I'd recommend it to my friends.""
"20120324","5.0","works great","card works great for a great price, use it on my nikon d7000 for all different occasions / events, it is not as fast as a more expensive card but it is a class 10 and gets the job done""

"20120321","5.0","Used it as extra RAM in my Windows 7 laptop","I recently started working at a new company and I received a brand new Dell laptop running Windows 7 (32 bit edition).As a designer, I'm in and out of Photoshop all day, and as you might know, Photoshop is one of the most RAM intensive programs you can add to a PC.  Well, I was out of luck, because Windows 7 (32 bit edition) can only recognize 4GB of RAM (3.2 usable) regardless of how much you install.  So, when I'm running Photoshop alongside other programs like Outlook or Google Chrome, things slow down... a lot.Now, there a bunch of tweaks you can make to Photoshop to make it less memory hungry, but that's just like telling someone to walk slower on their broken leg.  The other option was to reformat the computer (wiping out all of my programs/settings) and install the 64 bit version of Windows 7.Fortunately, Windows 7 has a little-known feature called ReadyBoost.  It allows you to dedicate a hard drive (up to 4GB - 8GB) as extra memory in case you run out of RAM.Since this SD Card is pretty fast (Class 10), I gave it a try and I immediately noticed a difference in Photoshop.  It opens faster, I can zoom without the picture stuttering, and it is generally smoother all over.  All I had to do is put the card into the laptop's SD card slot, go to MY COMPUTER, right click on SDCARD, and click on the 'Dedicate to ReadyBoost' tab that comes up.  That's it.  When the RAM would normally overflow onto the slower internal hard drive, it uses the SD Card as a solid state scratch drive instead.For the price, it was well worth the experiment and I'm very pleased with the results.""

It worked great until I got to about 1,000 photos and then it started to malfunction and I was unable to take pictures for a while and found out that several I had taken were lost! I thought maybe it was me and tried it another time and it did the same thing. So upset!""
