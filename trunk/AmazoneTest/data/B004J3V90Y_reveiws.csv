"20120609","5.0","Excellent Camera","This is my first Canon camera and I am in love!  The camera is easy to work on auto while I work my way through the manual to find out how to be more creative.  So excited to take tons of photos!""
"20120607","5.0","Amazing right out of the box!","I made the switch to Canon after being disappointed by my Sony DSLR. Every photographer I know and respect has a Canon in their hand so I knew there had to be a reason.Right out of the box, this takes amazing photos! It's done surprisingly well even in low lighting without a flash. I've had very few blurry shots and the few that I did have were when the subject moved abruptly.So far I've just been using the auto settings, but this weekend I plan to read the booklet that came with it and really learn about the manual controls. With that said, if you're a beginner, I think you'll be impressed at how well the auto controls do for every day shooting.The HD video exceeded my expectations. Just know in advance that this is not intended to be a full fledged camcorder. If your video becomes too long, the camera will overheat and it will stop recording. This isn't a defect. You can't expect a DSLR to do what a camcorder does because they don't have the same mechanics. But this camera is more than sufficient for short video clips and the clarity is very nice. It's much better than carrying around a DSLR and a camcorder on vacation!Just make sure your SDHC card has the number 6 or higher on it. The sales person didn't explain that to me and I got a card with a 4 on it. 4 is too slow for recording HD video. The camera will automatically stop recording after a few seconds.I'm in love with this camera so far and look forward to learning more about its features! The 360 degree swivel screen is worth the extra money too. It really makes a difference and the colors are very accurate. The screen has a non-glare and smudge resistant finish which helps a lot.As far as construction, the location of the menu button is strange. It's on the left, and as a right handed person, it always feels out of reach. Everything else is being controlled with my right hand and it feels awkward when I have to control the menu with my left.A few people have mentioned the grip of the camera body. I do understand that. When I'm holding it, I always feel like I'm about to drop it. Not sure what to say about that. Just be sure to wear the strap that comes with the camera! :)""

I use the various quick settings on the dial and go, this camera takes amazing pictures.  I previously owned a Digital Rebel XT which was great as well, but this is far better for a few reasons.  First it is faster to start, it has the adjustable LCD viewfinder, and most importantly shoots HD video.  The video quality is ridiculously good as well AND I only need to carry and operate one camera now.I replaced the kit lens with an EF-S 18-135mm and 55-250mm and with my tripod can take just about any shot and video even at his baseball games.  Combine a battery grip and 32GB memory card and I can get through an entire tournament shooting a ton of pictures and short videos.I bought a killer camera like this BECAUSE I am not a photographer and it allows me to take great pictures and video.I highly recommend this camera to anyone in a similar situation, it has paid for itself many times over already.""

It's not quite a professional grade camera, but it's a good step up from the cameras below it.

"20120220","4.0","Mostly Great - But 100% as described for Video","This camera was purchased mainly for its HD Video capabilities. Having multiple lens options that are affordable in a more compact design makes the DSLR video world very appealing. The T3i is a really nice entry level DSLR, but for video use, there are few problems.The 'HDMI Out' when router thru the camera is not really 1920x1080, as described. It's more like 1620x. And when you press record on the camera, the HDMI Out drops its signal even more, to Standard Definition. For us, this is a major issue. If your workflow only requires you to record internally to your SD card, and you're totally content having your original footage saved as an h.264 file, this isn't a problem. In addition, a few Canon DSLRs (and maybe others) have a well-known limited record time, approximately 10 minutes before overheating then shutting down. To reduce compression and loss of color, and to increase our record time, we planned to use the HDMI Out and save our footage to an external recorder in a better format. We were unpleasantly surprised to find that this cannot be done. Limitations such as these should be boldly disclosed in Canons documentation. Again, the T3i is a wonderful little DSLR and prefect for what DSLRs in its class were traditionally designed to do; capture great still photography images.""

"20120219","4.0","Improved Sensor for Reds, Some Back Focusing Problems","I am a painter/illustrator who primarily uses a camera for photographing reference (live models, objects, locations) and making images of my artwork. I previously owned a 40D and was very happy with it. There were some back focusing issues but Canon had recalibrated it and it was working great. One day, though, when I was trying to photograph a painting with some very saturated reds, I noticed the camera just couldn't handle this spectrum of colors--they were strangely murky and smeared looking, lacking crisp details. I wondered if perhaps some of the newer cameras could handle reds better.I then looked at the review for the T3i on dpreview. They test all their reviewed cameras at varying ISO's with an elaborate studio still life; the results can be seen at the end of each review on a page called 'Studio scene comparison (RAW)'. You can view the images at full resolution and compare sections shot with many different cameras. There are several small bright red fuzzy balls in the still life that are excellent measures for red. I noticed with interest that most cameras (including the 1D!) did not capture the reds well--they had the same murkiness that I noticed with my 40D. There were, however, a few notable exceptions, including Canon's T3i, 60D and 5D Mark II; and Nikon's D3. The red fuzzy balls shot with these had well-defined, clear details, without the problems other cameras suffered from. The 60D, unfortunately, had an orange cast in its reds, leaving the T3i the undisputed winner among lower priced models. Please note: most reviews claim that all the Canon 18 mp cameras have the same sensor--this comparison seems to indicate that they have redesigned or tweaked it for these most recent models.I purchased the T3i and, because of past problems, carefully tested its focusing accuracy. I ended up exchanging the first one because it seemed a bit sluggish, although it was accurate. This was a big mistake! The second one was accurate in the outside points, but back focused in the center point. I exchanged this one and ended up with one that had an accurate center point but back focused with the outside points! This is a fairly minor problem--it's off by about 1/8'. Targeted details are on the edge of the zone of sharpness rather than the center, and it's only noticeable in critical close-up shots with the aperture wide open. Still, it could be a problem for portrait and macro shots. I kept it but may send it in to be calibrated.Aside from this, it's a great camera. Beautiful, detailed images, great dynamic range, and the extra resolution gives me room to crop. The high ISO image quality is infinitely superior to the 40D.I also enjoy playing with the video function, with one disappointment: the digital zoom starts at a 3X magnification and goes up to 10X. That means you cannot shoot without any magnification when the camera is switched to digital zoom, a limitation which demands considerable room to back up from your subject. I don't know why Canon designed the zoom like this; it renders a potentially wonderful feature almost useless in an average indoor setting.""

"20120216","5.0","Great Digital SLR","I am a 'hobby' photographer, so I hope that you consider this point when you read this review;As a Canon user for almost 20 years, I'm never disappointed any Canon products I've used. I bought this EOS T3i after using my EOS 350D for 7 years.  Although this camera shares the same base with 350 D, it has some critical 'update' that I find important; - T3i sensor works definitely fine and 18mp image quality is quite successful. I had a chance to try 60D before and I can say that image quality of the picture taken by these two cameras are almost same. If you support with good lenses, you can have high quality images with T3i body. - The movable LCD screen is far my favorite. It gives a pleasure when you use the camera. In fact I feel like I  am playing a new toy. - The IS system on lenses works fine. I have several picture taken in low light, but they are quite sharp.Other than that, it is a very great DSLR...I have not try the video option but I am sure it gives satisfying results.""
"20120216","5.0","Perfect for beginners!","I love the T3i.  It produces good quality images; even in low light, the image noise is not horrible.  The rotating LCD protects the screen, but is still convenient to flip out quickly when needed.  The menu is easy to navigate, I have always been able to find everything I need within a few seconds.  So far, it has been a very user-friendly camera in basically every way.The kit lens is great for the price.  If you are looking for a good beginner camera and plan on buying 2 or 3 lenses to start with, then I would recommend it.  Being a beginner myself, I was looking for one lens to use for several weeks before buying another.  The lens is great and performs exactly as described, but I soon felt very limited as far as aperture goes.  To other beginners looking for a single lens, I might recommend the 50mm f/1.8.  Otherwise, this lens has been great to have on hand and I have learned a lot using it.This camera/lens is by far one of the best investments I have made!""

"20120214","5.0","Awesome Camera for beginners and filmers","So I'm a film student and I decided to upgrade from my Panasonic DVX100A camcorder to something that can do HD. T3i is a really good camera for the price and for what it is. For film this camera is awesome, it has option for an external mic and I would recommend this model over the T2i because of the swivel screen but also for the manual audio controls. The T3i is definitely modeled more for film than the T2i. I heard T2i does well if you get magic Lantern but I didn't want to have to hack my camera software to get the benefits of audio controls that the T3i already has built in. The T3i gives plenty of options for filming it has 1080p 24p, or 720p 60p, and some others that I wasn't interested in. I just care about the film look and some higher frame per seconds to do some super nice slow motion. The benefits of filming with the T3i is that you can interchange the lens and really add more to your cinematography. The only downside to the camera when it comes to filming is that there is about a 12-15 min cap on how long you can film one continuous clip in Full HD, if the clip exceeds 4 gb in size the camera will automatically stop recording, although recording back to back is not a problem, just an inconvenience that make camcorders still the leading cameras for broadcasting. This camera is not ideal for filming events but good for making narratives. The quality is amazing and has convenient controls to change shutter speeds and aperture and ISO. For filming this camera is superior to its Nikon competitor Nikon D3100. For Photography this camera does pretty well, its 18 mp picks up clear and crisp pictures it has a ISO range from 100-6400, but beware that ISO 3200-6400 the pictures have considerable noise. It shoots 3.7 pictures per sec and has a max shutter of 1/1000 not bad a little less than the 60D and 7D but it shares the same sensor as them, it is a great camera if you're learning photography or wanting to get into video. Easy to use has a good interface and comfortable grip. and sturdy build.""

"20120212","5.0","Great  Piece of Equipment","Works great and I paid only $694 including tax. Extensively tested this camera and all is well. Tilt/flip LCD Screen is very handy and this allows you to even take pictures of yourself. The upper priced DSLR Canon models lack this feature. This is all the camera your amateur photographer will ever need. It feels light and is well balanced in your hands. If you want better quality pictures than the provided kit lens gives you, go buy yourself a Canon L lens for this T3i body. Buying a better body is not the answer to better pictures. It is like stereo equipment, the quality of the Stereo PreAmp/Amp  can only audibly improve the sound just so much. Having overkill amp power and statistical levels of inaudible  distortion, that the ear cannot hear in the first place, does not improve sound quality. The 'SPEAKERS' are the only part of the system that can do that. So here too, it is the 'LENS' that really makes the difference in 'PICTURE QUALITY' and not the camera bodies that have overkill features not necessary for 99.99% of camera users. Don't waste your money on those bells and whistles, buy yourself a better lens instead.The T3i is a great camera body and the 55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS kit lens is not bad either for the money.""

The only thing I would do differently is that I would have just bought the body and then purchased a better lens. The kit lens the T3i comes with (EF-S 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 IS) is fine for a while but if you take a lot of pictures you might notice that it can give you soft pictures at the telephoto end. Especially if you have the lens wide open. Stopping it down does help a little. If your pictures will mostly be taken using the wide angle range with the lens not wide open then you might not notice many issues.""

"20120209","1.0","Canon T3i","I cannot give an ultimate review at the moment, because I haven't taken a complete test run.  But I know from looking at the menu and specs I really like my Pentax K-X.  The software with this camera is bland and not as advanced. It only offers a few filter options, including Toy Camera, Fisheye (which a lens is better anyway), Black and white.  I have read reviews and have heard that Canon's have more 'noise' in the pictures, so hopefully I do not notice this.  I know sometimes my Pentax can cast a slight grey tint to it, I'm hoping with a Canon I do not have this conflict.  I purchased this camera to escape my comfortzone from my Pentax addiction, but I'm pretty sure in most cases I will use my Pentax.  Once I take a test run, I will further update, and I'm only judging by the software that is on the camera I am not impressed.  The camera is lightweight, the lens isn't that wonderful (but then again, I have always had Pentax lenses, so I'm trying to be open about the change).  I have purchased an adapter but still am debating on the first lens to buy for this camera.  The functions as in processing of the a picture is amazingly fast, I am impressed by that.

"20120206","5.0","Amazing camera","This is my first DSLR and I couldn't be happier with it. I bought the body only, then got a Canon 28-105 lens seperately. I recently purchased a 50mm f/1.8 lens as well.The camera is very easy to learn how to use. I watched some videos on youtube and skimmed the manual online while I was waiting for it to come in the mail (I ordered it from a different site around New Year's, so I had about a week and a half wait from when I ordered it) and as soon as I got it, charged the battery and started using it. Before this, I was using my video camera or old point and shoot for stills, but I have used a couple of other people's DSLRs (on auto mode). I've been using this exclusively in manual mode so far and it took a little bit the first day to get used to picking the right exposure settings, but once I got used to it, it's not bad. This camera takes really great photos.Other good things are: compared to my Canon Vixia HF200 (video camera), the battery seems to last a comparable length with video and the recording rate is somewhere around 5.5 mb/s with the T3i, where it goes up to 24mb/s (I believe) on the HF200, so the videos don't take up as much room on the memory card or my computer, but they look better because of the lenses and, I assume, the proccessing. The audio is surprisingly good too. I shot a video at a local show recently (**Youtube search 'chunkvideos analecta' and it's the song called 'Just Don't Look Down'**), standing about 3 feet to the side of the speakers and right in front of the band (they're an instrumental band, but they're loud for a local show), and I manually adjusted the audio level to the lowest possible level (it indicated clipping otherwise) and the video actually sounds really good. I wasn't expecting it to sound good. That being said, when you're not in a loud environment, the internal mic picks up all of the camera and handling noises, so the fact that it has a mic input jack will come in handy in getting better audio.The autofocus works good sometimes. I'm trying to mostly use manual focus unless I'm taking a photo of my puppy running around the yard or something with similar action (which is also hard to autofocus on, btw). I used autofocus the first few days and it wouldn't always focus where I wanted it to (it'd focus on my puppy's nose or toys instead of her eyes, etc). I know there is a way to select focus points, but I'd rather just do it manually, plus it doesn't have full time autofocus while shooting video. Autofocusing on video does not look or sound good with this camera.I haven't used the vari-angle screen as much as I thought I would yet, but even without using it for different angles, it's pretty convenient. I like that I can store it with the screen facing towards the camera body, so it's protected. I also like that when I have it flipped out to the side, my nose isn't against the screen and there is a little extra room for my face when I'm looking through the viewfinder. I have tried 'self portraits' with it (in quotes because half of them were just me pointing the camera at my face), but it's hard to do without a tripod because neither of my lenses will focus closer than 18'. It's kind of hard with a tripod too, because of focusing before you get to where you're going to stand (again, autofocus wouldn't focus on my face).Continuous shooting and exposure bracketing are really nice features. I also like that you can do both with a timer. Exposure bracketing is something that I overlooked when I was researching camera options, because I didn't know what it was. You can quickly and easily set your camera to take 3 continuous photos with the same aperature, but at different shutter speeds, so it produces an under exposed, normally exposed, and over exposed version of the same shot (assuming you use a tripod or hold the camera really still) and if you use software that can merge the three images into one, you can create an image that shows details in the dark, light, and medium areas of the photo. For instance, in a normal photo of a sunset, the sun would be bright and anything like trees or buildings in the foreground would be dark, merging would allow you to see details in the foreground too.Pros:-Photo quality-Manual settings-Ease of use-Manual focus-Low noise-Good low light shots-1080p video with good quality-Manual settings for video-Vari-angle screen-Mic input jack-Manual audio levels-Small file sizes for HD video-Not too big or heavy-The flash doesn't pop up in manual mode (it hasn't for me anyway)-It actually comes with usable software (I've been doing all of my photo editing with the included software, I think it's called Digital Photo Professional)-It can store camera and lens setting information on your photos (not literally on them, but in the file information)-Continuous shooting works nicely-Exposure bracketing is a cool feature which allows you to edit high dynamic range photos-Able to use a timer and choose how many shots you want the camera to take and if you want it to be exposure bracketed or notCons:-Autofocus hasn't worked well for me-Cropped sensor makes it hard to get wide angle shots without spending a lot on a nice lens""
"20120206","5.0","Everything I expected!","Coming from an old rebel XTi, the T3i walks wonders around its older counterparts.  The body feels better, tighter, and sturdier.  The buttons and menu can be intimidating at first, but take your time to learn Canon's system because it's worth it!  It takes beautiful photos and the ability to shoot in RAW is all you need to have professional photos without spending > $2K on a camera!  I'd love to upgrade to a 5D or 7D someday but I don't know about that, so for now I'm sticking with the T3i (600D).  Couldn't be happier!""

Since retiring from my days as an outlaw, I have been traveling the American countryside taking photos of bridges. So I needed a great camera to do it. This more than meets my expectations. It is everything you can hope for when producing photos of bridges. One day while looking for a bridge I met a woman named Francesca Johnson. Her husband and children were away at the Illinois state fair. She had become restless and disillusioned with what her life had become after having to make a very difficult choice in her youth when she was known as Sophie. We bonded and proceeded to have a 4 day affair that embodied the true love of our lifetimes. But our paths led to separate lives. Her with her family and mine as a photographer for National Geographic magazine. When I pass away, I hope to have my ashes scattered off Roseman Bridge.-Robert Kincaid""
"20120131","2.0","Kit lens inferior, images too soft in all settings, cheap build","I got this camera with the kit lens and was so disappointed in general with 1. the horribly slow, hunting, and soft focusing of the lens and resulting blurred and unacceptable images at any ISO, and forget about using live view to focus either manually or on auto. You have to use the viewfinder but that's not such a big deal and I expected that as well as with any DSLR, but not such inferior images in all cases, skin tones off, colors off, super soft edges...nothing looked good right out of the camera hand held or or on a tripod (minor improvement only). 2. the build looks and feels cheap, all plastic flimsy parts...feels exactly like it was made in China by human robots with cheap cost saving parts.My old 35mm Canons (built in Japan with superior sturdy materials) were built like little tanks and were still in excellent to pristine condition after decades of use and this model Canon just can't compare. Even the kit lens felt and looked cheap.The good: fairly easy menu and GUI.The possible good: maybe this camera with a very high end lens would make all the difference in image quality.Next: going to try the Nikon D5100 which supposedly has a better kit lens and superior image quality in all cases.*Please fanbois...don't get upset like you always do when someone posts their own opinion from experience with using a product that you adore and will defend no matter the facts.""
"20120131","3.0","I really wanted to love it, BUT...","I chose this camera (after reading many reviews) based on it's low light capabilities. It does take very nice quality low light pictures as long as the subject is sitting still. The problem is I bought it to photograph my daughter's gymnastics meets. It is, in my opinion, one of the toughest things to shoot (and I've taken almost 30,000 pictures since I got my first digital camera in 2004)--low light, no ability to use flash, high speed, from a distance and people frequently walking in front of the subject. Unfortunately, this camera could not get the job done. The issue was the autofocus. I tested the sports setting, resetting aperature and shutter speed, and various focus settings. I just could not get a clear picture...and I shot almost 1400 before returning the camera. I opted for the Sony a55 and couldn't be happier! Crystal clear action shots with vivid color on the first try. I used a tamron 2.8, 70-200 lens & a tripod for both cameras so the only thing I can attribute the difference to is the camera itself. So, to sum it up...if you are only taking still pictures, the canon is fine BUT if you are shooting any movement at all, get the Sony.""

"20120128","5.0","Great first DSLR","This camera has pretty much gone above and beyond my expectations. Very easy to use, lightweight, portable, and great image quality. The articulated screen is both useful and very clear. The only major downsides for me is the small grip, and lack of a dedicated AF assist lamp. But these are pretty minimal for  how great it is (and that it's not a pro level camera).The lens is good all around for a starting kit lens, and has served me well, but you might be better off investing in a quality lens right off the bat, as these will stick with you longer than a camera body (something like a 17-50 or 55 f/2.8 as a walk around). Also, the zoom is loose, so the lens extends by itself when angled downwards.I would recommend reading over in-depth reviews though if you are serious about buying a DSLR as short reviews like this probably won't do them justice.""

"20120128","5.0","Great camera","Overall this is an outstanding DSLR camera.  I had compared this to the Nikon D5100 and am really glad this one won out.  Even with the kit lens the picture quality is outstanding, and the menu functions are very easy to use.  The menu/navigation on the Canon is far easier to use than is the Nikon, and I found the picture quality to be superior on the Canon as well.This camera was my first jump from the mirrorless to the DSLR world and I am definately not disappointed.  The kit lens is good (I got the 18-55mm), although I have been lens shopping and the kit lens is just part of my case now.  However, it still gets used almost as frequently as any other.The IS system is great, and eliminates a need for a tripod for mid shutter speeds.  I have some steady hands so I can go lower than most, but friends have used the camera and gotten some really sharp shots at slow speeds that would be impossible with older cameras.Overall an outstanding buy and a camera that will, thanks to the EOS lens system, grow with you.  I am not noticing any differences between my pictures and those taken with the 'mid-level' cameras that are twice the price.  Buy and you won't be disappointed.""

"20120125","5.0","Canon T3i - Best DSLR for Under $1,000?","Check out my full T3i review video, video clips, sample photos and time lapse on YouTube. On YouTube search '2012 T3i Best DSLR'Okay, now let's take a fresh look at the Canon EOS Rebel T3i (600D) DSLR and compare it to the 60D and T2i. In this review I'll also talk about some 'MUST HAVE' accessories for this camera.The Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR was release in March of 2011 and has quickly become one of the most popular DSLRs available.As if the Rebel line wasn't popular enough with budding photographers... The introduction of the T3i has captured the imagination of thousands of aspiring videographers... with it's ability to capture FULL HD video... bright, articulating 3 inch LCD screen (which comes in really handy when shooting video in the field), and the ability to select from a host of lenses... which is common to DSLRs in general.Professionals prefer DSLRs because they allow for an accurate preview of what they are shooting, at the moment they push the shutter button. DSLRs also have larger sensors than compact point-and-shoot digital cameras (which means a better quality and high-resolution image)...Full HD video and interchangeability of lenses are particularly attractive to wannbe videographers (especially in a sub-$1000 DSLR... like the T3i)... because NOW they can shoot amazing HD video footage for a fraction of the what it would have cost... just a few years ago... PLUS they end up with a great camera for still photography...The Canon T3i (600D) ships with the body, battery, battery charger, USB interface cable, AV cable, EOS solution disk (that contains the really handy EOS utility - I'll talk about this a bit more later...) and a suitable strap (although I quickly replaced mine). AND if you desire... a kit lens...The T3i is considered a compact DSLR at 5.2 inches wide, 3.9 inches high and 3.1 inches deep (not including a lens)... compared to the larger and more expensive 60D at 5.69 inches wide, 4.17 inches high and 3.09 inches deep.The T3i is very similar in size, weight and features to the less expensive T2i. The T3i feels solid and well made and is comfortable in the hand...But I do have smaller hands... So if your hands are larger you may want to look to the 60D OR grab the Zeikos battery, power grip... for your T3i...with an additional battery...This battery grip doubles the amount of shooting you can do between battery changes AND provides a much large grip surface.At the heart of the Canon T3i is an 18 megapixel CMOS digital sensor and the DIGIC 4 processor. This sensor and processor are also found in Canon's 60D and T2i.The camera has one SD card slot that can take a regular SD, SDHC or SDXC card... The T3i does not ship with a card. So plan on adding that to your your list.I highly recommend using nothing less than a class 10 SDHC card for with this camera, especially if you want to shoot HD video.  Even if you don't, you'll want a fast card when shooting continuous photos at 18 mega pixels. I personally like 32 GB cards because they are pretty cheap now and give you enough room to shoot photos all day. Plus 32 giga bites is large enough to hold almost 2 hours of HD video.The T3i has what Canon calls 'Live View Shooting'...which provides a very accurate simulation of photos and video using the LCD screen... This is especially helpful when doing a video shoot without a separate field monitor.The 3 inch variable angle LCD monitor is bright enough for shooting in full sun... and can be flipped so that if lays flat against the camera back or can be positioned at various angles for high and low shooting.But remember... as with any camera-powered monitor, it will consume your batteries faster when you are using it. Brightness also effects battery consumption (which can be adjusted in the camera's setup menu). That being said, the flip and twist capabilities of this monitor make it a priceless asset for videographers and creative photographers.One of the major differences between the T3i and the 60D is it's continuous shooting speed of 3.7 frames per second verse the 60Ds 5.3 frames per second.For me, this was not an issue as I purchased my T3i primarily for shooting video. But if you like to shoot action, you may want to consider the 60D.The controls of the T3i are easy to access with the thumb and four finger.  And are pretty easy to master with little effort... I do suggest keeping the manual near as it will prove a valuable asset and will save frustration as your skills progress.One thing that really impressed about this camera was a real world example of how easy it is for a beginner to get professional results, with this camera... out of the box.One day my son... who has never used a DSLR camera before, went on a walk with my new T3i. When he came back I could tell from his face that he experienced something really special. His big smile made me very curious to see his photos.I was amazed at the stunning images this camera enabled him to capture... as he simply used the camera's scene 'intelligent auto mode' and the dial-selectable 'creative zone modes.'When you select a different dial mode, the camera shows a short and helpful description of that mode. This feature can accelerate your progress and help to quickly hone in on a mode that is best suited for the type of shooting you are doing.My son's experience helped me realize what a fantastic job Canon did skinning over this formidable professional-level camera... with a simple and easy to use point-and-shoot-like interface... that enables the novice (like my son) to achieve very satisfying results.I am convinced that results are one of the reasons that owners rate this camera MUCH higher (close to 5 out of 5 stars) than professional reviewers who usually rate this camera at less than 4 out of 5 starts... and tend to nit pick about technical details and specifications.I'm not saying that specs are not important... but what I am saying is that, at the end of the day... all that matters is that you have good quality photos and videos to show for your effort, regardless of your experience level.The T3i allows you to easily select and scroll between ISO 100 (for well-lit scenes) to ISO 6400 for lower lighting scenarios.Photo quality generally looks great up through ISO 800 and begins to show some small signs of degradation from ISO 1,600 on.The little scrolling wheel toward the front of the camera makes selection of a variety of functions... including ISO... really easy.The 9-pt autofocus systems is accurate and quick for photos... but does struggle in very low light situations.The T3i camera does have the ability to autofocus while you are shooting video... but often takes a few seconds to refocus focus...Plus the noise of the camera while focusing.... will likely be heard in your video. You will also find that the battery life will deplete rapidly when autofocusing a lot during a video.All this being said, the T3i's video autofocus is pretty useless. Fortunately there are plenty of other great reasons to like this camera...As with most cameras these days the T3i includes optical image stabilization that works well... with off-hand shooting.The T3is battery life is generally good... however, battery life is so subjective and is very dependent on how you shoot, the brightness of your LCD screen...  and things like... whether you are using autofocus or not...For shooting photos, I have found the battery life to be excellent allowing me to take 400 to 600 shots before needed a change.Shooting video will consume your batteries at a much more rapid rate if you are using the camera's LCD screen to monitor your video.So I would recommend that you pick up a few additional batteries. I have found a very inexpensive, after-market brand... that have proven to be just as reliable as the OEM battery that came with this camera. See my YouTube Review for more info on the accessories that I mention in this review...And if you want to seriously extend the battery life of this camera (which is especially useful on location during a video shoot)... you should pick up the Zeikos Battery Power Grip for this camera that I mentioned earlier.This is a high quality accessory that matches the camera in look and feel in every way and is less pricy than Canon's version.It easily and securely attaches to the camera and has a removable tray that allows you to power the camera with 2 batteries instead of one.This grip also comes with an additional tray that allows you to use 6 double A batteries to power the camera in a pinch. This is a great safety net for those involved in remote shooting... away from a power source.If you don't want to be limited by batteries, Canon offers a DC power unit. There is a battery sized coupler that you simply insert into the battery port to power the camera by plugging it into a wall outlet.For this accessory, I would only recommend the Canon brand.One nice feature for those who wear corrective lenses (like me)... is the quality dioptric adjustment knob for the camera view finder.This knob allows for plus and minus adjustments to ensure that you see things clearly through the view finder. Although this feature is common in many DSLRs... I was glad to find out that the T3i had it after the fact...The T3i has a built-in mono microphone that sounds pretty good for general video shooting and includes an effective wind filter that can be toggled on and off in the camera's setup.However, for serious video production I recommend that you use a quality external microphone to capture your audio. I use a Zoom H4N for a large range of purposes and really affordable Audio Technica lapel mics for shooting interviews and promotional videos. A Rode shotgun mic is another that you may want to consider.On the side of the T3i there is a 1/8 inch stereo mic input. With the appropriate adapters you can send audio from 2 different mics directly into the camera's left and right channels. The camera allows you for manual adjustment of the record levels which is very useful.There are several other camera ports which include... A remote control terminal. I picked up a very affordable timer remote that I use often for time lapse videos and low light situations.There's digital audio / video out terminal and a mini HDMI out terminal this is great for using an external field monitor or hooking your camera up to your HD TV.The SD card slot is on the other side and the battery compartment in easily accessible on the bottom of the camera.When it comes to video the T3i really shines. It offers full HD video at 1920 by 1080 pixels at 30, 25 and 24 frames per second... on the high end... and also offers 1280 x 720 pixels at 60 frames per second (which is nice for slow motion) as well as 640 x 480 at 30 frames per second.You can get exceptional results from this camera with a little attention to detail and by experimenting with the automatic and manual video settings... and by trying different lenses.For low lighting situations, you may want to consider picking up a Canon 50mm F1.8 lens. It's been dubbed 'plastic magic' because it captures surprisingly good quality photos and video for a a lens with a street price that hovers around $100.The T3i also offers a 3x and 10x digital zoom that produces amazingly crisp video in movie mode.The camera also has a new video snapshot feature that takes short clips of video and stitches them together. It's a fun feature for walking around town and shooting short video clips or having some fun at a party.There's one VERY important aspect of shooting video with most DSLRs, and in our case, the T3i that you should be aware of.To protect the camera from internal heat generated when shooting video... the T3i will stop recording video when the file size of a single movie clip reaches 4GB.This means that if you are shooting in FULL HD that your maximum record time will be  around 10 to 14 minutes. This can be a bit annoying yet, it's easy enough to restart the video.... and if you only need to shoot clips shorter than 10 minutes you will probably never experience this issue.However this function can be problematic in situations where you need to shoot longer lengths of video, like at a conference, a sporting event, or a church sermon.One very helpful surprise that Cannon includes for free with this camera is the EOS utility software. With this software, the T3i, a reasonably modern computer (I use my MacBook Pro... 2010 vintage) and the included digital interface cable... you can extend the use of your laptop computer as a field monitor and command central for the camera.You can remotely control all important camera functions from within the very intuitive interface of this program.The EOS utility functions well for both photo and video shooting and provides a very nice simulation of what you will get...  This bonus has been particularly helpful to me for shooting video since it eliminated the need to purchase a $1,000 field monitor. Note though, that using the EOS utility will deplete your camera and laptop batteries faster than you would think. So I recommend plugging in your laptop and having a few extra batteries for your camera of getting the Canon DC coupler and power unit.The camera also has a very useful built-in flash that will automatically pop up when needed or can be accessed manually with the touch of a button.For more advanced photographers... the T3i supports the latest developments in wireless flash photography.SO who is this camera for?The T3i is best suited for those who want an easy to use, fast, reliable high-end prosumer DSLR that shoots incredible 18 mega pixel photos and FULL HD video... all in compact package for well under $1,000.If you plan on doing a lot of high speed photography you may want to consider the 60D for it's faster 5.3 frame per second continuous shooting... which is the only real major difference between the two. However this upgrade will cost you between $300 and $400.Also... if you want to save some money and don't really need the flip and turn LCD screen of the T3i... you many want to consider the T2i. This will save you around $100....I will caution you though...  if you ever think that you are going to want to shoot video, macro-zoom photographs or anything at high or low angles... you may be sorry that you didn't get the T3i with it's flippy screen.The T3i is also NOT for you if you want a compact, carry-in-your pocket camera to take with you everywhere... Even though the T3i is compact compared to many larger DSLRs... it's not small... So... if your main purpose is finding a camera to document life and have with you at all time... the T3i is probably not the camera for you.Also... If you want to eliminate your camcorder with the T3i, look somewhere else... that's not what the T3i is purposed for. It lacks seamless autofocus in video mode and is not as easy convenient to set up and use as many mini-camcorders.However, if you have a creative flair and want to shoot HD quality video productions, the T3i will help you get off to a great start.All this aside the Canon EOS Rebel T3i is an amazingly popular, all-around DSLR camera... which is evidenced by the fact that... at the time of this video review... the T3i is the #1 best selling DSLR on Amazon.The Canon T3i is an impressive value rivaling the Canon 60D in just about every way... and with it's full HD video, easy-to-use interface, exceptional 18 mega pixel image quality, large flip-and-turn LCD screen and a full set of professional functions... The T3i is a great place to jump into the wonderful world of DSLR photography and video... all for an astonishingly low street price of less than $800.VIEW MY FULL T3i VIDEO REVIEW with Test Video, Sample Photos and Time Lapse Video on YouTube by Searching '2012 T3i Best DSLR'Enjoy!""

This is the very first Canon that we've owned as I had previously been either a Sony or a Nikon dedicated camera consumer.  My teen son wanted a new DSLR camera so I told him to do the research and see which camera he'd like to get.  It came down to the Sony Alpha a55 or the Canon T3i, both about the same price on most sites.  I gave him a few extra days to research the camera and after reading whatever review he could find, he decided on the Canon.  I researched online the different sites, packages, etc., and Amazon offered the best for the least amount - two great cameras lenses with the body, and with Amazon, FREE shipping (via FedEx) and no state tax.  Quite a deal!  The best feature, of course, is the camera itself - there is absolutely no comparison between the Sony we have (about a year old) and the Canon - no comparison whatsoever.

"20120116","5.0","Great Camera","So I'm new to the whole SLR camera world.  I need to take some classes to find out how this camera really works.  I like it because it does have an auto mode where I was able to take it out of the box and pretty much shoot in auto mode right away.  I was suprise to find out that on SLR camera's, unless shooting in auto mode, you have to manually focus the leanse and you are the one moving to zoom in and out, not the lense.  Oh well, live and learn, but this should be fun!""

"20120113","5.0","Dead pixel at first but fixed","I ordered this T3i with both the 18-55mm and 55-250mm lenses and when the camera arrived it had a dead pixel right in the middle of every photo and video I shot. I thought it was the lens or the sensor so I cleaned both and still the same spot. After contacting Amazon about the defective camera they immediately replaced the same order with an overnight shipping which is awesome so I received a new camera with the same lenses the next day. Canon is one of the greatest if not the best camera manufacturer ever and everyone knows the name but the dead pixel was kind of disappoint. Of course the mass manufacture their cameras and hand make their lenses so there are some cameras that will have a defect out of the millions they make and I am happy with the new camera that I received. Great sensor and great video mode since I will be mainly using it to film with a shoulder rig.""
"20120113","5.0","Great DSLR","Easy to use, took great pictures. Much better picture quality than the T1i which I gave to my kid. Video auto focus is not as good as traditional video camera. So video sometime is out of focus even it look clear in small screen.""
"20120111","5.0","First DSLR purchase....couldn't be any happier","I purchased this camera with both the kit lens (18-55mm) and 55-250mm lens from Canon. I am very pleased with the picture quality. Mostly, I have used this camera for taking pictures at youth soccer games.  Using the 55-250mm lens, I was impressed by how close I could get to the action and have gotten many amazing action photos. The cameras abilities were good enough to freeze the action for nice crisp pictures. The 3.7fps speed is very helpful for making sure I don't miss an important moment. I know it does not take sports photos as well as professional cameras, but I feel it certainly does a great job for the money! I have not yet tried it in indoor lighting. I also took some pictures of a social event I attended (using the 18-55mm lens)and the 18 megapixels really helps the people in the photos to stand out and look sharp. The camera was also quite easy to figure out how to use. I spent maybe 30 minutes browsing through the manual and another 30 minutes or so watching some tutorials and I felt comfortable with pretty much every setting on the camera. An excellent purchase!""
"20120110","5.0","Can't possibly say enough good things about this camera!","I haven't even had a month with the T3i yet and already I can tell it was money VERY well spent. As many of you are probably doing now, I had to decide which brand, then which model to pick. It was a tough choice, for the longest time I was trying to decide between the Nikon D3100 and the Canon T2i, but for just a little bit more, you get a nice flip-out high resolution screen, remote flash firing, and a few other goodies with the T3i. I'm not a photographer. In fact, I had absolutely no interest in photography until just recently. This is my first DSLR camera, and it's perfect for me. it has enough settings and features so I won't become easily bored, or 'grow out' of it, yet it has a great feature guide that tells you what each mode should be used for (fully customizable of course). The 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilized (IS) Kit lens that it comes with is perfect for getting used to the camera. It's good for those relatively close up group shots, or portraits. Even very small subjects can be brought into focus with this lens. And when your'e ready to upgrade, the 55-250mm IS lens is very reasonably priced (that's what I plan to get next anyway). I would recommend getting a SanDisk Extreme SD card to go with this (at least 8gb). OH! one last thing, the HD movie mode. That was another huge selling point for this camera. Although the Nikon D3100 AND the Canon T2i both have 1080p HD video recording, they do NOT have inputs for an external microphone. For some this might not be a big deal at all, but it's always a nice thing to have if you should want to dabble in the cinematography world in the future.Overall, GREAT camera, I would recommend it to anyone.""

"20120107","5.0","Switching dSLR  systems and glad I did","Wife and kids allowed me to get this (from them) for XMAS with the two lens kit (18-55/55-250 and I added the nifty fifty - EF 50mm f1.8 II).  I've been used to working with Olympus over the years and what they are asking for their lone dSLR body was too much.  I love Zuiko glass, but Oly seems to be focusing on the mirrorless system (m4/3) and that is not for me... not comfortable on large hands and I a don't like EVIL viewfinder.  A system change was in order and it was between the Nikon D5100 and the Canon EOS600D/T3i.  Both systems were impressive when I toyed with them at a camera shop, but the Canon's menu system was better and the grip felt better in my hands.  Getting it into the gym to snap photos of my kids travel ball team was a blast.  Both times I used the 50mm and loved every minute of it.  I had more good shots than I could have gotten with my older Oly that was never good at indoor shots in a big open gym.  Next up, tried video.  I really never thought I would have much use for it but WOW, was I ever impressed.  While the focus ring on the 50mm f1.8 is small, the control I got with it was amazing.  I see myself using this more than I imagined.  Might have to add a 28mm f1.8 at some point.Now I don't want to slam Oly and I do plan on holding on to one of my bodies and a handful of the incredible Zuiko ED glass, but for a system switch this was a great move for me.  When the weather warms up, I'll try the 55-250 at some casual birding.If I had a con, the 18-55... don't like the manual focus ring for my big hands and Olympus kit lenses were better overall when I had them.  But I may pick-up the 18-135 as my typical walk around lens.  I really can't complain much over the image quality with it though for a kit lens.""
"20120105","5.0","Great pictures!","Purchased for my daughters photo class. She was taking great pictures within minutes of opening the box. Easy to use. Picture quality it great. Would definately recommend it.""
"20120105","5.0","Great camera!","This is a wonderful, easy to use camera camera. I personally hate reading instructions and with this camera I didn't really need to. All of the functions are either clearly labeled or are easy to figure out, so far I have only had to look up one item in the manual. I have used a Rebel XT in the past and the T3i is a vast improvement. Also, Amazon sold this camera for $100-$200 less than anywhere else I looked. Very pleased customer.""
"20120105","5.0","Great camera and lens kit","I bought this camera as an upgrade from a previous Canon digital SLR.  I am an advanced user but by no means a professional.

"20120104","5.0","An Amazing Camera","Canon does it again.I owned the T2i for about a year and used it to take pictures at concerts. It was a great camera. When I saw this camera, I got it thinking that it would be better. This camera exceeded my expectations. I have used both cameras at the same time to see the difference. This camera is SO MUCH BETTER. It adjusts to the lighting around me so much better than the t2i and the moving screen is perfect for taking video, since sometimes to get a great shot you need to put the camera in different positions. The microphone is amazing and HD video is spectacular.It is a great camera for beginners since this camera explains what each mode setting does. This camera was worth every cent and more.""
"20120104","5.0","Amazing","I was nervous that this camera wouldn't be worth the price. Photography is just a hobby of mine. I love taking pictures, but I don't do it for money so I thought this camera would be perfect for me. My pictures are amazing. They're all in focus. I did notice that if you use the AF at all, it's best to use the viewfinder instead of the screen. For some reason, the camera doesn't seem to focus as well when you use the screen. I don't mind that. I always use the viewfinder anyway. In short, I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!""

Also picked up the Battery Grip to add more shooting capabilities as well as the additional size to make it more manageable and get the additional button on the side to take portrait photos without having to force my hands into an uncomfortable position.

I have never had any camera that took portraits that I liked using the on camera flash or a flash attached to the hotshoe, including my film SLR.  This Canon T3i DOES!!  I love this camera!""
"20120601","2.0","Really wanted to like this camera","I really wanted to like this camera. I really did.When it functioned correctly, it took some very good photos. However, for video; this thing is sadly lacking. For one thing, it would constantly overheat; even when being used in an air conditioned space. It could never record more than 6-8 minutes of 1080 video  without overheating. Attempted to record a school concert, what recordings were obtained; were awful.Images taken, quickly become grainy when the light is anything less than optimum.From my viewpoint, the menu system is too cumbersome. With large hands, it was difficult to hold and use the camera. It was awkward to access the various wheels and buttons.The screen was difficult to view while outside. ANY glare rendered it completely useless. Used inside, you have to shift your head or screen to find the right angle for viewing. Even then it was often hard to read.Barreling was noted in some test images. An image with a flag pole against a bright blue and slightly cloudy sky turned the flagpole  into an arc rather than straight line.The auto focus would function adequately for pictures, but only with absolutely optimum lighting. When you shoot video; you could never get the image crisp using either auto or manual focus. Even when you mange to get the subject crisp, any panning quickly resulted in blurred and/or soft images. If you prefer to shoot video with all in focus, forget about the included 18 - 55 mm lens. It was painful to try and manually focus this lens and of course the auto focus never worked correctly.It's probable the unit tested was defective. But unwilling to risk an exchange, the camera was promptly returned for refund.I've generally had satisfactory experiences with canon products, however; this one failed to meet my needs, expectations and preferences. My advice would be to try before purchasing. This one could quickly turn into an expensive mistake.""

"20120524","5.0","Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP Digital SLR Camera","I was not a photo enthusiast like some of the reviewers who were seasoned to the 'DSLR' terminologies and technology and I can associate with the few that have come from the 'point & shoot' camera experience & the typical knowledge gained through this type of interaction.My choice to move to a DSLR was not an easy one but what I can say is that I had to do some homework like some of the buyers from which I would have been previewed to two names having made their mark in the DSLR photography world being Canon and Nikon. The pros and cons of which I would not go into because the fact remains in the ultimate choice of a person and in the finances they have at their disposal sine both these brands have similar features with '+s and -s' in their own distinctive categories over which they have ruled and still improving on respectively.What I can say from my interaction and use of the camera has improved my photos tremendously and this is mostly in part to the extended and fully capable feature set of this camera. It has been a great introductory DSLR experience for me and this is what I can base my recommendation on and it has only served to improved my thirst for creating better images which has led me to researching materials and training videos to get my skill set up to scratch.I bought the camera with the standard EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens and it is a great learning lens for beginners I can definitely see myself progressing to other high-powered lens as I immerse further into the DSLR world and image photography. All with the ultimate goal of transforming what the eyes see on a daily basis into photography, capturing the moment in time and translating it into a story that can be felt by many through their own eyes.I will definitely recommend this camera to those who want to take the bold leap into the DSLR photography world, I can assure you that you will be amazed....""

"20120521","4.0","Good Camera for the Price!","This is a really great camera and the pictures come out very clear with the stock 18-55 mm lens. If you have the camera on auto everything it does a really good job at well doing everything automatically. If you are on manual it is also pretty easy to use, but if your in a rush just use auto. The only reason why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the movie mode has 1 major flaw like most dslr cameras do. The one thing I dislike is the noise it makes when you are autofocusing. This noise is heard in your video unless you buy an external microphone. If you already have an external mic then this is a really good 5 star camera :D Will so recommend this to anyone looking for an entry level dslr camera.""
"20120519","5.0","Awesome","First time DSLR buyers might be a little scared at first when they start playing around with this camera. But once you get the hang if it, you will not want to use the Basic Controls, instead you will use the Advanced Controls all the time.  The pictures are stunning and the option to add a slave flash were a plus for me. If you want to buy this camera as your first DSLR I recommend it 100%.  If you have a little more knowledge of DSLR's then you are better off with the Canon 60D or 7D.""

"20111231","5.0","Top of the pack, picked T3i over 60D, a55, D5100 and love it","We compared the T3i head to head against the Nikon D5100.  In full auto mode, the T3i beats the Nikon.  They are probably identical in the hands of a pro using manual settings, but in auto the D5100 has lousy white balance and notable motion blur.Then we compared the T3i head to head against the D5100, the Sony Alpha 55, and the Canon 60D.  Found the 60D to be too heavy, and that the 18-135mm lens is also too heavy and cumbersome.  I really liked the fixed mirror of the Sony and continuous phase autofocus in live view and movie mode.  But the snapshots of the T3i were slightly better.  With the shortcomings of the a55, it is probably a tier lower and thus overpriced.  I think we'd have bought the a77 over the T3i if both were $700 for the body and 18-55mm kit.The T3i excels under low light, the whole point of moving up from a point and shoot.  It was hard to not go with a mirrorless or fixed mirror system, but the T3i had the best pictures, simple as that.  After taking about 600 pictures in the last few days, had to learn a little about the semi-auto features.  Very useful are setting white balance to scene instead of using auto or a preset, and using portrait mode for indoor shots and putting the flash up or down as desired.  Also find shutter priority mode helpful to get shots without motion blur, and also like locking max auto ISO to 1600 or 800 for lower noise.The bottom line is that we get extremely natural looking photos taken indoors at night without flash.  I took pictures in dim tungsten lighting that look like they were taken in the afternoon with indirect sunlight coming in the windows.  Amazing--why we bought the camera and why it gets 5 stars.Also bought the Tamron 18-200mm zoom lens and the Rode Videomic Pro as accessories--both of those earn 5 stars, too.We purchased the T3i and the Tamron lens online from B&H who has a no-hassle return policy.""

I went to take a picture and it said the contacts needed to be cleaned and there was a communication error between the camera and the lens. It's brand new and the contacts are bright and clean. A quick Google search and apparently it's a known common issue. There were tutorials on how to fix it but it takes 45 minutes if you know what you're doing. Since it is brand new and under warranty I figured I'd just send it in for repair. This is where I got annoyed the second time. I haven't had to send too many things in for warranty repair in the past but I feel like they should have paid for the shipping. Instead the 'shipping label' I was supposed to print wasn't a shipping label as much as an address that I printed on a piece of paper. The instructions said to mail it to that address with my choice of carrier. So it ended up costing me $8 to mail and insure it. $8 in the grand scheme of things is not a huge deal, however I seem to remember getting a shipping label for anything that was broken under warranty in the past, but it has been a while, maybe things are different these days.""

Also, could not access the menu or get any displays on the screen. Called Canon support, by the way was very good, after a few words the support person said  it had a problem. The way the support person knew of this problem, sounded to me this was a common failure. Was recommended to send it back.  Now I have questions as to whether to purchase a Canon if the quality assurance at Canon is performing their jobs.""

"20111227","5.0","Great Camera For The Money","I received this camera as a Christmas present.  I already have the Canon T1i and have used it and loved it and thought that it would take a lot to beat it but the T3i has.  Using the kit lens from my T1i which is basically the same lens available with the T3i I took fantastic low light shots of my daughter's Christmas tree without a flash.  I used the 'P' setting with auto ISO and was very happy with the results.  I used a Tamaron 18-270 MM lens to take some low light shots of my house and the Christmas lights and again was amazed at the results.  Noise levels at even high ISO are very minimal and can be cleaned up with a good editing program.  I have yet to explore all the features of this camera or use the HD video feature but if it is as good as the results I have already seen, it will be amazing.  I am retired and have taken up digital photography as a hobby and while I am no expert or even close, I do consider myself to be an informed amateur and always research any camera before purchase so when I received this from my wife without my input I was a bit surprised but seeing the results very very happy.  The camera can be used by someone new to a DSLR with great results and I am sure that someone who is familiar with all the bells and whistles this camera has will produce amazing results.  I used the T1i while my friend used a Canon 1D and I feel my pictures where as good as his despite that the 1D is a superior camera so I am sure that the T3i will produce even better results.  I would recommend that any person interested in a great DSLR purchase this camera.  I also suggest that while the kit lens does a great job you invest in at least one good zoom lens that will expand your ability to take fantastic pictures.""

"20111226","5.0","Worth The Money - Outstanding Images","I've had my T3i for six months now, and so far I'm extremely pleased with my results.  I'd call myself at least a semi-professional, having had 10 different digital camera since my first (a Kodak DC120 that cost $1,000) in 1998, including a number of Nikons and Canons.  There are some very long reviews on this site for the T3i, so I'll spare you the details.  But, I take lots of different digital images (over 6,000 since April with this camera), from action photos of our grandchildren playing in their basketball and volleyball games to macrophotographs (using a Canon 100mm macro)of flowers and other organisms, and I'm almost always amazed by the results - images are sharp and colors are right on.  And a number of times folks around me looking at the results have commented on 'how amazing' the images are.  Videos have also been lots of fun to take, although the learning curve for getting good video is a little steeper than for still images.  And honestly, if I were going to take very much video, I'd get a dedicated video camera.  This camera, as one might expect, is very versatile, and the important lesson I learned early on is to read the book and go to the internet for advice on how to get the most out of it - some fantastic information there.  Practice, experiment, practice, experiment, etc., and not surprisingly, the more you do the better images you'll get. Common sense I know, but it is tempting and easy to simply set the camera on Scene Intelligent Auto setting and click away, expecting the best (and actually getting a lot when you do).  I rarely use that setting, choosing rather to mostly use the Program AE mode and customize my image taking to the situation.  I could go on and on, but I don't think you'll be sorry if you get a T3i.  It's worth the money!""

"20111223","5.0","Great upgrade","My 15 year old Sony MVC CD-1000 was swept out of an overhead bin by another passenger's coat on my return from vacation.  I was unable to find a repair shop for such an 'old' camera, so I needed a new one.  My first 'serious' SLR was a Canon AE-1P, so I naturally gravitated to the Canon product line.  I also research the Nikon cameras.  After a quick trip to a local big-box store to compare the feel and weight of the Canon and Nikon offerings, I selected the T3i and couldn't be any happier.  On a recent trip to Europe, the camera operated flawlessly in sun, rain and snow.The auto-focus is superb and it takes only 3 or 4 shots to understand how to use the focus points in the viewfinder and get the image focus where you want it.  The T3I uses the semi-depressed shutter button to preview the focus and also took only a few shots to be able to use it instinctively.Since I only had the camera 10 days prior to my latest trip, I stuck mostly to the A+ (point and shoot) and flash disabled modes.  Despite this, I came back with over 650 pictures, all of far better quality than my old trusty Sony.PROS:- ease of adaptation, within an hour of starting to use it, the camera was instinctively just there';- instruction manual was actually readable - the final editor and proofreaders appear to actually speak English (thank you Canon!);- light weight body;- very good ergonomics - even with my big hands, the buttons and dials do not interfere with each other;- clear LCD display even without my bifocals (showing my age :).CONS:- its taking a lit bit to become comfortable with swapping lenses quickly.  I haven't had to swap lenses for 15 years, so practice will probably get me back to the old AE-1 days;- my old AE-1 lenses don't fit, but they are almost 30 years old, so I'm probably not missing anything.OVERALL IMPRESSION:Again, its a new camera, so it will take 6 months or so of experimenting to get familiar with all the features.  But at first glance, this camera is certainly a 5-star piece of equipment.""

I wanted something small that had similar capabilities. I found it in the Panasonic Lumix range and sold all of my Canon gear.Then my daughter was born. Suddenly my major focus changed from landscape shots to portraits and Kodak moment type snaps of her. This was fine when we were outdoors but compact cameras really struggle in low-light situations. Two months ago, I decided it was time to dive back into the world of digital SLRs. I didn't need too many bells and whistles, just a simple SLR that could take fantastic shots of my daughter and her future siblings.I found it.This EOS is a super camera for the price. I used to pay 4 times as much to get lesser quality in the older cameras in the range. My brother, a professional photographer, has one of the best models in the series and even he is impressed with this basic model's capabilities.The new articulated screen is a good addition as is the ability to take HD video. The camera fills my hand nicely and is easy to hold stable due to the molded back. Th e software, screen menus,and buttons are all familiar and easy to understand. Anyone with previous Canon experience will feel right at home.The best part of all, though, is that I am now producing beautiful photos of my daughter with no effort whatsoever.I would recommend this camera to any new user to digital SLRs or users who want to come back to something bigger than a compact without going overboard.""
"20111222","2.0","Warranty or support, hopefully unneeded.","This is more a review of Canons warranty and support than the camera itself.I bought the T3i + kit from Amazon late in August 2011.  My T3i camera will occasionally take pictures with compression lines running vertically through the picture.  This is about 1 in 10 pictures.  It is sort of like looking through wavy privacy glass.  I have lost critical wedding photos to this.So far over the course of 3 weeks trying to get a repair from the manufacturer Canon has blamed my laptop card reader, my workstation usb port, Windows 7 picture importer, Picasa picture importer, Lightroom picture importer, my class 10 SD card, my new class 10 SD card, My very newest professional 35mb/s SD card, and low batteries.  I have been run through multiple camera resets and I have actually been hung up on.  I have always been calm and professional when talking to support on the phone.Finally after multiple calls to Canon support they agreed to check the camera.  Now I have to ship it to Canons repair center paying for shipping and they will be keeping my camera for 10 business days for in house repair plus shipping times both ways.  There is no guarantee of fixing the problem or of swapping out my camera.  They actually stated on the phone that the 10 days could be longer as it is a busy time for them.  I am waiting to send it to them after years end as I do not want to be without a camera during Christmas two of my children's birthdays and New Year's. 1 in 10 bad photos is better than zero photos.  Canon will not advance replace cameras.I think if I had received a fully working camera this would be a 5 star review.  Instead I have to work with very poor customer support for a fairly expensive purchase.  I deal with Dell, HP, Microsoft and Cisco customer support at my work every day and Canon has by far the worst support or warranty I have had to deal with in recent memory.Hopefully your purchase will not need the support or warranty and you can simply enjoy a good product.  Personally, I will be looking to other companies when it is time to get a new camera.""

The clarity of the pictures are superb. There is one little thing that I would have to say needs improvement and that would be the flash. After a few pictures using the flash, the flash would take a few seconds, maybe a minute to reload. The camera will show you that the flash is busy. But besides that, everything is exceeds my expectations. It's a great camera especially for the price. Oh, by the way, the video is excellent. It's very easy to switch between camera and video mode.

The camera is easy to use straight out of the box, or you can spend days learning all of the options and abilities of this camera.  It takes decent video, but it takes some time to get use to the clunky video controls.  The different scene options help for us who are just starting out, and the automatic setting is great for those who don't want to learn about the camera's manual side.  Overall great first DSLR.

I really love the live view the T3i has.I have made several purchases from Amazon and have always received prompt service and received the merchandise on or before it was promised.Yes, I would definitely reccommend this purchase to anyone.""
"20111214","5.0","Astonishing Camera! Beautiful features!","I love Canon! I have had a few cameras before this one including a few 14 megapixel cameras and this by far blew them out of the water. The clarity and the range that this camera gave me was like no other camera that I have had before. There are a few reasons that I would equate this camera with the best on the market but I cannot say it in only one sentence so here it goes; the good first, then the bad.PROS:First of all the QUALITY that you get for your money when it comes to Canon products is by far the best deal that you will get when it comes to excellent camera equipment. I bought an SLR from Nikon a few year back thinking that the saving would come in handy. However I did not expect the camera to have so many problems! Automatic focus would never work correctly, the white balance was always atrocious even after I would fix it continuously. It just seems like anything that could go wrong went wrong with that camera. That is why now I SWEAR BY THE SUPERIOR QUALITY OF CANON. The last 3 cameras I have owned have been Canon and I willnever go back.Enough with Canon, now this specific camera. The 18.0 MP CMOS sensor was definitely a step up for me. You could see the difference in high-fidelity when it came to the HD images. I was blown away by the processor speed as well. You rarely had to wait more than a few seconds in between shots and the DIGIC lived up to its hype among enthusiasts.The ISO which is denoting the realized speed was AWESOME. Not only was it versatile but the bright to dim modifications that you could change in the setting really set this camera apart in my opinion.This thing is FAST! I love it when electronic equipment can work at the same pace as my brain does, when I am taking pictures the last thing I want to think about is waiting on the camera to finish loading. Not with this. Canon got this right, this could also have a lot to do with the new innovative processor.I had been looking to invest in a camera for a long time. I love taking my camera out at the most inopportune moments and taking pictures of things that no one else would see the art behind. I was really inspired by my sister's camera choice a year back. She chose the Canon EOS but it was a different model then the one here.Another thing that I loved about this camera was the SCREEN SIZE! I love a big screen when I take pictures, it helps me put a scene or object into perspective better in my mind. Don't ask me why or how, it just does. By being able to see the picture that I took on such a large screen, I also can see what I need to improve in the picture and what I need to keep the same.Also, keeping with the screen, the menu options were so simple! I am a guy so the last thing I want to do is open up a manual but this thing to into account people of all skill levels!Speaking of pictures! THIS CAMERA TAKES EXTRAORDINARY PICTURES! Was cap locks necessary? Yes it was. Obviously your thinking, umm, yes of course this camera would take good pictures with the price your paying for it. But as I have looked around online this price point isn't too bad in relation to some other sites online.STARTLING VIDEO QUALITY! Ok I love to talk about this feature of the camera because I love the video camera on this camera. First off, a few weeks back there was an interview with the Japanese CEO of Canon asking him why Canon was seemingly breaking into the video industry when they were already the front-runner in quality when it came to still photography. He said that Canon would like to experiment with adding their quality into the video sector of the industry. Now if I was Sony I would be scrambling to get my cards together because if Canon starts breaking into the video industry you can guarantee that Sony is going to lose a lot of capital with their main competitor increasing their inventory capabilities. When asked if Canon would ever give up its still camera quality to pursue video the CEO said without hesitation that there is no way that Canon would ever stop innovating and improving their cameras. That is there roots and what has made them great and they will never give that up. This is good news for all you purists out there that just want to take beautiful pictures and leave the video to Hollywood and family time.CONS:DSLR's are BIG! Yes, I know, you didn't see that coming did you? Well, it's true and it definitely rears its head when you are at a amusement park or on a long trip and you have to haul your camera around everywhere with you. This isn't such a bad thing when you're going somewhere, like a wedding, to specifically take pictures but it can be definitely a hindrance when you're trying to move fast. If this doesn't bother you then more power to you, it bothers me. However, I knew how big this camera was when I got it and I still got it because the PROS DEFINITELY OUTWAY THE CONS IN MY OPINION. Also, if you have children around then I say BE CAREFUL. My kids almost broke this camera a few times which would have been a horrible thing.  Just make sure if you're going to buy this camera that it fits your lifestyle or you can conform that to fit your camera.The battery life is pretty short on this. I love to take a lot of pictures, upload them online and then edit them or delete depending on how good they are. This battery life was a little hard to do that with because you need to prioritize which pictures you want uploaded before the battery shuts off. This may seem like a pretty bad thing to some but once you have a routine down, like I do now, then it generally gets easier to gauge how much battery life you need to do certain things.These two things are probably the biggest things that I would criticize about this camera. This camera is as close to perfect as its going to get, on a budget, in my opinion.Summary:Life is about give and take and I believe this camera takes the least for your money.  I would love to tell you about every single little detail that I love or hate about this camera but I have told you the most important things in my opinion. Feel free to critique anything I said if you don't agree or post questions in the reply if you want more information, I would love to tell you. I have had this for about 4 months now and I will never go back to a point and shoot, this camera is the real deal and I give it a 5 starts easily.Happy buying!!""
"20111214","3.0","not for amateurs","I got tired of point and  shoots where a tiny movement or shade ruin the photos,and are very slow, especially since I use the camera to photograph my children indoors. Bought this camera, my first SLR, without any knowledge in photography. The camera is user friendly for the automatic mode, but I find that the automatic mode isn't much of an improvement from a regular P&S: colors aren't great, camera is slow to focus, moving kids- pictures far from great. For the cost of 4 good P&S cameras, I would expect MUCH better pictures.  Either I take a course in photography, for which I definitely I don't have time, or take it back to the store, save some money and keep getting mediocre photographs with a cheaper P&S.Another minus- got the lenses that come with the kit 18-55 and 55-250. The 55-250 doesn't shoot people that are close (you get the whole surroundings), but the 15-55 isn't enough zoom. Exchanging lenses in the middle of taking photographs- not doable (then you miss the picture you wanted, which was the idea of buying an SLR). Have to get some lens that covers more (such as 18-200). I understand now that if you want good photos, you really have to get into it, not for everybody.""
"20111214","5.0","Great for Student Film-Forays","I'm enamored with this little guy.  I picked one up after doing a volunteer PA gig on a film crew this summer.  For a student, or anyone on a budget, the quality on this thing is magnificent.  I've put mine through some pretty sketchy situations (like duck taping it to the foot rest of a motor scooter, driving at speed) and it's held up well.  The on-board microphone is garbage, though, you can line in external recorder through the 1/8'' input.  The interface is deep enough to gain an understanding of the camera while retaining beginner's level simplicity. I've heard a lot of people complain about the kit lens, but you can compensate for it with a little meticulosity and composition skill.  You don't need thousands of dollars in glass to take reasonably good shots.""

"20111213","5.0","Works great for what I got it for!","I needed a camera to both take professional quality pictures and record at full HD 1080. I am a published author and am currently writing my next how-to book on balloon twisting. The publisher wants to do ebook versions with video embedded, so I needed to find a reasonably priced way to create both pictures and videos for the ebooks. So far any fault with the video and pictures has more to do with my knowledge (or lack thereof) of good studio lighting and proper lenses for proper settings. The camera itself works great. Both the video and pictures are sharp. I read reviews on the camera and so got an external microphone to plug into the camera rather than using the built in one. Also the veri-angle LCD screen is great for being able to frame myself in the shot before starting to record since I'm usually doing these pictures and videos alone. It is definitely a purchase I would make again (but I shouldn't need to for quite a while).""
"20111212","5.0","Very user friendly!","I just got this camera and I'm in love with it!  This is my first DSLR (I have several 35mm SLR) and it is so easy to use.  the menus are self explanatory.  I was suprised by how lightweight it is compared to the Nikon D5100. I'm a Nikon person so the D5100 was my first choice.  I played with my friend's D5100 and I found the menus and settings somewhat confusing compared to the Canon T3i.  I love using it for video too and I love that you can take stills while filming.  I chose the Canon because I already had other Canon lenses and because the price was right.  I was second guessing my choice until I received my camera and was blown away by how great the pictures came out and by the ease of use.""
"20111211","5.0","If you love photos, go for it!","I bought this camera and it is my first SLR.  Always being interested in photography and being somewhat creative I thought that the point-to-shoot area has come to an end.  However, it is of course not a cheap investment - especially when you buy the T3i with the 18-135mm lens.  So you are perhaps wondering - was it worth the money?  And the answer is yes!  Even without getting to creative and playing with the variety of manual settings you can make photos in the auto-modes that will make your point-to-shoot camera photos look like photos taken with a cell phone.  The colors and focus on specific objects give the photos more dynamics.  The different modes allow you to select the right auto-setting for the object you are trying to capture.  The screen info on the T3i helps compared to the T2i (my dad has one) when you are new to such camera.  Overall I am very satisfied.  If you are considering to purchase the T3i, then you should think about getting the 18-135mm lens compared to the 18-55mm lens.  Reason being that the 135mm lens gives you more tele and you can zoom more than with the 55mm introduction lens.  If you are planning to get a tele-lens anyway and want to go higher up (i.e. 300mm), then the 55mm should do it.  However, I know myself and do not want to necessarily change lens depending on the distance of the object and the 135mm seems to be the right fit.""

"20111209","5.0","Just superb","The camera is phenomenal. Rather than buy the somewhat 'bad' kit lens with it, I purchased a used older lens separately, a 28-105 Canon Ultrasonic EF lens. The pictures are very sharp, and using a 16GB class 10 SDHC card, it is more than fast enough for my needs. The camera is capable of correcting for any dust on the lens, but I haven't tried this yet. Overall, the only downside I've seen is my mental association of the Eos Rebel branding with Andr&eacute; Agassi, which is hardly fair to the camera. I'm trying to think of it as a Canon 600D, but not having much luck.""
"20111208","5.0","Upgraded from Canon Digital Rebel xSi","I bought the t3i body because I wanted the ability to shoot video, but didn't want to have to pay for new lenses. I had owned the Rebel xSi for a few years and was able to attach the kit lens and 50mm lens to the new t3i without any problems. It gets the same incredible quality shots as my old camera, but now I can watch them move as well! My old SD cards worked fine for stills, but I did have to buy a larger capacity, faster card for shooting video. The PNY 16GB Class 10 card was my choice and it worked so well, I bought two more. The xSi takes a different battery than the t3i as well, but I still saved money not having to pay for another lens. I have owned many video cameras over the years, and nothing gets as nice a picture as the t3i. Having all the manual controls and focus options of a still camera has made all the difference.""
"20111208","4.0","Excellent for pictures","Excellent for picture , however for video shoot you need to have a superior class memory card. Video will keep shutting down automatically aft 10 sec for need of better memory card.""
"20111207","5.0","Great Camera","I upgraded from the XTi to the T3i.  Great camera!  I could not be more pleased.  I was not sure if the flip out screen was necessary but a recent trip to Disney proved that it was useful.  Holding it above the crowds is now possible.  I upgraded due to my interest in the video capabilities.  I am not 100% thrilled and would not run out to have this to replace a dedicated video camera but it does serve the purpose for the occasional video capture.  It has difficulty focusing but fixed video capture works extremetly well.  If you are reading this to figure out if it is a good camera, I can offer two words..... buy it!""
"20111205","5.0","Awesome!!","Hi,  This would be a good camera for starters in photography. Easy to handle and it gives u a lot of options. The product was good and the packaging was excellent. Thanks to Amazon!!""
"20111203","5.0","Canon T3i","I got the camera body almost overnight and was promised it would arrive in a week to 10 days. I ordered an aftermarket lens by Tamron and I couldn't be happier. I have owned Canons for years and they are always a great mix of latest technology, quality construction, and price.""
"20111202","5.0","Absolutely Great Camera","This camera is fantastic. Construction feels solid, grip feels nice. The kit 18-55 mm lens maybe isn't the best, but you can always buy the body by itself and get a nice prime lens. I'm a student filmmaker, and this camera works great. The swivel screen is great for when I have the camera up on my DIY jib and need to see what I'm looking at. HD video quality is fantastic, even in low light, and it'll only get better with a better lens. I had to film some interviews outside a club in low light, and even at ISO 1600 the noise wasn't distracting, and after a quick denoising pass it wasn't noticeable at all. The camera has an stereo audio input on the side if you don't have an external device to record audio to and, though the camera's weak pre-amp leads to noisier audio, it's definitely still usable. If you're a still photographer and don't need the swivel screen, get the T2i instead. But for filmmakers who want a great camera without have to sell their kidneys, the T3i is freaking sweet.P.S: This camera works with both the CineStyle profile and the Magic Lantern firmware. So. Awesome.""
"20111201","5.0","The Best Deal Out There!","Canon has once again answered the call. This camera has everything you need for most still shooting, and full HD video, at a very affordable price! Like many of the reviewers before me, the kit lens leaves a bit to be desired. It looks good, reacts well, great glass,...but is built cheaper and lighter than the standard lens lineup and feels a bit 'break easy' for use every day. At this pricepoint, however,(I got mine during cyber week) there is flexibility to invest in a better lens. And with casual use the kit lens should last a good while. I'll update if I'm wrong about that!!The vari-angle monitor is very handy and has a crystal clear screen. If your used to Canon this is will familiar ground for you as most controls, and shooting modes, are right where they are supposed to be. Good, fast, AF. Live view. 18mp! In my opinion, definitely the biggest bang for buck out there right now!!!I would suggest reading the hands-on reviews. You'll be impressed.""
"20111201","4.0","Beautiful Quality, Few annoying design qualities","I could go on and on about the picture quality of the DSLR, but I'm sure anyone looking to buy one already knows about all those things.  I will instead focus on the camera itself (the hardware/software) instead of the picture quality, which is SUPERB.PROS:The sheer amount of features allowed is nice.  As my first DSLR, I can only judge this camera against point and shoots.Everything can be tweaked and tuned as expected in a DSLR, but it also has a 'auto' mode, which is nice when you just want to take a quick shot and not have to worry about ISO settings, etc, etc.The shutter itself feels much better than a point and shoot, and the focus time, and the downtime between shots is also WAY lower than the run of the mill point and shoot.A feature I haven't seen as flexible in point in shoot is the timer shots.  You can set it to take anywhere from 1-10 pictures with 1 timer.  This is great for big family photos where you prop the camera up on a tripod and just want to do 10 photos in a row - and hopefully everyone will have their eyes open in one of those 10 photos (especially hard with little kids).CONS:The software/hardware feels sort of undated.  Canon has stuck with this same layout for a long time for continuity, but new point and shoots have a much more streamlined interface.  For example, the wheel on the top (where you switch between modes), does not allow for 360 degree rotation, only like 300 degrees rotation.  This means, for example, if you were in Video Capture mode and wanted to go to Macro Mode, you have to spin the wheel 300 degrees instead of just 60 degrees.The software is one that takes getting used to.  They use a 'tab' system to tell you which settings you are messing with in the Menu.  The tab system may be familiar to long time Canon users, but the way the tabs are labeled sometimes make it confusing.  Instead of using words, they use symbols, which I feel do not match well.  For example, there are 'tabs' with a Wrench icon.  Unless I memorize which setting is where, there is a hard time remember exactly what settings are changed in the 'wrench' tab.The battery must be charged separately from the device.  I don't know if this is a standard for DSLR, but I liked how I could just plug in my camera itself and charge it on point and shoots.Overall:There is no arguing the picture quality, it is basically the same as the T2i, and professional reviews all across the internet rate this as the top entry-level DSLR.  It has settings for a beginner like me, and it has settings for advanced users as well.For those wondering between T2i and T3i, the main difference is a spin-out LCD screen, and digital zoom during video.  These differences are small, and I know I was confused when I first researched this DSLR.  The T2i and T3i are much more similar than the T3 vs T3i.T2i or T3i - Get either, T3/T2 are a lower-end model, they are made for two different budget targets.""
"20111201","5.0","Not Perfect, but Awesome!","I primarily use it for video, but I wanted to take pictures as well.I love the dynamic range of light, takes great video in 1080p and 720p.  I wish that you could have more frame rate options in 720p and I also wish that ISOs above 400 were a little less noisy.The kit lens is nice, but I recommend that you get a larger telephoto lens.  The default auto-focus doesn't work to great in the dark, but the quick auto-focus is nice since it shows you green boxes where it's focused.  It's nice that you can zoom in using the LCD screen so that you can ensure your focus is good, but unfortunately, this doesn't work while in video mode.There's not fully-automatic auto-focus in video mode, but usually the cameras that do are too noisy.  You can change the settings so that half-way pressing the shutter button makes it refocus, but it does the slower method and changes the exposure while it focuses.The battery lasts plenty long when doing photos, but video...not so much.  If you plan on doing a video shoot of any length, you'll need to purchase additional batteries.  I'd recommend getting a battery/power grip.  They have a cheap one on here that comes with 4 batteries and has a timer for doing delayed photos and time lapses that I'd recommend.Also, for fun, install the Canon EOS Utility on a laptop.  You can use your laptop to take pictures, do time-lapses, change settings on the camera, and more.Technicolor has a picture profile you can download called CineStyle, which is good for color grading your video in post.  Otherwise, I recommend the Faithful picture style that the camera comes with.Check out LegendaryMedia and 8bitDigitalTV for pictures and videos using the T3i.""

A major factor in reducing noise, the CMOS sensor assures that images shot at highest sensitivity will be remarkably smooth.Features worth notingWhen you look at this class of DSLR, sophisticated entry level, there are a handful of impressive features that add value to this investment. In addition to a reliable picture taking machine, T3i owners can experiment with off-camera flash, record HD movies with great audio, and creatively play with their images while they're still in camera. Here are a few of those highlights.Built-In Wireless Flash Control (new feature for Rebels) If you have an external Canon flash unit with wireless slave capability, such as the Speedlite 430EX II, you can fire it off-camera with the T3i. You don't need a separate wireless controller. Options include firing a single off-camera flash, balancing the off-camera flash with the built-in flash unit on the T3i, or operating multiple external flashes. The upshot is that with just one external flash and the T3i, you have a number of flexible lighting options. This is a powerful feature for a consumer camera, putting pro lighting techniques at your fingertips for an affordable price.Vari Angle LCD (new feature for Rebels) The T3i's adjustable LCD is an excellent design for recording video. You flip open the LCD, then swing it out. You can angle up or down, or turn it completely around and fold it against the back of the camera. The resolution is terrific both for Live View capture and playback. When you're done, turn the screen around and secure it face-first against the back of the camera to protect it during transport. This encourages capture from a variety of angles helping you make more interesting movies while not straining your back and neck in the process.Full HD Movie Recording with Controls On the T3i you can record 1920x1080 video at 24, 25, or 30 fps; plus 1280 x 720 video at 50 or 60 fps; or standard definition 640 x 480 video at 25 or 30 fps. Emerging filmmakers can opt for auto or manual exposure mode while shooting video, and even choose between auto and manual options for recording audio. The audio is further enhanced thanks to the built-in mini-stereo mic jack for an external microphone. There's even a built-in wind filter.Video Snapshot Function This feature allows you to record a series of 2, 4, or 8 second video clips, then, without editing, the T3i combines them into one movie that can be saved to your Mac or played via the HDMI port that allows direct connectivity to an HDTV. Each Snapshot is saved to an album after you record it, and you have the opportunity to keep or discard the clip. Once you've captured the various sequences, go to playback mode and watch the fast-paced move you've just created. It's a cool feature that saves you a trip to the desktop movie editor. Once you're finished, disable the Video Snapshot mode to return to regular movie making.Creative Filters After you've captured an image, you can continue to play with it via the Creative Filters mode in the playback menu. There are five to choose from: Grainy B/W, Soft Focus, Fish-Eye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, and Miniature Effect. Once you choose an effect, you can apply one of three different strengths. When you're finished, the T3i processes the image and saves it as a separate file on the memory card. The new Fish-Eye effect is a new addition to the Creative Filter line up, and one of the most interesting effects. Be careful, though, it can be addictive.Setting Maximum Speed for Auto ISO Existing-light photographers will appreciate the ability to set the maximum speed for Auto ISO. Auto ISO, without a top limit setting, can sometimes result in noisy photographs. The T3i allows you to set the maximum ISO speed to a level you're comfortable with so you can use this feature with confidence.The available range is from 400 to 6400. If you're conservative about how high you want the ISO to go, then you can choose a setting such as 800 for the top end limit. But because this camera performs so well at higher ISOs, you can easily set the limit to ISO 1600 or 3200 and still get very good image quality. The choice is yours.Star Ratings In Camera While viewing images in playback mode on the T3i, you can assign a star rating to it. These ratings are transferable to Aperture, Bridge, and Lightroom, but not iPhoto. So when you upload your images to your Mac, the star ratings are displayed to help you immediately identify your favorite shots.Copyright Information Setting When you access the Copyright Information tab in the Menu, you can set the author's name and copyright details for every shot that is recorded with the camera.Image qualityWith either kit lens, the 18-55mm or the 18-135mm, the Canon T3i provides excellent image quality in terms of sharpness and detail. If you're tempted to upgrade to the 18-135mm kit lens for its extended zoom range (29-216mm in 35mm terms), then it's probably worth the bump in price. But in terms of image quality, the 18-55mm holds its own nicely against the upgraded zoom. So don't expect better pictures with the more expensive kit option. Base your decision on zooming range, not picture quality.Even though either kit zoom isn't a particularly fast lens (maximum aperture ranges from f/3.5 to f/5.6 on both), the T3i is a reasonable low light performer because you can push the ISO to 1600, even 3200, and still get quality images.In our lab tests, the T3i performed incredibly well in its test group, earning a word score of Superior in the Exposure, Color, Sharpness, and Distortion categories. Click on any of our lab's test images to view the original files.DrawbacksThe limited amount of physical real estate on the T3i seems to have influenced the location of control buttons. The Menu and Info buttons are awkwardly placed in the upper left corner of the back of the camera. They're not nearly as easy to access there as, for example, the 60D's placement of them on the right side.The T3i would also benefit from the addition of a dedicated movie record button. Currently, you have to rotate the Mode dial to movie mode, then you can initiate recording with the Live View button on the back of the camera. It would be nice to directly access movie recording for those spontaneous moments.And finally, as with most Canon cameras, Auto White Balance produces excessively orange cast when shooting without a flash under tungsten lightingI would recommend that to anyone looking to buy a DSLR and it's probably the best DSLR I know today""

However, if you are going to be taking video with it, be aware that one huge defect is that it does not have autofocus.  In other words, while you are taking video, you need to manually focus with the lens and this is bothersome.  Most point and shoot cameras have autofocus, so since this was my first SLR, I was disappointed to see the lack of this useful feature.I can not say anything negative of the still pictures this camera takes.

They have a lot in common with the S90 point-and-shoot I upgraded from.The camera takes great photos of U5 soccer (one of the main reasons I decided to get it now).

"20111115","2.0","A wildly overhyped camera","I spent hours and hours, days upon days, weeks upon weeks trying to get good jpegs and videos from my T3i to no avail.  Sharpness was only fairly good (even when manually focused) with two different lens - not razor sharp like most of my previous Olympus cameras.  Colors were not fully lifelike so the images looked 'digital' instead of filmlike. Here again I was spoiled by my previous good experiences with Olympus cameras.  I did generally like the T3i's video, but here again colors were often inconsistent and the .mov files were huge and a pain to work with.After three months of fustration I bought an inexpensive Olympus Pen camera and was delighted with it's still image color and sharpness.And I also bought an inexpensive Panasonic SD90 camcorder for video because it's delivers superior image sharpness, image stabilization and zoom capabilities compared to my T3i in the more efficient ACHVD format.  I will sell the T3i because I want top quality still image and video and the Canon T2i, T3i, 60D and 7D deliver only mediocre quality in my opinion.""

"20111114","2.0","It will not replace your camcorder","I'm sure you bought this DSLR for the video capture feature, and that's fine.  However, at best this camera is a B-Camera.  It will not replace your camcorder due to the fact that it does not auto focus while recording.  In the manual, it does show you that you can AF while recording, but you constantly have to press the shutter button halfway.  One of the bad side effects is that refocusing is slow.  The AF speed isn't as lightning fast as if you're in Photo mode.  By the way, the AF is snappy quick when you're doing still shots.  So while you video record and press the shutter button to refocus, the camera CAN take 1-2 seconds until focus confirmation is achieved (HD video focus set to 'AF-Quick' for those wondering about my settings).  This has been my experience with my Canon 17-40mm f4 L lens.  Another bad side effect (and the manual mentions it) is that if you are video recording and you press the shutter button to refocus, your video's Exposure changes.  Let's say it took 1.5 second to refocus, your recorded video will have sudden dark and bright scenes in that 1.5 second.  IT IS NOTICEABLE and VERY DISTRACTING.  I need to do more test to see if I can eliminate that.  The manual does not recommend this style of refocusing and to just do a manual refocus by hand using the lens's focus ring.Another thing I hate about this camera when video recording is that it will NOT let you select a slower shutter speed below 1/30 sec.  I own a Panasonic AG-HMC40 3CCD camcorder, and I can adjust the shutter/Aperture independently.  I can shoot at 1/12 sec at 24p.  But with this camera, I can't go lower than 1/30 sec if I shoot at either 30P or 24P.  At 60P, you can't go lower that 1/60 sec.  This was something I was not aware of prior to purchasing this camera.  Others will say, why would you want to shoot at a low shutter speed?  Well you can do strobe effects, or more importantly, the lower the shutter speed, the more light you can get.  Sometimes I use 1/12 sec for static night shots.EDIT -- I just realized that I can get better video footage under dark lighting when the 'Movie Exposure' is set to AUTO.  I've had it set to Manual.  This is counter-intuitive to what I've been used to for my camcorder.Another thing I hate about this camera is the 12 minute time limit of HD recording!!!  From my test, the camera will STOP recording after 12mins.  I am recording with a 16GB SDHC card.  The user manual mentions it and is not a defect (but a handicap, IMO).  So if you set this camera on a tripod and start recording, you have to hit the record button every 12 minutes to continue.  This means that your video will not be smooth.  You'll have segments of video clips that don't seam together smoothly.It's 12min per 4GB on 24P, 30P and 60P.  By the way, I haven't had any overheating issues while recording.  But the camera does become WARM.  I was doing these test on a 68 degrees ambient room temp.  I'm not sure about summer time recording.  The user manual does mention about overheating.I'm really trying to love this camera, but I think I've been spoiled by my camcorder.But if you've read this far in this review, here's what I like about it:CONVENIENCE!  It's great to have a DSLR that can shoot excellent still shots and do HD video.SIZE! I've been to places where I absolutely can't bring both a DSLR (with 3 L-series lenses) and a camcorder at the same time... too much baggage and weight.  This consolidates everything in a nice small package.  It's small enough to not attract too much attention.  It's not as big as my camcorder, hence I can finally use a small camera bag.VARIO-SCREEN.  This is a camcorder trait that's finally on a DSLR.  I LOVE IT!  I can finally take some low or high position shots with ease.IMAGE QUALITY:  I own a Canon Rebel XT and the Canon 5D classic (not MK2).  This camera produces some really nice image, especially if you use some high quality lens.PRICE: I was thinking of getting the 60D, but price became a leading factor.  I paid $659 new, body only.Final thoughts:  I will most likely keep the camera because I already own some nice Canon lenses, but for those still debating about getting the Canon T3i or even the Nikon equivalent, I would recommend you look at the Sony A65.Why didn't I get the Sony A65?  I'm in too deep with Canon.  I've already bought some great lenses for the Canon Mount.  If you read this review and genuinely considered this camera, I suggest you get the SONY A65.  It has all the dislikes that I have about this camera fixed on their camera and more.  But if you already have some canon lenses, hold off until next year.  Canon MAY come out with a new DSLR body that can fix all of these issues.Recommendation:  If you decide to get this camera, then get a battery pack grip attachment with extra batteries!!!  YOU WILL NEED IT.  The battery that came with the camera (Genuine Canon) died before I can even fill up my 16GB card.  I did straight HD shooting with no rest and the battery indicator turned RED.  The screen is constantly on when you video shoot.  The optical view finder can't be used while HD recording because of the mirror flipped and locked.  This is an absolute essential if you decide to get some accessories.Good luck and shoot!""
"20111112","3.0","Not as easy to use as the 60D","Hopefully this will help someone who is undecided between the Canon T3i and the 60D. I last used a 35mm SLR about 15 years ago. I was used to being able to quickly and easily adjust aperture, iso and shutter speed. Since then I've used a progression of Canon digital point and shoots. When I got the T3i I was expecting a similar experience to my SLR days, but was sorely disappointed. To make changes with the T3i, you have to navigate through a difficult to use menu one the LCD display. With the 60D you're able make those changes much more easily without using the LCD menu. The small screen on top of the camera is a big help and displays the current settings. Otherwise the two cameras are capable of taking the same quality photographs.If you can, I would suggest trying both cameras out and seeing which you're more comfortable using.Pros for the 60D: Change settings more quickly, longer battery lifeCons for the 60D: Heavier and more expensivePros for the T3i: Lighter and less expensive.Cons for the T3i: More difficult to navigate menu and change settings, also shorter battery life""
"20111111","5.0","LOVE THIS CAMERA!","I upgraded from the T2i, and i am so happy that i did! The swivel lcd screen is so cool. Im already experimenting with different angle shots, i just could not get with a non swivel lcd. I didnt know how much i would love just that one feature, but i really do. The audio controls is also really awes! The zoom feature while in movie mode is nice too. Because im only shooting with a 50mm prime right now, being able to zoom in makes it really nice. Sure its only a digital zoom, but with good lenses, not zoomed to full capacity, it should work well. Even at 3x, that turns my lens into a 150mm, sort of. haha. Overall i love this cam, and if someone is thinking about upgrading from the t2i, do it! you wont regret it. FYI. Become an Amazon Prime member, or do the free trial. I got this shipped over night for only $4 bucks! haha. I hate waiting a week for stuff like this to arrive.""

"20111109","5.0","Canon T3i","After searching and searching for a DSLR camera I had almost convinced myself of the T2i. I resisted and ended up waiting to purchase the T3i, which was the best decision I made. At a glance the camera has a good feel to it and overall has the same features as the T2i. The main differences I noticed in it were the flip out LCD screen, which I use more often for some of the photos I take. Among the screen, the improvement to the video truly being 1080p and the simple menu. The camera itself is very user friendly whether you have read the manual or not. I am a person to read through and learn the various features the camera has to offer. I am impressed with the lens that comes with the camera for the wide angle aspect of it due to a lot of places I shoot pictures there are a lot of people and requires me to get close to get the shot I want. Disappointed they offer HDMI input, but don't provided the cable. I have only scratched the surface of my purchase, but I am pleased thus far. I recommend anyone looking for a camera to at least give the T3I a glance or consider it.""
"20111109","5.0","Once again, good job Canon!","I ordered this camera as an additional one to save me constantly switching out lenses.  Most of my photography consists of dogs and nature out kayaking, playing on a beach, or out camping.  I have the Canon T2i, and am thrilled with it all around.  I have two favorite L lenses... the 24 - 70 mm and the 70 - 300.  I also have several primes that I use as well.Since I cannot stand running out of battery, I also use a battery grip.  I recently bought a double harness so I could more easily manage out in the field while using my Rebel with the long lens and my G10 for close or wide angel shots, since I managed to crack the LCD screen on the G10 by carrying them both around my neck.  When it came I realized how off balance it was with one heavy camera and one light so I bought the T3i as an early Christmas gift for myself.I wanted another T2i, because I don't do video OR creative filtering in camera so the changes from the 2 to the 3 didn't appeal to me at all.  I LOVE my T2i, but somehow couldn't justify spending nearly the same amount as the new model cost.The camera came today and I did a few test shots between the two using exactly the same subject, flash, and lens.  I actually have to admit, the ones with the T3i came out obviously ahead of the T2i, even before any editing was preformed.  I was really surprised since I expected them to be exactly the same.I am nervous about the articulated LCD screen breaking off and I wasn't thrilled that the screen doesn't shut off like the T2i did, but I guess both worries are easily solved by keeping it turned around.I do wish Canon would make a STILL camera without the addition of video, but I do understand the appeal of video to some people.  I only used it once with the previous Rebel and I must admit, it was quite good!!!In closing, unless I discover something bad in the next few weeks, I expect this camera will also become a favorite, and congratulate Canon on continuing their great Rebel tradition!!!""
"20111108","5.0","Best crop sensor camera for the price","I bought this camera when it was $850 and I think it's a steal now with this new price. So the camera has 80% of the things that its bigger brothers have: a gorgeous LCD screen, same processor as other crop sensor cameras, 1080p video recording, wirelessly controlling flashes. It's also lightweight and compact. The kit lens is great, too. Of course you can't compare it to an L-lens, but I think for just $110, it has an unbeatable value/price. I'm now thinking to upgrade to 5d Mark III once it's available and this was my first DSLR, but I can honestly say that it served me very well while I was an amateur. For those of you who are interested in the camera, I strongly recommend buying the 430 Ex II flash as well.Pros:Price1080p videoCompact and lightweightGreat lens for priceCons:Focus points are not as good as the expensive models(which is justified by the price)ISO is usable only until 800""

I am your typical mom that loves to keep a camera pointed in my kids direction at all times.  I owned a Canon PowerShot camera for years and was satisified with the pictures that I took, but knew that they could be better, sharper...Well several accidental drops of said camera later, and I am the proud new owner of my very first DSLR.  Let me just say, I am in LOVE with this camera.  I know that there are bigger, better (more expensive!) choices out there, but for me, the T2i was the perfect fit.  I researched cameras for well over a month, reading review after review, blog after blog, and ultimately they all pointed in the same direction.  Anything more powerful (or with more buttons to figure out) was going to be a waste of money on my part.  The T2i will do more than I probably will EVER need and the price point was just right.  When my p&s camera first bit it, I had seen the all new Canon EOS 60D & immediatley decided that I HAD TO HAVE IT.  I am so glad that I fought off the urge to purchase it before doing some research.  The T2i is a great beginner-intermediate camera for someone who have never owned a DSLR.  I could'nt be more thrilled with my purchase...my kids however, they really enjoyed that month of research time when MOM was cameraless!""

I also wanted a lens with enough range that I don't have to switch lenses as often.The T3i is nice, a little more complicated than the XT. I would prefer that it does NOT take video but that isn't an option.My only complaints about the T3i is that the power switch is in the same place as before, and so I still may accidentally move the mode dial when turning it on/off, which can result in improperly exposed pictures. Also, I still haven't figured out the best settings for the autofocus, it still seems sort of hit-or-miss.The T3i body worked fine with my other Canon lenses.However, this kit had an 18-135mm lens that seemed to work fine. But then when I looked at the images on my computer, the focus is soft. When I zoomed in to Actual Pixels view in Photoshop, the images are not crisp.

"20111004","5.0","Best Camera for the $$","First off, I have been in the video production business for 30+ years and have used all sorts of DSL cameras for video and since video gives you 30 frames per second, I feel my knowledge of photography can match that of most pro still photographers therefore I feel confident when I say, this is the best camera for your dollar.  I recently went on a cruise to Alaska and found myself hiking up a mountain, sweating a lot with the camera around my neck I learned once I made it back to the bottom of the mountain, that the camera was acting up.. I guess some of that sweat ended up in the camera and basically it became a brick.  Once back on the ship, I tore it apart and over night it dried itself.. in the morning it was working completely fine and I have never again witnessed a problem.. learned my lesson however and have since placed a rain hood on it.The tech on this thing is great, with the ability to not only shoot in RAW mode but RAW+ mode, giving you both types of files for each shot.. this is a great time-saving feature, not having to convert from RAW for those shots that do not require the major file size.Leaving it in auto mode, even a child can use it since it is completely auto. My friend who has never used an SLR before bought the T2i at Costco before the cruise so I was teaching her the basics and she caught on pretty quick.  She had troubles with one of her lens when she gave the camera to me to take her picture, I thought it was a hair on the gate but it turned out to be part of the autofocus gear as the autofocus would not function without a small nudge. Upon returning to Seattle she returned it to Costco for a full exchange as they didn't have any in stock, she ended up buying a new one when in Texas and even saved a little on the tax. That being said, and the fact that hers was the T2i and this review is about the T3i.. the only real difference was the retractable viewfinder which is a must for me, that and the video mode offers a few more enhancements but I don't believe anyone should be buying a DSLR for the sole purposes of shooting video but that being said, you most certainly can use it, especially with all the available remote adapters (ie: focus puller, cables)The battery life is very good. I purchased two additional batteries knowing full well what it is like in the field when you are running low on juice.""

"20111001","5.0","Ed's Canon SLR","I've always considered myself a 'Good Amature' photographer. I bought a used Canon EX back in the 70' when my first son was born. Over the years I must have taken a million pictures with that guy. As time went by and digital technology got better I bought a Sony Cyber-shot 3.3 maga pixels. It has a fairly large Carl Zeiss Lens and took beautiful pictures but was slow. When my youngest son started playing basketball I needed something faster I went back to my Canon 35mm camera and got good shots but the digital age has spoiled me and I hated having to wait for prints to be developed. I went ahead and bought a Sony Digial Handycam and took movies of his whole high school basketball and football career. Fast foward to 2011. I decided that I needed an SLR camera again. I was missing too much with the point and shoot camera that I had. It was good for shooting outdoors but in low light situations it did poorly. I started shopping around for SLRs. After reading a lot of reviews and it came down to a Canon or a Nikon. I went with the Canon because I had history with Canon and felt comfortable with it. I bought it from Amazon, they had a summer deal going on and I got the long lens added to the package for $30 bucks. Out of the box this guy is fantastic, it takes beautiful low and very low light pictures. Everything I have shot with this camera has come out sharp and crisp. I bought a DVD telling how to get more out of this camera and am amazed with it's capabilieies. I'm trying to learn how to do everything that is possible with this camera but that'll take a while. I'm also finding that many of the quality accessories for SLRs are very resonably priced. Bottom Line; Everytime I pick this guy up, I feel like I'm shaking hands with an old friend.""

"20110923","5.0","I would definitely recommend this for a friend!! But choose your purpose...","Great camera for a beginner. Works great in still and video modes. The only thing that the description doesn't give any information about is the type of memory card to be used. In the manual, they say Class 6 (6 MBps) or higher. And I have purchased a 32GB Class 6 SDHC card, and it can only record 640x480 30fps video. But lets be honest, you buy an amazing camera with pretty cool features and why do you want to compromise on some feature that degrades the whole purpose of the camera.But anyways, I did some research about HD video recording on DSLRs and found that even though Class 6 SDHC cards work great with the photos, they don't work for HD videos. And the best memory cards suitable for the HD video recording are supposed to be Class 10 (10 MBps) or higher. And following that I also found that in some cases Class 10 (10 MBps) might also not work. And I did further research for find the apt memory card for HD video would require minimum of 30 MBps data rate (45 MBps would be better). But I had to compromise and buy the 30MBps version which is quite costly (about $95).So, if you are buying this camera for a photography purpose its a wonderful and great camera. But provided the memory card is suitable for HD video recording, the video camera also works great!!.I need not give any more info regarding the image quality and other stuff, they are always there for any camera...I would definitely recommend this for a friend!!""

I have shot a few quick movies with it and the playback is great as well as the quality of the HD recording.If you are looking for a huge step above a point and shoot digital camera then this is your camera. Its more bulky when compared to a point and shoot but for the quality of pictures it takes its well worth the added weight.""
"20110912","5.0","Sample footage says it all","Where do i start off? As an amateur, I guess I'll let the video quality speak for itself here. Let me tell you this camera has taken over my summer. Every chance I get I use it, I do. It features a wide array capabilities fit for experienced and beginning photographers. Its abilities are limitless. You can check out some my youtube channel for more 'oceansidecreations' and make sure to hit like.Pros: Interchangeable lens, sensor and swivel screenCons: buttons, gripe, and low light.Bottom line:Love it, you'll get use to the buttons and small body. I got a tripod which made my life a lot easier. Another feature I love is the ability to edit video from your camera (trimming beginnings and endings). Editing is arguably the hardest part of filming. So the ability to trim down footage on the fly is beneficial. Also, The tilty swivel screen comes through all the time. As far as the 10x digital zoom goes, I can honestly say I hardly ever use it. If you have any other questions, please ask.I was conflicted between getting this and the 60D. I love the body design on the 60D, but wasn't feeling the extra debt for the same sensor. If you are an amateur, just grab the T3i. If you are an experienced photographer and use your camera more readily. Than I'd go with the 60D. Just keep in mind its due for an upgrade. Either way I love my camera and I back it 100 percent.""
"20110912","5.0","Graduated from Point-N-Shoot","I just bought this Canon T3i as my first ever SLR or DSLR.  I did a fair amount of research and I kept on coming back to this camera.  I've had several Canon camera's in the past and have always liked the quality of pictures they produced so I guess you can say that for me, all roads really do lead to Canon.  I've only had it a little more than a week and am learning new things about this camera every day.  I got the 18-55mm kit lens and just bought the Canon 55-250mm IS lens too.  Sorry I can't give a detailed review about the camera like many have done so far but as a beginner I can say that I LOVE this camera and am very pleased with how easy it is to use and understand the controls.  I'm glad I took the plunge and bought it.  Highly recommend.""
"20110912","4.0","a good upgrade from the XTi and a better bargain than the 60d","This was an upgrade for my wife from her Rebel XTi, which she's used for over 30,000 photos in about 3 years.  it's slightly bigger than the XTi and the size of the rear screen means buttons have been moved around so it took a little getting used to, but the image quality is very good.the new LCD on the back is great and the resolution helps you determine whether your shot is focused.  the focusing is great when shooting stills, but it's painfully slow when doing video so you'd be better off with a canon lens that does Full Time Manual focus.one downside is the disappearance of the sensor that used to sit below the viewfinder and turned the screen off when the camera was put to your eye.  now you have to turn it off with a half-press of the shutter.  i do not like this change.""

One thing I am complaining about which is a major part of this camera (t3i)is the continuous shooting mode (3.7fps). The camera shoot great for about 5 or 10 minutes of continuous shooting then it slow to less than 1fps. There nothing I can do or change to speed it up. Only after shutting it down for about 20 minutes to cool down will the camera return to normal. Somehow, everyone gives great reviews and no one mentioned about this problem. I am wondering if I got a defective camera.""
"20110907","5.0","First DSLR","Neither my family nor I are particularly adept at manual (some would say 'proper') photography.  I had received a Rebel film SLR years ago with the hope of taking it up as a hobby.  I can say, I've picked up photography as a hobby, but rather with a series of Canon digital point-n-shoots over the years.  The latest is an aging Ixus, the model number escapes me.  Yes, I'm rather fond of the Canon brand.  They have served me well shoved in countless pockets and packs throughout travels and tribulations.I ordered this camera two days before my wedding, figuring that the shots would necessarily be better than my point-n-shoot.  Amazon's Sunday delivery was exemplary and of good value.  I remembered the pre-sets on my original Rebel that could give instant access to better pictures without needing to understand apertures, etc. - I realize that's probably nails on a chalk board to some.  What I didn't intend on, was being absolutely floored by the stunning quality of shots that myself and all other family members (of much less experience snapping pics than I) were able to get on the day of our wedding.For those who are looking for an 'in' into the world of DSLR photography, this camera is easy to understand right out of the box.  And I promise to try to get f-stops, etc. to stick in my head this time for sure.  I can't wait to take this travelling!""

While I don't aspire to become a professional photographer, this camera is going to turn me into a decent photographer. I really doubt that I needed a more expensive camera. At this price point this camera is going to keep me happy for a long time.My only complaint is the user manual. It was translated into English...there are some curious and confusing sentences from time to time. The index is not complete. The overall layout of the manual could be better. But it's passable.""

I've not been disappointed in any way. Canon have significantly improved the information on each of the settings which will help anyone still learning. Also, the new Q function allowing you to change photo settings from one screen is brilliant. The pictures are incredible although I've only scratched the surface of it's capability thus far. It has a solid and robust feel without being overly heavy, and the battery life is the usual Canon excellent length.

Obviously not as robust as the 5D Mk II but overall a very good camera for the price.  There are controls quibbles that I have with all Canon cameras as their controls layouts simply do not compare favorably to my Nikons.  However, all cameras involve trade-offs of one kind or another--these are things that you just cope with and move on.Overall, a very good camera for the price.""
"20110830","5.0","Canon EOS Rebel T3i","The T3i is an excellent dSLR. I am a serious amateur photographer with a focus (pun intended) on fine art photography. The T3i, with it's articulated LCD is very flexible in allowing me to hold the camera at extreme angles to take shots that were either impossible or very difficult with my previous Canon dSLR. The image quality is impressive. I have had this camera for about since mid-June. I have shot probably about 3,000 photos with it thus far. I have tried the T3i's video capability only briefly, so do not take my rating of the its video capability with much credence, but I like what I saw.

"20110828","1.0","Bad quality images, movies","I really hate to say this, being a Canon guy who has tons of Canon camcorders and cameras, but this T3i is pure JUNK.I got the 18-55mm kit lens and tried it out.not a single image is sharp! I am a pro photog and video guy with 40 years of experience, so I know how to take a picture or shoot video.Set the camera on AUTO mode, what can be wrong here... well the same blurry image. Nothing in focus, yet it showed it was in focus. Yes, the LIVE VIEW or the optical view does show a CLEAR image, but when loaded onto a computer, it's all blurry when you look at it a bit closer. I compaired with several Nikon DSLR just to make sure maybe my eyes are not good as use to be... the Nikon images from a low cost D-40 is far superior with a kit lens than this 18mp image is full of noise in full sunlight, on AUTO mode or ANY OTHER settings.This was out of the box BAD.Sent it Canon and they sent it back as 'fixed'. NOTHING has changes and they say it's normal and all is OK.Am asking you, If I shoot a 1.2Mp setting on a D40 Nikon and a 18mp setting on T3i and the Nikon is superior quality and sharpness then this T3i what do you think it's wrong? To Canon repair it is fine.Then I set it to 1.2Mp or slightly higher on the T3i and the images is sooooo blurred even a toy camera can do better.Next I used an old Canon SD-800 camera set at 1mp (close to it) and it's image is superiour to this Canon 18Mp !So, it's not me and  not knowing how to use a camera. I have six DSLR and many other cams.Canon refuse to replace this LEMON and just giving me the run around.In addition the Movie mode shuts off with a Class-10 SD card after a ten seconds. NOT selected the 10 seconds shots... but it does it on its own. After five tries, finally gets to record in video mode. The image quality is so bad, with the kit lens and other lenses from 24mmm to 50mm. Makes no difference, but the prime lens is a 'sharper' BLURRY image... if you can believe it.So, I have a $1K down the toilet and Canon don't stand behind their products.I urge everyone buying any Canon model DSLR to check it out within a few days and if no good, take it back to the STORE!I missed that opportunity and now stuck with this 'repair' revolving door and getting nowhere.This maybe a refurbish by Canon or someone taken this back to the store, repackaged and sold as new.... at Walmart.I don't blame Walmart, and I don't think they have anything to do with refurbish or re-sold cameras without indicating as such. The inventory showed as NEW camera.""

"20110819","5.0","I Seriously love this camera!","I am an entry-level DSLR owner, and wanted a camera that would grow with me. The T3i is absolutely perfect for this.I don't actually care about the video-taking capabilities of this camera, though when I have taken video with it, it's been fine. What I really care about is how well it takes pictures, and for that, it's fantastic. The full-on automatic setting is great, sometimes taking a much better picture than I would have. The 'no-flash automatic' is what I tend to use most, especially in indoor areas like museums. When I want to play with DOF, the Aperture Priority setting is excellent.This camera performs admirably in low-light settings, often getting shots without a flash that shock me with their quality. In Lightroom, I don't have to do much postprocessing to get my shots to come out looking great. My only complaint is that the automatic setting does tend to overexposure, so if you're in a situation where the lighting isn't standard, keep an eye on that and switch to a more manual setting. It's a lot harder to fix overexposure than underexposure.If I have any complaint about this camera, it's that I would have liked more, or better, indicators via the viewfinder. I find I use the viewfinder -- which is not, by the way, the brightest or sharpest viewfinder I have ever seen -- more than the LCD monitor by far -- to the point where I sometimes don't flip the LCD monitor over at all. And about the flipping -- that's a very nice touch. I don't often use it like one would use a side-view mirror, but I do love that flipping it over protects the screen.Likely, if you're an enthusiast who can afford this camera, you're not going to use the postprocessing techniques in the 'Creative mode' section of the camera; you'll use an outside tool like Lightroom. I wouldn't put much stock in being able to, for example, apply a magenta tone to your picture. And labelling on-phone is a giant pain. Unless you think you'll forget the location, don't even bother.The kit lens on this camera is actually quite good - I alternate between the kit lens and the f/1.8 50mm that everyone who owns a Canon DSLR should have. Unless you're wanting to take significant zoom images, it's a clear, fast lens for most work.For what I wanted this camera to do, I have found it to be absolutely fantastic.""

After a lot of research, I decided on the Canon T3i as the best comprimise of the features I wanted and what my budget could afford.  After about 3 to 4 weeks of using the camera, I love it.  The photo quality is great and I am learing how to use many of the advanced features.  Even before learing how to use many of the features, I was able to take excelent photos using the automatic modes.  I highly recommend this camera.

"20110815","5.0","This camera is so intuitive, I'm encouraged to learn photography beyond point and shoot.","I'm very new to DSLR and to shooting with anything but auto mode. At first I decided on the Nikon 5100 because I've always like my coolpix, my relatives own Nikon DSLRs (higher end),  and the wonderful reviews online. I ended up returning that one because the LCD goes black when turning it 180 deg. after only a  week of shooting and felt discouraged after reading about Nikon customer service rating online. My friend suggested Canon 'easier to learn if you are new to DSLR' she said.Somehow, after playing with the controls and reading the manual that came with this camera, it made me realized why and how people would use manual, Av, Tv, P mode. (I thought it would be too to complicated and cumbersome to do when I had the Nikon). This camera is very intuitive, you can change desired settings without taking your eyes off your subject. I think it will be easy to always remember how to change the main settings.Now I am excited about learning composition,exposure, etc  and improve my picture taking skills.Btw, had a chance to compare the portrait of my daughter I took with the d5100 (P mode) vs the t3i, this kit lens (18-55) seem to be very sharp, with accurate skin tone. I got worried at first because I think I prefer a softer look of skin tone, like her skin with the d5100 ( like it was airbrush, although it seems to have more red tones from d5100, not sure if I like that).  Luckily ,there is a setting I can adjust for a softer look in different degrees on this camera. THIS definitely is a keeper.""
"20110815","5.0","Excellent camera","For a so called entry level camera the t3i does an excellent job.  If your primary interest is taking pictures and not getting all involved with gee whiz technology the t3i is the ticket.  I shoot exclusively in raw and aperture priority at mostly low ISO's.  IQ is very good using the kit 18-135.  I suspect IQ would be even better with a higher quality lens.The only occasional fault is missing focus once in a while.  Be sure it has something specific to focus on; don't just point out in the landscape and hope for the best.  Those who shoot people and events should never miss focus.""

Improvement in low light situations would help in the next model, but it is something you can easily work around. All in all, great value for money.""
"20110811","4.0","Things to consider","Before buying the t3i, consider the t2i.  Research the reviews/differences.  They are small but quite significant to some people. If a t2i can be found for considerably less than the t3i ( $150 or more)  I would seriously consider it.The t3i is quite capable video wise, however it has no autofocus in video mode.  This is hit or miss for some people who don't like the autofocus constantly adjusting during recording yet it is difficult to zoom and focus at the same time.The t3i is absolutely a beginner higher level camera (I'm a beginner).  So its relatively easy to learn on yet takes awesome high quality HD photo and video.You'll need a high class SD card (I bought a 32 GB Transcend and am so far quite happy with it).Overall I am quite happy with the camera and certainly not trying to turn any one off about buying it, only inform others of things I came to learn AFTER buying mine.You should definitely research the t2i as well as the Nikon competitor of this camera before settling on this model.""
"20110807","4.0","Switched from Nikon to Canon","Since I have switched from Nikon to Canon, a lot of my review is based on comparison to Nikon.Pros:Canon service is apparently better than nikon. Will edit this if this does not turn out to be true. My switch was mostly due to pathetic nikon warranty service.The IS works really well and I think better than nikon's which I had tried for a week with a borrowed D5000.Digital 3x zoom in video mode.The 430EX II external flash can be supported by the camera wirelessly. On nikon's this is only true for the more expensive SB800s flashes.Cons:Auto focus in 'live view' mode (seeing through the lcd instead of the viewfinder) is extremely slow. Makes me not ever wanting to use it.Most canon lenses have loud autofocus motors. The lenses with the nicer USM AF motors are too expensive.No mode in canon to set Av mode and set min shutter speed while letting the camera pick the ISO. Standard in Nikons. Canon seems to pick the shutter speed based on the zoom (focal length selected).White balance in Full auto mode sometimes messes up. Some pictures came out blue-ish.No good priced 'normal' 50mm/35mm lens available. There is only one 50mm el-cheapo which apparently looks extremely cheap but I will buy it anyway.I upgraded from nikon D50 to this. So of course the pictures are much much better.In hindsight, The nikon D5100 has a better (larger DX sensor vs canon APS sized sensor) sensor. So less noise on the Nikon.Also, I think that video modes in SLR cameras are fairly useless unless you are good with manual focussing and use the tripod. BTW, the lens IS does work in video mode.I will edit this review as I play with this camera more. The 18-135 lens is nice but a bit large. Maybe its large thats why the image quality is very good.""

"20110806","5.0","Canon T3i ROCKS!","Video reviews to come! This body is rock solid and worthy of purchase for ANY and ALL people entering or needing an advanced DSLR camera. I purchased the body only - I have several lenses from my previous Canons which are NOT currently 'IS' lenses. I've been shooting people, places and other things for more than 45 years and LOVE this camera. It's extremely mobile. I can just flip open my tripod lock and GO! My only issue with the T3i concerns the GRID functions. These work only in LIVE VIEW MODE (as I've found so far). As soon as you move up to manual for full control, you lose the grid (I use the 3x3), which helps me set my composition. Yes, I can use my eye to place an imaginary grid in the viewfinder, but WHY when one is readily available.With my additions on the camera already, video/image reviews will be plentiful. As I learn new tricks and shortcuts, I'll inform the public so they too can enjoy ALL of the features of this outstanding camera. The articulating screen wasn't necessary, yet it IS what made me choose this model over the T2i. The prices were just too close to pass it up. I'll be adding more T3i and T2i cameras to my photo biz in the coming months, as well as trying out the 'IS' lenses. This camera is very tight on power consumption and has extreme accuracy when you set it for pinpoint focusing as I do for model and portrait photography work. The macro features are also on par with its more advanced (and WAY higher priced), big brothers to this camera. Now, the 18.1MP sensor.....WOW! The image sizes of the CMOS sensor allow me great latitude in adjusting and tweaking my RAW images anytime I wish to be creative. If you are just starting out, are bored with the out of date 'point-n-shoot,' want to upgrade your digital cams, or you want to move from film to digital, the T3i will not disappoint. It's an excellent camera for ANY level of photographer - beginner or experienced pro, this camera really shines. Oh, and the video.....It's 1080p HD, nothing more needs to be said. Canon, you've been ROCKIN' my images for 30+ years!!!! Stay cool and keep up the great work. Craig Benham - Photographic Adventures, Ltd - I'm outta here and back to taking pics!!!""

Debated between this and the Nikon D3100, but at this price it can't be beat.Basically the same as the T2i so it is not worth it if you plan on upgrading from T2i. But for someone first buying a Canon DSLR, it is almost like buying the more expensive Canon 60D.""
"20110801","4.0","Best DSLR in this range","It is super light, like really really light, but it produce fantastic and professional images if you play it right.I love it, worth the money!""
"20110731","5.0","Excellent","Starting a small photo business and needed a back-up camera to my Canon 7D. Have really been impressed with the performance of the T3i. The large flip out screen is useful to get some dramatic shots from different angles. The light weight (compared to the 7D) is actually a bonus when hand holding the camera while taking video. Photo quality is superb especially at low light levels. Took wonderful action photos at the Phillies game last night using a Canon 18-200 lens on the T3i and a 3200 iso setting.""

"20110730","5.0","Excellent Entry to mid level camera","I bought this camera bundled with a 55-250mm IS lens as an upgrade to my rebel xti. I noticed that the ISO as a major enhancement when compared to my rebel xti. Overall a great camera.""
"20110729","5.0","First DSLR, absolutely amazing.","I finally made the upgrade from standard P&S cameras.  My previous camera was a Panasonic DMC TZ5, a great little camera that even after 3 years is still pretty impressive for it's size.  A little background on me, I work in the film industry as a motion graphics / special effects artist, so my review might be a little skewed towards the video side.  I bought this camera with a 50mm f/1.8 prime lens.When I first picked this up, I was surprised at how lightweight it is.  The older TZ5 is pretty solid but feels almost as heavy as the T3i!  I shot some pictures during the day, played with the awesome depth of field and got some outstanding pictures.  Great contrast, color, white balance, exposure, everything was perfect.  It was actually difficult to get a bad photo even on the more manual settings.Where I was really shocked was low-light performance.  I got pictures I had never thought I could ever get without using the flash.  Even at 3200-6400 ISO I was amazed by the clarity, balance, detail and noise level.  Yes, you can see the noise, but in my humble opinion I actually like a little noise, to me it gives it a little cinematic flare, but that's just me.  But in my old TZ5 I had to severely decrease the shutter speed so much which made it almost impossible to get a clear shot, and even if I could get a clear shot it was either extremely underexposed, white balance was off, or the noise was just too much.  Again the T3i has excelled in every photo I have shot so far (200+).Even more amazing is when shooting 1080p video.  The exact same settings in photo mode will translate directly to video mode with the exact same results on screen.  It is really quite beautiful.  With the TZ5 shooting 720p video, I had to re-adjust the white balance, exposure and aperture for video, and it was still hit-or-miss which was sometimes painfully discovered late after reviewing the footage.  The T3i also has a standard mount and Microphone input and I was able to immediately mount my microphone for great audio.I'm probably a little biased because this is my first DSLR, so I can't really make a comparison with other DSLRs but I am certainly in love with this camera!  The most difficult thing about this camera is trying to decide which shot to choose from as every shot is perfect.""
"20110726","5.0","Great camera for the $","I have been an Olympus shooter up until now. I'm starting photography school in just a few weeks and had to have a camera with video (oly e30 did not).After reading review after review, I decided to go with this wonderful camera. I'm so glad I did! I never thought I could get the colors out of another camera like I could my Olympus, but the image quality is excellent. I'm a female and the camera fits my hands perfectly. Another rave is that the controls are so easy to find and adjust, BIG plus for me. It was basically down to three cameras for me, the 7d, nikon 7000 , and the T3i. After taking many test shots in the store and getting a feel for the camera, this one won me over.The only complaint I have is that I wish it had a faster burst rate. I know the 60d is faster but after reading all the issues with that camera, it was off my list. Other than that, I have no other complaints.Buy it and enjoy it!Happy Shooting!""
"20110725","5.0","Very Good DSLR with all purpose walk around lens..","I did a little bit of research before buying this camera... This is my first DSLR and still learning to utilize its all features.... I went for this combination (camera and lens) because I am just an amateur photographer and don't want to swivel around lenses when i want to take pictures.. With this range (18-135) well, you can capture most of the things you want to capture, far and near..  I am pretty much satisfied with it.. but in the near future, i might as well get a 75-300mm lens.. ( I see pictures of moon taken by my friends with high range telephoto zoom lens and get jealous ! ). There are a few issues like the  video does not have auto focus and in the low light, AF takes time...In short, I am happy with my investment.""
"20110724","5.0","Great Camera","I love this camera. This is my second camera from Canon and I am never let down with the quality of items. The image quality was outstanding. The battery life was long even when shooting in live mode or recording video. One thing i did notice was that the video file size was rather large even when not shooting in 1080p. That was the only real dissatisfaction I had with this camera. One of my favorite features is the flip out screen. You never realize how much you utilize it till you have the option. The ISO range is fantastic and makes it easy to shoot in low light without using flash. The menu is user friendly, as always, and the settings are all easy to use.

"20110721","4.0","Canon T3i - Good value for price point","I got this camera after reading reviews here on amazon and also doing my research on dpreview.Was torn between the Nikon 5100 and the Canon T3i.Certainly a learning curve, if you havent used a canon before. All the users controls are not intuitive. Certainly needed the user guide and a book to familiarize with the usability.Picture quality with the 18-55 mm lens are not bad. White balance is a little off.I would say overall I like it""
"20110720","4.0","Canon 3Ti nice camera","Just got the camera.  Started to explore all options and the 3' viewfinder that flips out is very cool.  For the price and long term investment, this is one of the cameras that should be in your top three.""
"20110717","5.0","Great still camera that also records decent HD video","Image Quality:Canon lens, Canon Camera, Canon Quality... what else is there to say?Video Quality:Face it... if all you want to do is create HD video with studio results, you'll be better off with a Canon XH-A1 (or equivalent) as a minimum. But as far as >$1,000 HD cameras go, this is about as good as I've seen for an SD-Card video camcorder. The real bonus is that the recordings have a film look to them compared to the common flat 'video look'.There are multiple video formats and if you film at the 60 FPS video setting, you can actually produce some cool slow motion effects with a video editing program.Ease of Use:Pros will probably scoff at the large amount of newb presets, but at least everything can be controlled manually. newcomers and hobbiests like myself will like the time-saving presets. Do yourself a favor and read the manual front to back while the battery charges.Low light pictures:Images look great in high, mid, low, and really low light conditions.My only gripe...The Video mode turns off the viewfinder (since light needs to continuously hit the sensor), and the LCD is hard to see in bright daylight, so focusing can be a chore. But this is only a minor gripe.All in all, this is a GREAT camera for the beginner and hobbiest. It's also a very good back up camera for the professional. This is an easy choice to help you transistion from 'snapshot' cameras to professional gear and I've found the video capabilities to be remarkable for a an SD-Card format camcorder.This is a great camera for vacation pics and home movies and all at a great price!UPDATED: (1 Nov, 2011) I need to contradict my earlier review on the video results. This is an incredible camera for capturing 1080P HD video! I have an XH-A1 and after months of shooting video for my company, the T3i consistently outperformed the A1 in video image quality. Better resolution and richer (more accurate) color. Granted the audio isn't on the same level as the A1, but with an external mic, it's records a very clear single channel.""

Make sure you buy from a reputable store whether on-line or brick & mortar.""
"20110713","4.0","Good Camera but watch using older EF lenses","Purchased this, got it in 2 days, had it ONE day only when started having problems.First off...I am a long time Canon user and pro photog.  I have other EOS and Canon cameras. Digital and film.Wanted to try this new model as it had the flip out back which I wanted.The first day it worked great. Took some great photos.Next day, I went a few miles from home and took what i thought would be a great series of shots.  Never used the swing back as it was a very bright sunny day.  Just used the view finder.  It took photos...BUT...when I got home I flipped out the swing back to look at some of them real quick and discovered that there was an error code showing... Error 01  Failure of lense to communicate with camera.  Ok, fine...went to look at the photos I took and discovered I had no photos.  apparently the error happened immediately on me turning the camera on at the spot i took the photos.  I was not happy because you do not get an error code through the viewfinder if there is a problem..least not one that I saw.  Triedf to resolve the error code..as explained by support, and though nothing worked at the time, I continued trying different things and finally the error code disappeared and camera working. Ok, fine...next day...went to take some more photos..checked the screen.and the error code was back.  This time nothing i did helped.Contacted Canon support and was told to return the camera or send it to one of their repair centers. I called because on the Canon website when i clicked on their support icon for this model with lense since they dont have a listing for body only, I would get a screen saying that they were not repairing this model. Kind of strange.So am returning it to Amazon for replacement rather than sending it to the Canon repair center as I didnt want to wait possibly weeks. Amazon is great about it especially since I had it only a few days.  They are shipping a new one immediately which is fantastic and gave me a return label for return shipping for the defective camera.Not sure just what is wrong with this first one as I have never had a problem with any of my Canon cameras other than normal wear and tear over time.  So I was very surprised. But I guess with all the ones I have bought over the years, there was always the chance to get one with problems. This time, I did.  I still like the camera and I will always use Canon's.  Just diappointed that I am now having to wait a couple of days to get the new one before I get out taking photos with it.  I would still recommend it, buy which and gave 4 stars..but cant give 5 because of being disppointed at getting a defective one.I will update this review after I get the new one and see how it does.///////////////// OK, I RECIEVED THE NEW CAMERA. //////////////////////////////////////And have been using, also purchased the battery grip for it and extra batteries.First, the new one is great.  No problems and I dont have the error with it and my EF lenses. Though the weather hasnt permitted much outdoor photography for me, I was able to attend the photoshoot that I had had scheduled and because of Amazons wonderful service, I was able to use my new camera.  And it performed as I had nticipated.  It is as good or better than any of my other canon cameras. I am going to upload some photos shortly taken with this new camera.  Its a good camera.  Fast, sharp and easy to use. The controls take a little getting used to as placement is some different from my older canons. But once I was familiar with them it didnt take long to change settings or to switch modes or whatever I wanted to do.//////////////////Another Update //////////////////////////////////Been using it even more.  And the error code 1 has begun appearing again.  And after alot of discussions with Canon support, it seems that this new camera is not going to be compatible with so-called 3rd party lenses.  Right folks, if you have Sigma or Tamron lenses or otherss for the EOS system, then there is a good chance they might not work on this new camera.  Just wondering if this is planned?  Now in order to use this camera, I have to buy new lenses.  I have Sigma lenses and only one canon lense.  My sigma lenses arent cheap ones either.  So now, only canon lenses will work.  Not what I liked to hear.  Makes we wonder why.  Of course, its obvious when you consider the cost of 3rd party lenses compared to buying a canon brand lense.  3rd party leanses are alot cheaper in cost and at little difference in quality.More I find out, the more I am disappointed in this camera. I still like it, but am NOT happy at having to buy lenses just to be able to use it now. Not the camera, but Canon. Sigma is being great and as a long time customer is allowing me to trade my old lenses for new ones.  Still going to be out more money, but now where near as much as I would have//////////////////////////////// NEW UPDATE //////////////////////////////////Have gotten my new Sigma lens. Used it extensively testing it the last few days. It works perfectly.  No problems and am really happy with the images.  Very bright and color saturation is good.  Photos look great. I print mine on a Kodak printer which I am very happy with. My small prints anyway.  I have larger ones done by a specialty shop.Regardless, the problems seem to stem from the camera and older 3rd party lenses being incompatible in some way.  New technology...??  Very possible.  And likely designed in by canon.  They will fix any canon lenses to work with the newer cameras.  So what the change was...who knows.  I do know that Sigma does stand behind their lenses.  They have a program for long time customers, so if you experience problems, like I did, get in touch with them.  You will not be disapponted. Just dont expect something for nothing.  I didnt...and I love my new lense.""
"20110712","4.0","Canon T3i vs Nikon D5100","I am a Nikon owner for years now trying to switch to Canon. After receiving this camera for a few days, I can now give a list of the differences between this T3i and the Nikon counterpart D5100.1. T3i has 4 buttons on the back defined to be used to control 'AF', 'White Balance', 'Drive Mode', and 'Picture Control', plus a dedicated ISO button on the shoulder, and a focus point selector on the top right corner of the back, which is great, and also the main reason I am trying to switch to Canon. For D5100, you have to go deep into the menu.2. T3i can trigger external flash, D5100 can't.3. T3i has White Balance Shifts with the Custom White Balance, Nikon D5100 Customer White Balance is a one shot setup.4. T3i's image quality seems to be a little better than D5100. Especially the LCD is brighter and looks great.5. T3i can work with any Canon lens, D5100 only works with AF-S lenses due to the lack of a body motor.6. D5100 has Distortion Control, before and after shoot, T3i doesn't.7. D5100 has Color Balance adjustment after shot, T3i doesn't.8. D5100 has Straighten feature, T3i doesn't.9. D5100 has Perspective adjustment, T3i doesn't.10. D5100 makes smarter decision when shoot in P, A, S modes, while T3i frequently makes you shoot in weird combinations like '1/320, ISO3200, f22'...Common issues:1. When shoot in bright sunlight, both tend to produce yellowish images, that's more like a common issue of CMOS sensor. I have never had a problem with CCD cameras, but I have experienced the same issue with all the CMOS cameras including Nikon D7000, Nikon D90, Nikon D300s.2. Live Mode focuses very slow on both (Nikon is slightly better).* The 18-135 lens is a pretty sharp IS lens, the IS works as great as Nikon's VR does. However, this 18-135 is only like 20-135, compared to the Nikon 18-200 VR.Overall, both cameras are good entry level cameras. T3i will be a better choice for a more advanced user.Update on July 13, 2011:11. D5100's battery lasts much longer, almost 50% longer. T3i's battery is smaller and the LCD is brighter.12. T3i's White Balance Bracketing is both ways. D5100 is only between Amber and Blue.13. D5100 has HDR feature which sometimes maybe useful.14. D5100's power switch is located in a perfect position. T3i's is a little awkward.""
"20110712","5.0","Less Is More","I've been a Canon customer since 1978, when I bought the 35mm Canon A-1, and I've had a Canon SLR ever since. Getting the new flagship model every three or four years was something I did for a long time, but when D-SLRs came along, I began downsizing after the EOS 1Ds I got in 2004. In 2007 I moved to EOS 40D and, although losing the full-size sensor was a sacrifice, it was a step in the right direction. With my recent purchase of the T3i, it's another move away from the professional models.Why would I do that? It's not so much the cost of new cameras that has shaped my decisions to downgrade; it's the size. While professional equipment is important to me, so are professional looking photos. And the truth is, after the newness wears off a D-SLR, I tend frequently to leave the big gun behind and rely on an advanced compact or ultrazoom for most of my shooting. As a result, I have more point-and-shoot pictures than I do pro quality ones.This tendency has ended with the purchase of the T3i. The camera is modestly sized, and I never leave home without it. With the 18-55mm kit lens (very nice little lens for its specs) or 24-105L, it's not any bigger than the Fuji Finepix HS10 I leaned on for most of my shooting this past year. And while the HS10 is hands down the best ultrazoom camera I ever used, the difference in image quality, performance and even video between it and the T3i is night and day.The T3i may not be blazing fast like my 1Ds or the 40D, but 90% of the shooting I do is not that kind of photography, anyway. What the T3i excels at is image quality. I have a whole raft of photos that, eked and tweaked to maximum effect in Photoshop, are only a little better than average because they were taken with a point-and-shoot camera. This camera's image quality, I'm happy to say, is superlative! So are the videos. Rebel T3i is almost too good to be true.An articulating LCD is something I've come to insist upon, and this one is by far the best I've ever used. I don't use Live View every time, but I've certainly been in that mode a lot more frequently with this model than with the 40D! In review mode, the refresh rate is a bit slow when zooming in to look at details, but it's not as slow as reviewing pictures on, say, Panasonic DMC-ZS7. (I did test Canon EOS 60D at Best Buy and noticed that the refresh rate is much faster on that model--perhaps because of the larger battery--but it's really not enough of an issue to deduct a star.)The resolution of the LCD is superb, and because it can be tilted and twisted to advantage, it can be viewed even in strong sunlight.Although the nine-point autofocus system is getting criticism for lagging behind Nikon, focus is swift and accurate. At 3.7 fps, burst mode is cut nearly in half from my 40D's 6.5 fps, but so far this has not hampered my ability to catch fast moving subjects.I appreciate the Lighting Optimizer function and use it a lot under the harsh lighting conditions in the desert where I live. It is of incalculable value.I have yet to haul out the owner's manual, thanks to the on-board guide. Of course it helps that I've owned Canon D-SLRs before, but adjusting settings on this camera is a lot different than on my previous ones. There have been some settings I would have normally needed to consult a manual for, but it hasn't been necessary because the answers are in-camera. (I never shoot in Auto, by the way. I'm a manual mode kinda gal.)Because images are very clean up to ISO 1600 and are usable even at ISO 6400, taking along the Speedlight flash so far has not been necessary. Yet another plus with this Canon iteration.There's something about blown highlights that really sets my teeth on edge, but that has not been a problem, thanks to the T3i's Highlight Tone Priority function. Dynamic range is very good to excellent, even a hair better than my 40D. Colors are more accurate, too. I prefer the contrast one stop under the camera's default setting, which is, admittedly, fairly punchy and will result in a blown highlight here and there. Reducing contrast just a tad fixes that.Eighteen megapixel resolution is outstanding.Sometimes I think about the EOS 60D's speedier performance, more advanced autofocus system and that wonderful electronic level and wonder if I made the right choice. But then I remember the heft and bulk of that camera and all the times I've left my SLR at home for those very reasons, and I know the T3i was the right decision. I really, really like this new camera--and I take it everywhere!""
"20110710","5.0","Great product for entry-level photographers and those who want to shoot pictures/video!","I typically write, while we have professional photographers who do a lot of our legwork at events.  But recently, at an engagement party, I was using my trustworthy Canon Powershot and when it came to photos, for every one photo I took, my friend with his T2i was take 10 or more.  And even indoors, his pictures looked great!Because I travel and cover so many events and there are times where our photographers are busy covering things, I figured...It would be great to have a DSLR.  I was at E3 and using my point-and-shoot, I knew right then and there, it was time to get a DSLR. I've been wanting to get one but frankly, the thought of me having to invest in the camera and several lenses and knowing they are not cheap...  I hesitated.But no longer.  It was time to get a DSLR!I have to admit....I was struggling between a Nikon 5100 or a Canon T3i (EOS 600) or even considering going a little higher-end.But I've read from professionals who say, 'It's the glass, not the body' and even our photographers, some of them are still using DSLR's made in the early 2000's and are quite content with the body, just focusing on the lens.For me, I wanted the best of both worlds of having something to shoot photos and video.  While I was close to getting the Nikon, the video review on digitalrev was enough to convince me to go for the T3i (EOS 600) and for its price range, I was comfortable with that.  Maybe in the future I can get something high-end but for now, I need something entry-level and with the T2i having dropped in price and selling out online and at stores, I noticed the T3i can be found and sure enough, while there are a few more technical things that it has compared to the T2i, for me, the swivel lens was something that I liked.  Especially for shots that require taking photos from weird levels and angles.  So, that was a plus for me!Upon opening the box, I realized that the T3i felt good but the higher-end cameras were more to my liking and are much more tougher.  But I figured, you get what you pay for and with the T3i, I just need to make sure I take care of it.WHAT YOU GET:I bought the version with an EF-S 18-55 IS II, so I got the lens with the two caps, inside are also the USB cord to transfer images and the Canon EOS Digital strap.  Instruction booklets, warranty registration and more.SO FAR, SO GOOD:Since owning the T3i, I have put this camera through hardcore use in a short amount of time.  Different events, different weather and have purchased quite a few things for this camera.If there is only one thing that I WISHED this camera did have was an easier menu to change things.  Aperature or Shutterspeed.  Granted, higher end models may have a display right at the top but looking at the LCD, definitely read the manual and experiment how to change various settings and experiment how you can change on the fly.And here are my thoughts that will definitely be different recommendations from others but it works for me:*  Get a good prime lens - 50mm 1.8 (preferably a 1.4) Canon lens.  I have the former which works great for portrait shots but I know already that the 1.4 works much better...it's also several hundred dollars more.*  Third party - I went third party for batteries, grip, hoods and they work perfectly.  I know there are diehards who purchase official Canon products but they are expensive and if you want to save money, look toward third party products.*  Read the Manual - I know there are people (like myself) who are impatient of reading manuals but in this case, read the manuals, especially those Canon-based brochures of lenses they recommend.*  Lenses - L lenses are great if you can afford them but if you can get yourself some Canon glass with image stabilization, this works great for entry-level photographers!  But if you are in it for the video, you want to get better glass!*  Research and Flickr! - I did a lot of research before buying this camera and for the most part, camera sites have all been positive. But definitely do your research.  I call my photographer friends and staff with questions but seriously, I learned that they are used to their high-end cameras and used to their lenses that they can give you some advice but it's best to experiment on your own but also go on Flickr and study other photographers, look at their exif data and get an idea of what lens they shot, what aperture, what shutter speed, etc.  And try to experiment with those settings.  Granted, lighting and setting is different but it's good to research and see what others are doing and what they were able to capture and knowing what lens they use.*  Last - Shoot Raw and consider purchasing a 10-speed, 16-32GB card.  Shooting at RAW gives you more options when using software like PhotoShop or Lightroom but you definitely want to shoot at RAW.  Nothing wrong with shooting via JPG, if you can manually fix those images on your own but I regret going to one event and shooting in JPG...I wished I shot RAW.  Now I do most of the time.  I say most of the time because I am in the process of purchasing a 32GB card (10-speed) and I have shot RAW 90% and 10% of the space, shot in JPG.JUDGMENT CALL:The T3i definitely delivers in picture quality and video.  Granted, if you have another $1,500+ to spend and money is no object...then go for the higher end Canon DSLR's.  But if you want to spend under a $1,000 but want very good quality for photos and video...the T3i is great!  There is not a humongous jump in features vs. its T2i brother and for some, the T2i may be enough, in fact, if you are not planning to shoot video, some people may want just the XSi which I still see people using and have taken great pictures with it.But for me, the extra features that I saw with this camera, I have seen the potential that I can utilize in different settings of event coverage that I go to.  If there is one thing that I wish I had...better lenses.  The kit lens is a good entry level but at 18-55, there are times when I needed to switch to the EF75-33 (f4-5.6 III) and I see that my photographer had the convenience of having an 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens and saw how it would make my life easier to have such a lens.In fact, I really like the IS (image stabilization lens) and now looking towards those lenses for my T3i.  The kit lens is good but you will definitely want a good zoom!  And also, I felt that using the cheap Canon 50mm 1.8 gave me more vibrant photos and better bokeh than the 18-55mm that came with the kit.As for video, the mic on the T3i is not the best, so you may want to consider purchasing a mic (one person I know uses a boom mic, another uses a mic that attaches on top T3i).  Taking video is very good but once again, if you are going for the T3i...plan to invest in larger GB cards...8GB is very good but I'm learning that I need more than that!  You may as well if you do cover events or take a lot of photos.While the menu interface could have been better, part of the convenience that Canon does give to those who spend more money...so, for under $1,000...the T3i is still a great deal for the quality it gives.I love this camera and I'm still learning as I go but so far so good! I still have yet to buy a Speedlite Flash (I do have an older Canon Speedlite from the late '70s (which I have used on a Canon A-1 SLR) that does work with the T3i but rather purchase something more modern.  And a few other things but for now, I'm just enjoying the pictures I take (and not enjoying the pictures I take, which is part of the learning process) but I'm quite content and happy that I bought this camera.If anything happens 6 months or a year down the line, I will definitely update this review.""
"20110709","3.0","Camera 4.5, video 2.5, Mac support 0","There are many excellent tech reviews there for this camera. I won't repeat.Hope these little details help you to make your mind:(1) Photo quality is good. I wish some controls would be easier to set/access (e.g., HDR, ..)(2) Video talking is an obvious after-thought. If you take lots of video, buy a point-and-shot or a real camcorder, which makes video-talking a lot of easier and more fun.(3) If you have Mac running 10.4, you should know that none of the new software coming with this camera works! You would have to buy a new computer too! (Probably not the first time being forced to upgrade?)..""
"20110708","5.0","Wow... Great SLR Camera!!!","Out of all gadgets I have, This one tops any I ever purchased. I'm going to try & be quick about reviewing this camera, but I'm very very excited about this one. I personally think canon did an excellent job in designing this. This is my first SLR camera. I'm use to sony products & don't knock there camera's, & I love their camcorders... but to find an all around camera & camcorder... is unusual. First of all this is a very economical good sized, & comfortable great feeling camera.. very powerful HD 1080p video & picture effects. Very easy to use, can use for a point & shoot right out of box. That's not really why I bought it, I bought this after doing a lot of research 6mths prior to buying. Even though I had in mind what I was going to purchase. I did'nt see or read reviews on this until the end of April 2011. So this had'nt been out much longer than that. This seemed right a way everything I was looking for in a slr camera + more. If you don't no how to use this, as soon as you turn it on there is information on lcd screen which ever dial mode you use right there... so for the beginner this is just great. I already have some knowledge of camera's. The dof on this camera is amazing along with other things you can do to manually control what you're looking to achieve in pictures & movies. I have some very professional depth of field shots off this camera. The t3i came out with the flip out LCD screen in which works great when filming or taking pics high or low from eye level. The camera before this one was the t2i, which did not have the flip out screen. This also has good 3x to 10x zoom you have to set up if you choose to go that route, I use this on occassions, so it's good to know you can do this. You do need extra batteries & lenses that will make this such a professional camera. The battery grip is another option that I personally needed & suggest to add more time to battery life, this doubles a single battery use. I feel this camera is best used in as much manual control as possible, the automatic functions are great... but ( OH ) the depth you can get into using manual control is never ending. I've takin some very breathtaking photo's on some half dead flowers outside my house & this camera made these flowers look so professional, I'm blowing up some of these to 19 by 24 photo's & you would have never known this was takin from half dead flowers... we are going to hang these up on our front entrance way to dining area. There is so much to the canon eos t3i, I can't even attempt to tell how much fun I'm having & purchasing more accessories with it... This was a great choice... Highly Recommend... A+A+A+A+.""
"20110705","5.0","Very Pleased","I'd consider myself to be an experienced amateur photographer, having for years shot with SLRs and medium format cameras, but this is my first digital SLR.I've been very pleased with the images and settings available on the T3i. I've been able to get great images shooting in aperture priority mode...and the learning curve was pretty short given my previous experience with both Canon SLRs and high-end digital point and shoots. The T3i has a nice grip, good battery life (but be sure to get yourself a couple extras anyway) and the flip out screen is great when you're shooting product photos on a low tripod, which I do a lot of.My only complaint is relatively slow auto-focusing in live view mode, but it's a minor annoyance.""
"20110705","5.0","Great Shopping Experience & Great Product","I have had my Rebel Ti3 camera and kit lens for about 3 weeks. I purchased an extra battery, remote and Tamron 70-300 lens, digital card, and two polarizing filters for the two lenses. Everything came promptly and in great working order. My wife and I had just finished re-landscaping our backyard with waterfalls, ponds, many varieties of flowers and flowering shrubs, and then invited our children and grand children for the 4th of July celebration. I expected the Ti3 to be amazing and it is. I made quite a jump from the fixed lens Canon Powershot professional 8 mgp. It was like entering a whole new world of photography! My experience with the extra f-stops, ISOs, lens stabilization felt like being let out of jail! The photos came out of camera requiring minimal tweaking in Photoshop; a real time-saver! I was very pleased with how well the built-in flash worked (the one that came with the PS Pro was feeble at best). I have a Canon 430 Speedlight and never needed it once, but as I begin to take more time with flowers and other macros, I look forward to using the Speedlight as a wireless flash. The most pleasant surprise, though, was the performance the Tamron zoom lens. WOW! Sharp at all focal lengths. I opted for this lens over the newer Tamron 18-270, which is considerably more compact, but the reviews showed significant compromise in sharpness as it zooms out. Although the 70-300 is BIG, it isn't too big, and it makes great photos! This was my retirement gift to myself. While I retired in January, I took my time on this purchase and glad I did.  Look, this was a great shopping experience from top to bottom. The Amazon website handled half the order directly but coordinated perfectly with the other three purveyors. Everything shipped and delivered on schedule. AND, I used $200 worth of points from my Amazon/Chase credit card against the purchase. It felt like family!""
"20110704","5.0","Great pictures","Love the tilting screen. One of the problems with digital cameras is that you cannot see the picture in bright sun. Problem solved with tilt screen and with view finder. My lens from my Canon Rebel 35mm camera work well on this camera. Wish I had bought camera without lens because I never use the one that came with camera. It is good for taking pictures inside since it has image stabilization but you need longer lens for outdoor shots across the baseball field. It you do not already have lens you will enjoy having the one that comes with camera. Very, happy with camera. It has more features than I will ever learn to use.""
"20110703","5.0","Good bye Micro Four Thirds! Thank you Canon.","I want this review to help those who appreciate good quality pictures and videos to capture family moments that can be viewed back without saying ' I wish the pictures were crisper and more colorful'. I am an avid home photographer with no desire to learn any more about my camera than to take pictures in the 'auto' mode that comes with cameras.I've always kept a Canon point and shoot and a Sony video cam (~2005) since my first child was born, and have great photos/videos marking many milestones. I held back from upgrading my DV Video cam to a HD video cam knowing that soon enough (2 years?), I would find a single device to take with me that does pictures and HD video. I started looking into such devices in 2010. I was glad I saw the Sony NEX 5 that had high reviews on dpreview.com. Went with it for Christmas when I had my favorite extended family members and their kids with me for the first time with my new born. It was meant to be a season to remember. Guess what? The pictures were too soft when compared to my previos Canon point and shoot. The HD video was better than my Sony DV camcorder though. But the pictures left me 'wishing'. Kept it for a couple more months while checking dpreview.com if new products that did pictures and HD video were out. Then came across the Olympus PEN EPL2. Sold my Sony Nex 5 for half-price and went for the PEN. Even with the PEN, I was found 'wishing the pictures came out better'. There were no other products that I wanted to try as I slowly was losing hope for one camera that did it all. Then came the Canon T3i.BOY! AM I GLAD I BOUGHT IT! This is a regular DSLR and bulkier than the Sony Nex 5 and Olympus E-PL2 which are Micro Four Thirds. But the pictures and video immediately delighted me. The colors were nicely reproduced. The flash lighting in indoor shots was excellent (a main draw-back with the Sony NEX 5 and Olympus Pen E-PL2). Most family shots are indoors and a good flash is necessary.I can say that I have stopped wishin for good pictures and instead enjoy the beautiful pictures from the Canon T3i with the kit lense. My search for a product that does both stills and video with great quality is complete.""

"20110630","5.0","Great Camera","I looked at many items before pulling the trigger on the Canon T3i. I went to Best buy and tested out the Canon T2i, the Nikon D5100, the Canon 60D, and the Nikon D7000. After testing out all the products I came to the decision that the only cameras I liked that felt good in my hand were the Canon T2i, Nikon D5100 and the Can T3i. I went for the T3i over the T2i because of the articulating LCD screen. I personally preferred the Canon T3i over the Canon T2i because of that one reason only, which is not a huge deal. The reason I chose the T3i over the Nikon D5100 was because of video manual focus on the Canon and also the Nikon D5100 does not have a built-in focus motor. I am sure the Nikon D5100 is a spectacular camera and it sports a larder image sensor than the Canon. I just felt in my opinion that the Canon T3i was the best deal at $789.99 with the lens kit.I took the camera out to the beach and tested it and was amazed by the Canon T3i quality. I literally took a picture of a surfer 75 Yards away with the kit lens, and was able to zoom in, in Photoshop and crop an up close beautiful detailed picture of the surfer. The quality is amazing I am upgrading from a Canon XSI and love it. I also took a picture of a cherry tree that was about 30 yards away, and then opened it up in Photoshop, zoomed in, and could see cherries that I could not even see with my eyes from the spot where I took the picture. I can not wait to get Canon 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 EF-S Zoom Lens and than I will be in some serious business.""
"20110628","5.0","You'll get what you paid for","Good camera.  I did a lot of research beforehand and asked friends about their experience.  This camera is what I expected so that's a good thing.""
"20110628","5.0","First time dSLR","Wow.  This camera is amazing.  This is my first dSLR camera and I might as well have never been taking pictures when I had my point-and-shoot.  I wanted a camera that was capable of actually taking useable pictures indoors and also have a touch of zoom on it.  This does both great.  I can't believe the quality and clarity indoors, even at night.  With hardly any lights on it can take crisp photos with ease.  I was able to zoom across a dimly lit 40-foot room, use the flash, and read the serial numbers off my camera's box!  Amazing.The standard flash seems to work pretty well.  I'll probably get an external flash eventually, but the one it comes with works great.  Seems to be pretty powerful.  I haven't tested it outside at night yet, though.I've only played with the video capabilities briefly.  You set it up by finding your focus point and then roll from there.  It keeps the focus well and only small adjustments are needed when depth in your focused subject changes.  Might take a little work knowing when and how to change the focus during some action shots but eventually the non-autofocus throughout the video could end up being a positive rather than a negative due to customizing capabilities.The camera seems solid, but very light.  I couldn't believe the difference between this camera and my dad's 60D (which had a smaller lens on his as well).  It seems significantly lighter.  I thought this was a great feature since I'll probably use the camera a lot on the go.The functions of the camera make sense.  While I'm just a beginner, there seems to be a lot of room to learn with the camera.  The ease of use is easy enough for my wife to follow without having to learn all the intricacies to shooting a manual shot.  Yet all the manual capabilities are there when you want it.The live view screen is large, bright, and crisp.  Very easy to read in any light setting.Overall, I LOVE the camera.  While I would probably love any dSLR just coming from a point-and-shoot, the features of this camera are what attracted me to it.  It is light, powerful, and easy to use with flexibility to grow.  With such a powerful sensor for pictures and 1080p video capabilities, I feel this camera will be in my bag for many years to come.""
"20110620","5.0","DSLR Newbie Top Pick","I'm a new DLSR user. I had my P&S for nearly 10 years (Canon of course), and I finally decided to take that leap into the big boy cameras. And I have to say, the T3i was truly the best pick for a beginner DLSR-er. My other option was the 5D Mark II, but it would have been too hi-tech for me (plus it does not come with a built-in flash), and not to mention $1200.00 more expensive.The Canon T3i is a perfect START for anyone who is not already familar with the DSLR cameras.The shutter sounds will need some getting used to, and auto-focus as well.I carry my camera everywhere I go, the pictures are fantasic. I would recommend getting a really good SD card to keep up with the camera. i.e. the Extreme III 32GB, which is much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else. There is also the Extreme sold at local Best Buy's 16GB, which was the 1st upgrade from my basic point and shoot SD card class 2. Go with class 10 all the way.""
"20120510","4.0","So Far So Good","I am still learning the camera but it is nice so far. I have owned many Nikon cameras including 35mm SLRs. This is my first Canon and I had my reservations. I plan to use it for astrophotography and there is a lot of support for the Canons so I went with the flow.The 18-135 lens 'feels' cheaply made. The focus ring is very loose. It does work though and I have taken some nice test shots.The camera is loaded with features but some are not that intuitive. I do read the manuals and about half-way through this one. The instructions are good. I will probably use this mostly in Manual mode but the other options are good.Access the memory card is nice. You can get to it with the camera on a tripod. The battery cannot be removed without taking the camera off the tripod.The kit includes a video cable and USB cable. I have not used them yet.The LCD is easy to read and the articulated feature makes it easy to see regardless of the position on the tripod.""
"20120509","5.0","Warning on T3i bundled software","I am so disappointed in the Canon decision not to support the older Powermacs with the newer software. The T3i bundled  software on the DVD will NOT run on an older Powermac, such as the G5's, which a LOT of us still use. Now, to use the T3i, an Intel powered Mac is required. What are they thinking?The software from the older Canon XTi for example, runs fine on a Powermac so you can use the 'Live View' function while shooting live in a light-box. Before you point out that there is a 'Live View' button on the T3i, let me just say there is no comparison looking at an image on a 24' inch screen.So the fix is to go with an inexpensive Window PC with XP Pro instead of investing in any more Macs and use the PC as a stand-alone station with the light-box. The cost comparison is astounding.Jesse""
"20120507","5.0","Perfect tool for film maker! Beats out the 60D","I'm using this camera for DSLR film making. I own both the D60 and D600 and this camera wins.-The D60 is far heavier, but the construction is exactly the same (same plastic/rubber). There's no justification for the added weight. Seriously canon, why is it so heavy? It's the same sensor and software.-The larger LCD is useless since you'll be mounting an LCD viewfinder on top anyway.-$300 price is totally not justified. Save the money for lenses or other gear.-The camera can shoot at 5.7fps (vs 3.1 on the D600), only useful for still photographers. Also, it can shoot at 1/8000 vs 1/4000, again, useless for film.I think most people who buy this camera are doing so purely because they believe it looks and feels more professional, they don't really understand it's the same hardware. My advice is either step up to a full frame body, or buy the T3I. The D60 is an odd one in the lineup, not sure what canon was thinking. They're charging 40% more for added weight.When someone talks about shooting film with a D60, I don't think 'professional'.  I think 'you don't really understand your camera.'""

"20120428","5.0","Perfect for the high quality pictures a novice is looking for","Was looking for an dSLR camera to purchase before my trip to Germany. This camera came highly recommended. I was torn between the T2i and this T3i. The main difference seemed to be the swivel screen. Luckily I found a good deal online for the T3i and am pretty happy i went with it. I am a tall guy (6'3') and the swivel screen is perfect for positioning the camera down and around in positions to get the best shot. Also, im paranoid about scratches on it so it is great to swivel it and snap in inwards to protect the screen.The picture quality is amazing. The pictures i got on the 'no flash' setting at sunset and nighttime in downtown Frankfurt will probably stick with me forever. The video is also rather easy to use and provides some good quality. Just need to focus as you go at times. I am a novice to put it lightly when it comes to photography so have not really tried too much with the more manual settings on the camera, but for all you novices out there looking for a quality dSLR to start out I would recommend this camera. Good quality photos, provided quick snaps and series on the right setting, and the canon software included is super easy and quick to use.""

"20120423","5.0","Cinema camera on a budget","The Rebel T3i is an excellent camera if you want good professional photography and professional movie making on a budget. I will note, however, some issues I have run into so you are aware they exist and plan accordingly.MOVIE MAKINGSome people (myself included) get this camera for the ability to shoot 24p, 30p and 60p movies through a large lens into a large sensor, which in the world of pro video cameras would cost you many times more, all the above being equal.POWEROne thing I would like to tell you from the start is that if you get a 6 battery add-on power pack for this camera, plan to use it for photos only. For movies, you will go through a battery magazine in a few minutes!Find the AC adapter to use the camera straight from wall power for movies. Such an adapter is available right here on Amazon to buy separately and it will save you lots of frustration, recharge waiting time and battery costs.FLASH (for photos)The MK off-camera remote flashes are well worth the investment, because they will give you the ability to capture amazing photos by experimenting with lighting, color, exposure and shadows.ENHANCEMENTSYou will focus manually when shooting movies with a DSLR, but that is OK because you want to use this camera especially for movie effects such as close-ups or dialogues while pulling focus. A follow-focus device will help here. They range from a few hundred dollars to a plastic strip with a handle on eBay for $14, and an upcoming '$50 follow focus' Hondo Garage project to be released soon. All the above devices other than the eBay cheap solution will require a $120-300 rig. To make your rig look impressive (if you film for clients) and to enhance your movie making ability, add a matte box that holds filters or at least one that works as a shade.Zebra stripes, HDR, more control, etcOne gray market utility that greatly enhances photo shooting and movie making is a firmware sidegrade called Magic Lantern. I've used it with no glitches.Tripod, dollyThink Ravelli and Peartree, both available here on Amazon.Lights and studio backdropsYou will want a perfect white, black and green background, and the key to success is good and ample lighting. Neweer and Cowboy Studio among others, here on Amazon.By now you're realizing that making movies on a Canon Rebel T3i is neither cheap nor hassle free. However, it beats spending $15,000 for a cinema camera that needs $600 storage media and a $3000 lens.The lens included in this kit (18-55mm) is excellent for most purposes, and appears to be a favorite for making movies. In pictures it has a slight corner distortion at the widest angle setting, which may go unnoticed unless someone's face happens to be there. Overall, considering the awesome savings and the ability to work like a movie director without a Holywood budget, highly, highly recommended.TIPIf you use another camera to capture other parts of your movie, and the T3i just for the high quality portions (close-ups, pulling focus, dialogues, faces, etc) then make sure you shoot at the same frame rate or close (if your other camera is 29.97 / 60i then use this camera at 30p (closest setting) and interpolate the footage from the other one so both are progressive before combining them. Also do a white balance on both cameras right before shooting.TWEAKINGThis Canon (with minor adjustments and a little patience) can match footage shot on most other cameras if you need to work with 2 cameras; at least it matches my Canon and Panasonic pro video cameras close enough so people can't tell that two or more completely different cameras were used.CONCLUSIONExcellent deal for photographers; a godsent for indie movie makers.""

"20110531","5.0","Outstanding picture quality","I feel I should state that I have been a point and shoot user my whole life, aside from a foray in photo club in high school. That said, I always had higher end point and shoots, and frequently put them in manual mode and such. As such, I am not comparing against competing models or lenses, just on what I see after upgrading from a point and shoot. Anyway...I have had this camera for about a week now and have taken a few thousand shots. I am absolutely blown away by the quality. After using the T3i, I feel like I have never actually owned a camera- all my previous cameras seem like useless toys. The control and ability that this camera gives you allow you to really take your pictures to the next level. I took outdoor action shots of my dog that I wouldn't even have attempted in the past. The colors that popped in my outdoor shots really captured my neighborhood in spring bloom. One somewhat unpleasant surprise is just how much detail was picked up- skin blemishes and dust in my house were all very visible! This camera will allow you to capture moments that you can frame on your wall forever, as opposed to the typical posed portraits that you are generally limted by with point and shoots.I upgraded to the 18-135mm lens, and it takes great shots and never requires you to dance around getting closer to a subject. The lens feels solid, and is not excessively large. I live on a bay, and was able to get nice shots of boats 1/4 -1/2 mile away without a problem. I also picked up the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens for indoor photography. For the $125 price, it is a great deal and takes considerably better indoor shots with lower light.""
"20110528","3.0","Slower than T2i!","I bought the T2i first, then decided to upgrade to the T3i.  For a period of two weeks, I had both cameras in my possession, so I could make a direct comparison, and decided hands-down that the T2i is the one I will keep.  Why?  The T2i is FAST.  I shoot my toddler in continuous mode, and the camera delivers the 3.7 fps it's supposed to.  It makes a huge difference knowing you can press the shutter and the camera will instantly take a picture.  The T3i, however, adds frequent and unpredictable delays when 'busy' flashes in the viewfinder and the red light is on -- even in continuous mode.I used the same exact settings on both cameras (large Jpeg, P-mode, Quick AF).  Compared to the instant responsiveness of the T2i, this was plain annoying and caused me to miss numerous shots.  I used the same class 10 SDHC chip in both cameras, but -- this is interesting -- even without any memory chip in the camera, the delays are still there.""
"20110516","5.0","Great camera for me","I am an amateur photographer. This is my first SLR camera. It takes great pictures even with low light. I haven't had time to check out all of the features yet or read all of the way through the Manuel. I have two other Canon cameras and much of the design is familiar to me. Because of the similarities it was easy for me to pick up the camera and use it right away. I like having the camera with me as I am always looking for great shots!""
"20110509","4.0","Canon T3i vs the Nikon D5100","Update: Heads Up, the new Sony NEX-5N is now giving the T3i Canon a powerful contender for less money. Pity there aren't enough lenses for it but that could change soon.The Canon T3i comes with the best lens in the market, far better than the D5100 kit lens. The Nikon kit lens is a soft lens, the Canon kit lens is ultra-sharp and it has a greater depth of field. Also Canon lenses are cheaper.Color reproduction is noticeably better on the T3i. The Nikon camera lacks saturation, specially in the red spectrum. Sunsets look completely wrong on the Nikon, dull and grey instead of yellow and red. However the Nikon D5100 performance in ultra low-light conditions is spectacular, the D5100 noise reduction is impeccable and beats the Canon Rebel by a long shot. This make the Nikon a better choice if you plan to use super-telephotos or shoot at night.The T3i photos look amazing as long as you keep your exposures between ISO 100-800 but the Canon T3i responds poorly at ISO 6400, no just noise but white 'hot pixels' ruin the image. Photoshop filters can remove some of the noise but are unable to remove the white pixels successfully and who wants to work that hard anyhow? For this reason I cannot recommend this camera for low-light shooting such as wedding photography (ie. inside a church)Warning to filmmakers: It is not impossible to shoot a movie with the Rebel T3i but it is extremely impractical and I question the sanity of people who would recommend DSLR cameras for movie production. You would be just asking for trouble. Instead, if you must shoot HD video with a still camera for some reason, just buy a Sony TX9 or TX10 for one third of the price, the 1080p video quality is the same and it offers continuous autofocus, oh, and it fits in your pocket, perfect for traveling.""
"20110509","5.0","Canon Beast","I have waited years to get a Digital SLR camera and after tons of research I chose the Canon T3i. My cousin and my buddy took pictures at my Maui Wedding...they both had the Ti & the T2i. The pictures turned out Awesome (it was Maui) you know. They loved their cameras, and I had to get one. I looked all over the internet for months. I finally pulled the trigger from Amazon, and I am very pleased. Great service from Shutterbug, and it arrived regular mail (free shipping) plus no tax! This is simply the best deal out there. I love this camera! Can't believe I waited this long.I have taken about 200 awesome pictures (well a few needed some work due to user error) but it am totally impressed so far. More to follow as soon as I can update you.""
"20110506","5.0","Excellent and versitile choice","I've been using Canon auto focus cameras for over 20 years and have been wanting a second camera body. I absolutely love the 6400 ISO on this camera. It makes for very nice and natural looking indoor photographs at gatherings.It uses a newer battery configuration than my older camera, and I think that was a poor decision on the part of the manufacturer as I cannot use some of my only slightly older accessories and need to carry around two sets of those accessories. Also had to purchase a new battery grip.I got it about 10 days ago and took a few hundred pix at a family wedding that did not have a pro-photog. It was a breeze to use, but like earlier models in the series.""
"20110504","5.0","Quite pleased with the Canon T3i","I researched several SLR's before deciding on the Canon T3i.  I'm happy with my choice so far, having purchased the camera first of all to take high quality photos of fairly small works of sculpture art, using the Canon 60mm macro lens.  For that use, the camera and lens seem to work very well.  I find the ergonomic arrangement of controls on the camera to very very intuitive and pleasant to use.  The camera feels solid and is easy to hold with the very adequate right hand grip that has a rubberized cover allowing the user to maintain a firm grip.  The menu system for adjusting camera settings is also well designed and easy to use. The adjustment wheel just behind the shutter button makes changing settings very simple when in manual mode. I especially like the articulated LCD screen on the back of the camera that allows it to be positioned so that otherwise very awkward camera positions (ie, overhead, or low to the ground) are easily possible.  The view finder is very clear and has all basic settings info on the bottom border.  The camera comes with a comfortable, good quality neck strap and is quite light and small compared to other SLRs. Battery life seems to be very good - longer than I expected.  The included corded battery charger will appeal to some, but not to those who prefer the travel type charger with a swing-out plug.  This is not a professional level SLR, but it performs very well as a small, light APS-C camera.""
"20110501","5.0","Simply Awesome","A long time ago I used Canon's AE1's (35mm) for semi-pro photography. A while back I decided I missed taking pictures. Sure my phone as an 8mp camera but it really isn't a camera. Point and shoots are great for snapshots but you can't take real photos with them. I took a chance with the T3i after reading reviews and doing some research. I wanted to stick with Canon as they always treated my right in the past. I was blown away from the FIRST picture (of the parking lot at Best Buy). If you are on the fence buy this camera now. It went well beyond my expectations. Big pros for me are: It's lightweight, it's fast and the auto focus is almost perfect everytime. The cons are: none. Buy a large SD card you will need it...""
"20110421","5.0","Awesome Camera!!!","Like many other interested purchasers I struggled making the decision to go with the T3i. I'm definitely glad I opted for this camera. The most noticeable feature, the articulating LCD, is far more than a little add-on to me, since I have an issue with positioning myself to use a fixed position live view, much less the viewfinder when the camera is in some locations. The ability to use an external mic for stereo video sound is another great feature. The available settings & options seem nearly limitless to me at this point. Among the many other highlights is the quality of the 18 MP resolution. Since I just received the camera a week ago, I plan to update this review when I have more time with it.I went from a Canon XTi to this model and the transition has been totally AWESOME. I would strongly recommend the T3i to all of my friends.""
"20110419","5.0","Great for HD Video","You can find dozens of professional reviews of this camera online so I won't try and repeat the same extensive detail.  I just want to say that the camera has been great to me and it takes amazing video.  My suggestion for a first lens is either the 50mm canon 1.8, or the Sigma 30mm 1.4 if you can afford it.  The kit lens is garbage for anyone but an absolute beginner.""

"20110404","5.0","The best entry SLR you could ask for","From the few days I've owned this camera, I can tell you I'm very happy with it. My wife and I wanted to start learning advanced photography and move-up from our point-and-shoot Canon Digital Elph 8900.First we were thinking Nikon, but I can safely say after experimenting with most Nikons that you wouldn't understand half of what the camera can do.Then the salesperson showed us this camera, the T3i. I loved the built in 1080 video, adjustable screen, and most importantly, the fact that Canon has made it extremely easy to use.Each mode has a 1-2 sentence explanation on the screen telling you when you'd want to use that mode. What I also like is that it's not too basic; meaning, you won't outgrow it right away.Granted I've only owned mine for a few days, . . . so far, I can say that you should absolutely strongly consider this model if you're in the same position that my wife & I have found ourselves in.""
"20110322","5.0","First-time DSLR","I have had the camera 2+ days. Finally upgraded from standard point-and-shoot. The camera is awesome so far. Very happy with the purchase, and look forward to learning about better photography.Recommended as a first-time DSLR, the T3i has ample features. There is so much to do with this camera. As soon as I learn one feature, it's on to the next exciting one. Takes gorgeous photographs. Just last night, I took some outstanding low-light shots that were exciting for a newbie like me, and would not have been do-able with a standard point-and-shoot.I really like the swivel on the live view when doing video clips, which was another reason I chose this camera over competitive models. You can use the live view to shoot stills as well, but I'm trying to learn the manual features and the viewfinder to get better acquainted with the camera. Just an FYI, you will need an SDHC card with a Series 6 rating or higher to do video. You can get a 16GB card on Amazon for a reasonable price.The stock lens seems to be fine as I am learning to use the camera. I plan on upgrading the lens once I get more comfortable with it. Again, there are some good values on Amazon for Canon lenses (just search 'Canon Lens' and you'll see the most popular buys).In closing, I took a long time to research and decide whether or not getting into a DSLR was worth it for me. Having now made the purchase, I can say without hesitation that it was well worth the money. Especially for a beginner like me, the T3i is a great camera.""
"20110321","5.0","Busy Mom/The Family Photographer - T3i a great intro dSLR","I am not a camera expert, but rather, I'm a busy mom who likes to take pictures and who adores my subjects. This, then, is a review from a busy mom/amateur's point of view.MY GOALS/EXPECTATIONS:I have always been a photo fiend, taking my camera everywhere and pulling it out at any opportunity. While I'd gotten to a decent level of archiving important moments with my point-and-shoot cameras over the years, I wanted to take my photography to the next level. I was inspired by my brother-in-law's photos of his kids to take the dSLR plunge. But I knew (and still know), very little about professional photography. I wanted to start taking better photos right away. But I also wanted to have room to grow as a photographer and a camera that would grow with me.I also wanted the focus to stay firmly on my family - while I was willing to invest some time and care into the camera, I didn't want it to become like a pet I had to constantly watch over. While any dSLR takes some care and consideration, I've found the T3i has been an excellent camera for me and I've been quite pleased with it.PROS:* VERY USER FRIENDLY: The auto mode (or auto without flash, my favorite) is highly forgiving, taking fantastically sharp images, true to color. They look so clear that I feel I'm capturing as close to real life as I've ever seen before in a camera.* FAST: While I sometimes go in for trying out new modes and manual settings, I often leave the camera in auto or auto-sans-flash mode and just click away so that I can at least capture a moment before it's gone. I then play with manual settings if my kids stay still long enough for me to try something new. My previous cameras always had a horrible delay for the autofocus (the only mode they usually had), meaning I nearly always lost the moment when the toddler was on the move. The t3i is so ridiculously fast that I can snap multiple pics in the time one picture took before.* BEAUTIFUL PICTURES: This kind of goes without saying at this tier of camera, but the pictures are just amazing quality. Coming from the land of point-and-shoot, I'm pretty blown away. And I know I'm only touching the tip of the iceberg for what's possible.* BEAUTIFUL VIDEO: This is the nice new feature of the t3i. I wasn't sure I'd want or need the HD video. But hey, when you've got it, you use it. I've gotten some amazingly clear footage of the kiddo playing in the park with daddy and I'm so glad we went for the model with that feature.* BIG, CLEAR DISPLAY: It's really easy to see what pics you've just taken and adjust your photo-taking accordingly. Just by seeing what I've gotten, I'm able to try again and improve a shot almost immediately.* CLEAR MENUS/ABILITY TO IMPROVE: The interface on this is so intuitive that I've been able to learn a lot without even cracking open the manual (though that manual is my new reading material). The entry point for a new user is just a step up from normal photography - the possibilities, however, are nearly endless.* NICE KIT LENS: For all that photographers get into new and better lenses, the kit lens on this is really nice and easy to use. I think it will hold us for a good long while before I get to be more of an expert. It gives me the range of zoom and focus I need for now.* EYE-FI COMPATIBLE: WOW. I cannot even tell you how much this busy mom loves this feature. If you get an eye-fi card, your pictures can be set up to automatically upload to your computer whenever you are within range of your synched wireless network. My husband set up a SmugMug account and the eye-fi capabilities. I take pics to my heart's content while out on walks, in the park, etc., and come home, then leave the camera on (auto-shut off after 8 minutes) to upload the pics. I can then tag and sort pictures later at my leisure. For a busy mom, this is amazingly useful. I don't have to take time out to upload the pics - the camera does that for me.* BATTERY LIFE (for common use): So far, the battery we bought for the camera lasts very well during normal photo-taking. It's just a standard Canon battery for the rebel line and it charges quickly. Even when taking pics like a mad-woman, it lasts through a shoot. HD video eats it up more quickly, so be warned. Still, I rarely run out of juice during the day so long as I pop the battery into its charger in the evening. However, uploading is another story (See below in cons).Those are just the first few things I love about this camera. Here, however, are the...not cons, really, just challenges for a busy mom:CHALLENGES:* dSLRs ARE EXPENSIVE, DELICATE, BIG AND BULKY:And busy parents' lives have enough precious and delicate things to worry about - namely, the kids. No getting around it - you can't just toss a dSLR into a pocket and go. I'm in a quest for a good bag/carrying solution (heh, yeah, wish me luck with that.) and I'm trying to get used to having one part of my brain keeping an eye on the camera as well as keeping the majority of my focus on the kids. When I'm in photo-journalist mode, it's no problem, but switching back to mom-mode is the hard part. I've already seen the camera knocked onto the ground (a very short distance onto very soft ground, so it was okay, but still, the experience practically gave me a heart attack) and once, when bending over, I caught the toddler on the temple with the kit lens (She sobbed. I felt so awful!) This thing requires constant awareness to both the camera AND the kids when using it. I'm quickly adjusting, but if you're not totally committed to learning to use and love the dSLR, you may want to stick to really good point-and-shoot camera if you're a busy parent.^ That's really the big one.* BATTERY LIFE (when uploading pics via eye-fi): Uploading pictures by eye-fi seems to eat the battery alive. It appears that the camera won't autoshutoff when uploading, so this morning, after a few hours of uploading big, glorious pictures to my SmugMug account, the battery finally ran out of juice. I wish there was a plug-in mode or some sort of docking-station I could plug the camera into when I return home. If it's only a few pics, they upload and the camera shuts itself off. But if it's a bunch of pics (and when the weather's nice and the lighting's good, I take a lot of pics), the camera requires a battery recharge just to finish uploading my pictures.* SWIVEL SCREEN WORRIES: I find that the swivel screen, while hugely useful, is something I constantly worry that I'm going to snap off. However, you can keep it closed with the screen facing in(a nice feature) or tuck it onto the camera with the screen facing out. I also find if I'm looking out of the eye-piece, I leave cheek smudges all over the screen when its facing out.* MANUAL-MODE GOOFS: Some of my manual mode forays have been less than stellar. I've taken a shot - set up so nice, focus just perfect, subject just so... only to find out I left it in white-balance adjustment for indoors and I was outdoors so the whole picture looks like I dipped it in blue. I've learned to take pics in auto-mode first before experimenting too much. I also learned to check the screen a LOT before proceeding.SUMMARY: While the dSLR has required me to make some adjustments for including it in my busy life, I really love this camera, am pleased with the investment, am inspired by its ease of use, and I LOVE the pictures I've gotten of my family.5 STARS: And so I give it 5 stars - my whole point in buying a nice camera was to make and preserve FAMILY memories - and the t3i records those memories beautifully - in .jpg, raw, or HD video - with a minimum of dSLR fuss.*** UPDATE: about 6 months later ***STILL AWESOME:  I totally stand by the above review. If anything, I've come to adore this camera even more than I did when we first got it. When baby #2 arrived, the quality of pictures that we got far surpassed the pictures from the first baby's photo shoots. I'm truly pleased with this investment, as the pictures we get are lovely, clear, true-to-light/true-to-color, and just capture the memories so well. Really, this is EXACTLY what I was hoping for as an amateur photographer/mom.GOT BETTER:Battery Woes: We invested in an A/C adapter for the camera and now no longer eat the battery alive when leaving the camera to upload pictures via the Eye-Fi connection. It's a little annoying to have to swap over to the A/C and then back to a battery all the time - I would rather have a charging station of sorts - but it works and it means I stick the battery in the charger so it's almost always ready to go.Ease of Use: I adjusted to using this thing pretty quickly. I invested in a LowePro FastPack 250 and it works nicely as a diaper-bag/day bag/camera bag. Not the most attractive purse, but it works well. I'm much better at being ready for any photo situation now.Swivel Screen: No problems to report. I just leave it screen out all the time.SAME: Awesome camera all around. Truly, truly impressive. There might be higher tiers of quality out there, but for what I use in following the kids around, this captures amazing shots quickly. Love it.GOT (just a little) WORSE:Eye-Fi Annoyance: This is going to differ from person to person, but our Eye-Fi stuff has had some kinks to work out. The card we bought required several updates lately, then we had to change SmugMug account stuff, but the changed password meant Eye-Fi couldn't upload. Blah, blah, blah, I'm sure most of the problem is ME not getting the changes my hubby made. Still, Eye-Fi is usually automatic, but from time to time, it requires maintenance and understanding from all parties uploading stuff. Just be warned, it isn't so automagical as I hoped it would be.Other than that ^ though, awesome camera. I'm truly loving it. On the whole, a Lotta camera for Low maintenance.""
"20110320","4.0","Awesome but I am knocking down a star because...","They applied cripple-by-annoyance to motivate upsales.What I mean by that is they intentionally decided to look for ways to make people want their more expensive cameras, since the sensor technology has gotten so good that this is just as good as the 7D optically (there are some metering differences etc. but really...those aren't hard to overcome). And one way they found to do just that is by making the camera make far more noise than it needs to when doing continuous shooting.There is a mirror lockup feature, and there is a live view mode which locks up the mirror, and there is a continuous shooting mode which better photographers will use especially in this day of essentially unlimited exposure memory. The mirror lockup is intended to minimize vibration by keeping the mirror in place when the shutter releases, but it will also keep things quiet during continuous shooting, where you are machine-gunning off tons of shots in rapid sequence.Sadly, this otherwise nearly perfect camera decides to flip the mirror up and down every single shot of a continuous sequence, and despite all those settings available, none of them are allowed to work. That makes this product embarrassing to use in a quiet space! What company wants to embarrass people for using their product?!?This is why people have created 3rd party firmware for these cameras called Magic Lantern. It's buggy and I don't know if it fixes this particular cripple but they might put it in if people ask. I have not loaded it into my camera but this sort of thing really tempts me.Otherwise this camera is totally awesome for the money. I would also like to be able to zoom in on the image preview (the view of your image that comes up right after you take the picture) which oddly was available on some of Canon's point-and-shoots from years ago. That would let me see quickly if I got sharpness. For video, I would like to be able to completely clear the screen of distractions...there is a white rectangle showing where zooming will happen that I can't seem to get rid of. I would also like to have the histogram available while I'm filming video, and an edge finder feature for focus (see some high-end Marshall LCD monitors).The Digital Zoom 3x-10x is bolted on, requiring a vulcan neck pinch to get going...I sense they weren't sure of this feature, there were bitter arguments about it, not least of which because it's explosive to their product line. Not only is it their only DSLR that offers it right now, I have done the tests and discovered that the 3x digital zoom avoids Canon's achilles heel of DSLR video: It no longer does line skipping when at 3x! This means that the aliasing and moire that dogs all Canon DSLR video at this time (they need to implement a simple anti-aliaser for video capture...c'mon guys) is solved on the T3I/600D as long as you are zoomed 3x. The reason is obvious, it's just using the center pixel sensors rather than the entire 18MP sensor...so it's only working with ~2MP natively and doesn't have to drop anything. This image is great, but when you multiply 3x time 1.6x crop sensor you need a very wide angle lens to work this way without line skipping.I am sure they are withholding anti-aliasing for two reasons: 1) they want to make it exclusive to their high-end cameras first, and those have a longer product cycle, and 2) there must be bitter acrimony within the company about the DSLR division eating the video division's lunch. Nikon et al. will eat Canon's lunch if Canon doesn't eat its own as lunch...that's why we have this great camera, and that's why Canon is going to have to serve us all with uncrippled products soon enough. Just bite the bullet and let the high end products sell themselves on their own intrinsic merit Canon!""

Let me just say excellent professional looking shots are pretty easy with this camera, and I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing an SLR camera.  I love the 18-135mm lens, as I'm usually just taking pictures of my wife and kid with it, seems as if I don't need any other lens.

My husband was drying our pretty Papillon, I was laying on the bed, taking pics upside down, why, cuz I could! I love how you can take pics at just about every which way your laying, standing, whatever way, its great! Since the SLR is new to me, I have some learning, but so far, it's GREAT.

"20110303","5.0","Works great!  Amazing in low light and awesome video recording.","I purchased this camera mainly for recording video.  Its quality is amazing, and the on-board mic records great to me as well.  For anyone wondering about the new HD digital movie zoom, I created a video demonstrating its quality and the microphone quality as well!  Its on youtube.  Just search for t3i digital zoom and onboard mic test.  Check it out and let me know what you think in the comments!On a side note, I would not recommend purchasing the Patriot LX series 32gb class 10 SDHC card.  I ordered one of these from newegg and when I received it, it did not work properly with the camera due to old firmware on the card.  Patriot has confirmed this over the phone, as the issue started with the T2i.  Apparently they fixed it in there new cards, but old ones are still out there!  I did order the Transcend 32gb class 10 and it is currently working fine at the moment.I Highly recommend getting a wireless remote.  I picked up a brand called Shoot, here on amazon and works great for videos as well if you do not have anyone to operate the camera for recording.Also the battery grip here on amazon fits perfect on the T3i and gives it a nice solid feel and increases stabilization.

"20120417","5.0","LOVE this camera!!","Coming from an ameture's POV rather than an expert, I really LOVE this camera. I had previously done a lot of research because I was looking for something a little better than the point-and-shoot digital camera's. Here are some things I noted:- Being a DSLR, this camera is a bit heavy, especially if you're using a telephoto lens. This doesn't terribly bother me because it does not feel 'cheap' in any way. To note, the T3 actually feels lighter than the T3i.-I am REALLY a fan of the swivel screen which is newly introduced in this model. As others have said, I do fear accidentally bumping it and snapping it off but I really do like it. Plus, you can rotate it around so the screen is against the camera to protect it from scratches when not in use.-Picture quality blew me away. Even before I knew the right settings, just using the auto, this camera handles color really wonderfully. I have taken several outdoor photos with my dogs in the grassy backyard and the grass is a beautiful bright and vibrant hue. No photoshop edits necessary! :)-The camera itself actually has a few image filters you can apply to your photos after you take them. They're fairly simplistic but a neat addition.-The battery life when taking photos (and not using live view) is really fantastic compared to typical point and shoot digital cameras. Since the camera does not take photos with live view  (unless you turn on the setting) I've gotten many photos before having to recharge.-The exception to the above: If recording video, especially in HD, that REALLY eats the battery life up. I probably only get a few hours out of the battery if recording straight video.-I found that it was really easy to learn the functions of this camera, and although I don't know them all, it has great functions and modes both for professionals and beginners. Even just using the auto modes and letting the camera decide the settings, it works fantastic.-I am not a huge fan of the built in flash. Though I've read that most built in flashes on cameras aren't great, I usually do not use it unless it's really needed. In good light, the camera really performs great without it. Images with the flash tend to be blown out or too dim (if you adjust the brightness)-The display screen is really gorgeous (and large). Really the best way I can put that. It's a lot more crisp and clear than my other point and shoot digital cameras.-This model, as opposed to the T3 which does not, has a built in sensor to use wireless remotes (which I also purchased) Just wanted to point that out.-One thing I can't seem to figure out (and I'm not sure if it's a computer issue or not), when uploading pictures (by plugging in the camera into the computer with the cord provided), it takes FOREVER for my computer to recognize the camera. At first I thought it was because I hadn't installed the software that came with it, so I did that. It still takes at least a minute or two before the software will open up and allow me to download the images.  That's truly my only beef which may NOT have anything to do with the camera itself.Overall I would definitely recommend this to any beginners looking to get their first DSLR. It's a higher end beginners DSLR for a fairly affordable price and if you keep an eye out for those Amazon deals, you can snag a nice bundle. I've had mine for about 5 months now and I absolutely love it!""
"20120417","5.0","Awesome Camera and Great Lens","I have only had the T3i for a week but it is an amazing camera. It does everything I want plus more. The quality of the pics and video is amazing. There are unlimited features in which to utilize this great instrument in like HD video with internal/external audio, camera able to use both internal/external flash, sports mode, or just point and shoot auto. I got the 18-135mm kit lens with mine because I just wanted the ease of having a one size fits all scenarios lens. The lens does great under any circumstance you desire to shoot or film. I am not a professional photographer but have been a amateur hack for over 30 years and this is by far the best camera I have ever owned. The technology put into this camera makes amateur pics look very professional. The buttons, menus and info functions are actually simple to navigate and program after reading the manual and testing a few times. I love the LCD and how it can be opened and positioned. You won't go wrong choosing the T3i or the 18-135mm lens.""
"20120416","3.0","At least a lap behind Nikon D5100","I am an experienced still photographer, beginning to shoot movies. I already had a Nikon D5100 and love it. I needed a second camera for moviemaking and decided to try the EOS Rebel T3i, so I bought one and have been using it for a couple of months alongside the Nikon. It's okay for full-motion HD video, with somewhat more control over exposure than the Nikon.For still photography, it sucks. One of the motivations for a DSLR instead of a pocket digital camera is the expectation that the DSLR will take the picture when you press the button. The Canon T3i doesn't. The Nikon always does. This difference is infuriating. Any decent photographer knows when to take the picture. If the camera waits a couple of milliseconds--or full seconds, in the case of the Canon T3i--you can't capture the moment.It's also cheaply made, compared with the Nikon--all kinds of minor shortcuts to reduce the cost.I'm not sorry I bought it, but I am more than a little disappointed and will use the Nikon as my primary camera, with the Canon as a backup for movies, and leave it in the camera bag when I am shooting stills.""

"20120331","2.0","Bad Warranty and Customer Service. Lens Fix Scam","Just got off Canon's website. The camera is fine but my lens had some problems with reaching an f-stop of 3.5, it would go no lower than 4.5. This made it a little difficult to shoot in low lit environments. Canon doesn't seem to honor their warranty. I went on their website and everything was fine. They gave me an RMA slip to ship with the lens. I shipped my lens to the factory and received a fix it ticket for about as much as the lens itself. I paid for my shipping expecting some help from Canon with a price tag of $0(RMA price), only to get a response that it will cost me $100. I can buy a new lens for $50 more. Why buy Canon lenses when they do not support their product.The camera works fine, I am pretty happy for the price, especially for video. But I would avoid their products from now on.

"20120315","4.0","I wish I'd realized that with DSLRs you don't use the screen as a viewfinder","I bought this one instead of the cheaper T2i because of the flip-out screen.I had not had a DSLR before, so I didn't realize that when you use the screen to focus, you lose all the fancy auto-focus stuff that is above on the viewfinder.DSLRs are really designed to be used with the viewfinder. That's where all the good stuff is. When you switch to using the screen like you would with a point-and-shoot, the autofocus is much less sophisticated and slower. So, I do not use it much, and hence do not really make use of the fold-out screen.Other than that it is a great camera as everyone else has mentioned.You will want to get a better strap, as the one it comes with will make your neck sore pretty quickly.""

"20120309","5.0","My first SLR, amatuer!","Received this as a gift (it was bought @best buy but it's cheaper here!) and felt compelled to share my initial reaction to the T3i. I've been wanting an SLR camera for a while but could never decide on one. Well when I received this as an anniversary gift, the decision had been made for me. I was considering a Nikon so I was a little worried at first but I immediately took it out of the box and started messing around with it. First thing I noticed was that the controls were easy to navigate for someone like myself who never used an SLR and the pictures taken just fooling around looked really nice. I read parts of the little booklet to see how to get the image screen to come on as I was not used to taking photos through just a viewfinder. After a while though, I actually had fun using the viewfinder, it has 9 points of focus. However I would probably turn on the view screen if I were to ask someone to take a photo for me, because it's more like a point and shoot and easier for most folks. I did this at a family gathering and the in-laws appreciated using the view screen.  Either way the photos come out extremely well. My husband usually takes terrible pics no matter what, on all of our cameras, which he readily admits. They're usually out of focus, dark or just bad, we don't know how they turn out that bad but they do. But he's been able to take plenty of good ones with this, which in my book is pretty amazing! Switching between MF and AF is very easy as well, there is a switch on the side of the lens near the button that disengages the lens. Using this camera is much easier than I imagined. It came with the EF-S 18-55 and my hubby got the EFS 55-250 for me as well. So far I have been using the 18-55 but the 55-250 worked well for some photos I took in the expansive lobby at the Grand Calfornian. I'm still learning about the camera and plan on buying the guide for this specific camera that is sold here on amazon. I will try to update my review after I get a macro lens and have it for a little while longer. I added some photos of a mother hummingbird and her 2 babies that I have shot for the past week in my yard using the 18-55. I know this review might not be helpful for the experienced but for the amateur I hope it helps. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this camera especially if you are new to SLR photography.""
"20120309","5.0","BEST CAMERA EVER","I purchased this after much consideration between the T2i, the 60D and this, the T3i had the flip out screen for above shot viewing. They all seem to have the exact same sensor, the only difference being the size, mirror actuation speed and image processors. this fit my budget perfectly. I upgraded to this from a Rebel XS, and a major difference was the lightning fast focus speed and the video capability. this is the best camera for the money (in my opinion) HANDS DOWN""

"20120302","4.0","Great Camera with a few drawbacks for video","Great camera for shooting still photos. The quality is superb and low-lighting is a breeze (as soon as you get used to working the correct settings).The main reason I chose the T3i was for the 1080p video is offers. The video quality is great, but there are a few things to be aware of.1) You'll want to get a memory card rated at a 10 for speed, and make sure it's a good-quality brand. If you scrimp on the card you'll forever be hitting yourself when the video recording repeatedly stops for no apparent reason. I have been through three cards that don't cut it (three different brands). Make sure you shell out the money for a quality card or you won't be able to record the data fast enough for 1080p (particularly in bright lighting or when you have a light source in the background--like a TV or lamp).2) The camera does not auto-focus while recording video which can be really annoying. If you do any panning or zooming you will find yourself constantly toggling the manual focus on your lenses. Most DSLRs are the same, but I made an unwise assumption that this one would be different since they seemed to solve many of the conventional video problems DSLRs have.3) If you use an external video monitor while shooting video, plan on 480i resolution. The second you push the record button on the camera, the 1080p output signal changes to 480i (DVD quality video) instead of 1080p (High Def). This is not a problem at all if you don't use an external monitor, but is really annoying if you do.4) Sound quality from the built-in mic is not good. I use external mics, so this is not an issue for me, but if you depend on the built-in mic for your audio you might find yourself sorely disappointed. Still, it does okay for home video in a pinch, but for professional-quality video you'll want to purchase an external mic.All-in-all, this is a fantastic camera for still photos and a great camera for video quality/clarity. It is a little weak on the video recording features, but...what can we expect from a DSLR, right?I would definitely recommend this camera for anyone in the market for a camera in this price range. If I had a little extra to spend for a DSLR I would recommend a Canon 7D. If I were to purchase solely for video I would recommend a Canon HF G10. Yeah, I'm a Canon fan. Canon makes good quality optics without too many proprietary accessories (like Sony).""

"20120225","1.0","Slow and disappointing","I wish I had looked at reviews more closely before buying this camera. The automatic settings are useless. The auto focus takes along time to focus as it whirs in and out before settling on a slightly blurry image. And if anything in the picture moves it has to go through the whole 10second process again. Pictures that are focused come out looking bland and cheap. Our Sony point and shoot gives a better picture. I have three friends with Nikons. The 5100D in a similar price range seems to take better quality pictures that don't over expose. I may have a faulty one but looking at reviews there seems to be a lot of faulty Canon's out there.""

I was nearly terrified I was going to damage the camera each time I used it and I never going to be able to take the best pictures.After taking it on a recent vacation, I can not speak more highly of this camera.  The picture quality is through the roof, easy of use and learning the menus couldn't be easier, and it is rather rugged.  I took the camera kayaking, biking, hiking, to the swimming pool, on the beach, and everywhere else.One con is I feel that with the camera in auto-mode it over uses the flash which can drown out the picture quality, but that is easily handled by turning the built in flash off.""

Even when I see people with 7D's and 5DMKII's, I am still thoroughly happy with this camera. I even wrote some articles on my blog about it.Why I like it:1 - light-weight... yes, most pros will decry the plastic body, but for me, I've begun to see this as a plus. The camera is a lot lighter than the Canon metal bodied cameras, and has survived a couple nasty falls with no damage. I try to shoot with a tripod as much as possible, but most of the time, I just don't have time to mess with a tripod - the lighter weight helps.2 - Specs are more than just 'good enough'... the specs, when lined up with the 7D are still quite impressive. The only real trade-offs are slightly slower bursts, and a few less focus points. Sensor sizes are nearly identical, and they share the same processor - leading me to believe the t3i's slightly lowered specs are artificial software limits.3 - It's versatile... it does great for both video and stills, even boasting a few better features not found on the 7D (or even 5DMKII for that matter). Also, if you are bold enough to try the Magic Lantern firmware add-on you really get your money's worth - especially for video.""
