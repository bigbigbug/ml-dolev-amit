"20120611","2.0","Great until it breaks","It would be 5 stars... but after about 6 months the lens cover started sticking and wouldn't fully open or fully close.  I sent it back to Canon and they replaced under warranty with a refurbished camera.  Good customer service, it took about a week to get it replaced.  The replacement worked great for about 8 months, then it happened again, sticking lens cover. I sent it back to Canon hoping they might replace it again even though it was a couple of months out of warranty.  No luck, they will charge $147 to repair it.  I can replace it for not much more than that.  But since it lasts for only 6 to 8 months, it's time to search for a more reliable camera.  Bummer, it was great while it lasted.""
"20120611","5.0","Best buy for your money","I purchased this after doing a lot of research and even returning the Elph 310. I decided that the 'upgrades' from the 300 to 310 weren't worth anything. Also, the 300 has a wider angle lens, which is more desirable. This is so small I take it every where with me, and can always snap a shot of my little one. It is even comfortable to hold, but I do have small hands. It takes great shots for a point and shoot. The only thing to know is that it does have its limitations. In low light(like inside a house) sometimes I have to stabilize it well or else I get blurry pics of my toddler. But the camera does warn you if that is going to happen. Still, the convenience of having it when I want it outweighs any negatives. The five stars is for this price range. Obviously a digital SLR will take much better pictures.""
"20120610","4.0","Canon Elph 300 HS","Bought at the time it was just coming out, and thinking I was upgrading from my Sony w290, and going to Canon, I had very high expectations. I remember the 'wow' factor was not there at first use.Now, over a year has passed and feel its a good camera. The performance in low light is very good and by far the best improvement I had over my last camera. But I see colors are a little more dull on this camera's photos than the ones my Sony produced (in daylight).The HD video looks great and you have the ability to zoom in/out. Overall this is a great camera and for the price now is a great choice.""
"20120609","2.0","Poor low light photos","I bought this camera as a replacement for a SD600 6 megapixel canon elph that was 6 years old.  Taking photos outdoors and in good natural light were comparable to the old camera.  photos taken indoors when the sun was beaming through the windows were yellow in color and not nearly as vibrant as the old camera.  I tried experimenting with the settings for a little while then gave up because the 'automatic' setting should work without having to read the manual (just like the old camera).  In my opinion canon missed the mark with this camera.  I've already returned it.""
"20120608","5.0","Great camera","Fits anywhere and I am amazed at the functionality. I was a little confused when the zoom went up to 24 power as I thought the camera was only a 5x. Zoom up to 5x is optical, then digital beyond that.""

It is easy to use, I can upload pictures from the camera to my computer with ease; it takes sharp, clean pictures, and is excellent for carrying in my small purse! The only issue would be re-charging the batteries - seems to charge down in a shorter time than I would prefer. I have only had the camera for approx 2 months and have already charged it twice and I don't use it everyday. Other than that, it is GREAT, I highly recommend.""

"20120604","1.0","major design flaw","My new Canon Powershot ELPH 300HS camera had all the characteristics I wanted in a small pocket camera, but it only lasted 13 months (just past the 1-year warranty) before a dark smudge appeared on every image, always in the same spot.Cleaning the lens didnt help, but web research revealed this as a common problem. It is caused by dust leaking through the zoom lens joints and finding it's way onto the CCD image sensor. There is no way to fix it yourself. You could send it to a repair center but you cant get a fixed estimate of cost and must pay $100 up front.  Canon wont address this product design flaw after the 12 month warranty. Yuk.!3 months is too short a life. I wont buy a Canon product again. My previous Canon developed a lazy lens flap which didnt always open completely, ruining numerous shots. Same response from Canon on that common problem as well: it's not our problem.""
"20120604","4.0","great little camera - but cheaper elsewhere","A compact camera that does a great job, with a 5X zoom lens, which is fairly fast at it's wide end (f/2.7) a great wide angle for indoor shots and very good low light performance. The only thing I did not like is the sometimes choppy zoom control. I really liked the metal body with a rough finish that allows us to maintain a good grip on the camera. Another plus is the dedicated video record button and e zoom automatically skews down when you go to video mode.One thing to note is that this is priced $30 less at my local big box store. Even with sales tax it beat the $167 price on Amazon - and I am a Prime customer who buys lots of things from them.""
"20120603","2.0","Is dissapointing","My ex got the Lumix LZ3 in the divorce. It was a nice camera, but rather bulky for many occasions. I'd long wanted a super compact and this seemed to fit the bill, especially when it was on major sale at another establishment. Due to the price I paid, I almost gave this three stars, but found I couldn't recommend it at any price.On the plus side, the camera is very compact, very well built and has a very nice wide angle lens. I haven't used the HD video often, but it is much better than my old Lumix, though still has problems (see below). I actually like the simplicity of the settings, though the inability to easily override the basic settings has occasionally been a problem.On the negative side; the white balance is horrid. It will change even between consecutive pictures, especially in bright sunlight or low light. This happens with the HD video as well. It is quite annoying to be shooting a video of my granddaughter, shift the camera slightly and have the picture go yellow.(By comparison the Lumix was grainy and had poor color in low light, but in medium light and bright sunlight, the color was dead on. I miss that, especially at pools, the beach or the like.)The delay between pictures is excruciating at times. Sometimes it simply won't take a picture. I press the button, nothing happens, press it again, nothing happens, moment passes. Finally I can take a picture. Granted, this is common with digital cameras, but with Elph 300 HS seems worse than any I've used in this regard.The auto-focus is just plain weird. It's supposed to identify faces and focus on them. That works maybe half the time; the other half, it focuses on the most random things. On the other hand, you can force the focus point and it will track it correctly.I'm neutral on the flash. I've actually found it to be better than many other digital cameras I've used and I have fewer red-eye problems than with my Lumix (which also tended to overexpose a lot more.)In the end, this is definitely better than a lot of cameras out there, but I simply can't recommend it even if it's on sale. This purchase has really jaded me about Canon.""

"20120312","5.0","Excellent Camera","I've owned many Canon cameras and liked them all.  This one is no exception.  I have not used it much yet but so far it is very easy to use, takes great photos and seems very sturdy.""
"20120312","5.0","A great PnS at this price level.","Disclaimer:  When it comes to photography, I'm little more than a somewhat advanced novice who knows some words like 'aperture' without fully understanding how it works.  Just a regular guy who likes to play at taking pictures.This camera is simple to use and produces good images decently quickly.  Personally, I don't see much of a difference between the quality level of the major manufacturers at this price point, so I say it's a good idea to head to some place where you can put your hands on each model, see which one feels right to you, and has a user interface you prefer.The form factor is great.  It's no big deal to keep this camera on you all the time, slides in and out of pockets fairly easily since the only real protrusion is the zoom toggle, which also acts as a bezel for the shutter button, and it is nicely rounded so it does not catch easily.  The available buttons are easy to find by feel, with a small exception being the the Func. Set button, but that generally happens when you put a button in the middle of a circular pad.The interface is greatly simplified.  For the most part, you're trusting Canon's engineers to figure out and apply the proper variables to your pictures.  This is even true of the Program mode where you have more control, but many features for more fine control are locked away from the user.  For example, there are over a dozen different modes (such as 'landscape', 'fireworks', 'portrait', etc.)  installed on this camera, and  you can only manually select a fraction of them.  Generally, this is no problem as the automated systems do a good job of selecting the proper settings, but generally does not equal always.For those of you who want more control, there is a firmware extension you can get called 'CHDK' that will give you much more detailed control and does work on the Elph300HS.The video function, I can't really speak on because aside from one test video, I haven't bothered with it.  Obviously, I think it bears pointing out that if you plan on taking a decent amount of video at full 1080p, you need as large and as fast of a memory card as you can afford.  1080p video is *huge*.I'm perfectly happy with the image quality so far.  Most all of my bad pictures have been because I was playing with CHDK and did something wrong myself.  I've taken around 1,000 shots so far with this camera and have yet to come across anything that even gets me slightly annoyed at it.  It's not perfect, but no piece of technology is.  It gives good image quality, but not great image quality; however, that's a function of giving less than $200 for a camera.  For what this camera is, at the price it is, I'm satisfied.All of that said, to address some of the points frequently brought up about this camera:Textured casing--personally, I like it.  People refer to it as a sandpaper like consistency, which I guess is true if you're talking about an extremely fine grit sandpaper.Camera Breaking--I'll update my review if this happens and change the score accordingly. From reading on the internet, the issues with it physically breaking seem to happen much more with the Chinese made models than the Japanese ones.  I have a Japanese one, for whatever that's worth.""
"20120312","4.0","Great little camera","I mostly use this to document my work so I'm not taking many shots of people. I've found the flash to overpowering, it tends to whitewash the pictures so I've turned it off.You'll need to get a memory card as it doesn't come with one and a decent case to keep the lens from collecting dust and scratching the back screen.""

"20120311","2.0","Thought this was a great camera...","Gave my wife this as a Christmas gift.  She used it once, before putting it into a case.  While it was in the case, it got dented.  The lens cover that automatically closes to protect the lens would not close.  The pictures taken with the camera were great, and it was easy to use, unfortunately the camera is not sturdy enough to withstand normal use.  In fact, it isn't even stout enough to withstand gentle use.Add in the fact that for some reason this camera now costs $80 more than it did in December, and I can't recommend this camera at all.  (Our last 3 cameras have been Canon Digital ELPH's and I've loved every one, until this model.)""
"20120311","3.0","Very rough finish to touch","Features wise - this is a very nice camera but when you touch the camera - its not that good. Actually the problem comes up when you try to use it. Though people say that rough texture is good as camera will not slip out of your hand but the feel of touching this camera is not good. So I didn't like it. I returned this camera and purchased a new one Canon ELPH 310 HS. Everything else is same in 310 as well. Outer texture is also good there. Also - 310 HS has 8X optical zoom. so overall - i liked 310 HS rather than 300 HS.""
"20120311","5.0","Cannon Camera","I think this camera is the best I have had thus far.  I have purchased several Canon cameras before this last one and have enjoyed using them.  The Cannon Power shot that I purchased recently is quite easy to use, slim type makes it convenient to carry and it does take great pictures.""
"20120311","4.0","Very good but with some issues","The camera feels equal in construction to my last Canon Powershot, with an aluminum (to all appearances) body with plastic buttons and a big, nice screen. Yes, the bottom flap (over the battery casing) feels a bit cheap, but not when it's closed, only when it's open, and that's hardly ever.My main concern/issue with the camera isn't its construction, but rather in its photos. In indoor lighting conditions, especially the type of overhead poor lighting you see in offices and schools, it takes poor photos of people. How so? Well, on automatic, the color balance tends to make it appear as if everybody is wearing cake makeup. I also find the auto-white balance, when inside, to be rather too warm. In addition, on occasion the noise levels seem outrageously high (to be fair, I've also noticed the reverse, so that might just be on me.) You can overcome it by fiddling around on manual, but I just want to take decent photos of my classmates as soon as I turn my camera on. I also noticed it has a tendency to lack focus. So if you're lazy and take a lot of this type of photo, I'm not sure I'd recommend the camera. It does wonderfully in better lighting by windows and outside.The second issue I have with the photos it takes is the amount of fringing, which is more than I've ever experienced before. Granted, I've only shot with SLRs and my last two point-and-shoots, but it is significant and annoying. Still, it's hardly crippling.Otherwise, I found the camera to take very pleasing photos in decent lighting, retain very high amounts of detail in it's crisp macro shots, and be an improvement over my last Canon point-and-shoot. The images it makes are large and detailed, it does a good job of identifying faces (though it will see them where they don't exist, it finds them 90+% of the time when they are in the photo). Granted, I'm not sure how useful that is. It's good at preserving non-skintone colors, and I found that I can crop the images it takes about 50% and still have a usable photo. I never need the digital zoom, but I have played with it, and it's better than Canon's digital zoom used to be.The menus are not difficult to use, but their layout is inefficient, especially in manual mode. If you're buying a point-and-shoot to use in manual, (1) you have some introspection to do, and (2) this isn't your camera.I found it needs some urging to focus on the correct area of the photo, but what point-and-shoot doesn't? I also noticed distinctly lesser ISO noise in low lighting than in previous cameras I've owned, though more than you'd see in an SLR (of course).Overall, I'm happy I got the camera. It's inexpensive for the quality it delivers. It's lightweight, responsive and where lighting is passable, retains colors very well. It's not perfect, and its photos will never knock me off my feet, but I would have been foolish to expect a camera in this price range to be stunning. It's very good.""

But I've dropped this a couple of times already (once on a hard surface from about 5 ft) but the camera just works fine...Coming to picture quality... I took more videos than photos on this one and the video quality was great when viewed on a HDTV. It was obviously not good when zoomed or under low light. I liked the photo quality as well, especially when taken in low light. Once, we couldn't use the flash as it was misty and the flash was reflecting on the water droplets. So I just switched the flash off and the photos came out really well. My friend was using a slightly older model of a canon camera and the pics were pathetic.This is  worth the money spent and amazon sweetened it with a free 4 gb sd card and a hdmi connector!""

"20120302","5.0","Good for baby pics","We had an older digital camera that was just not keeping up with our baby. By the time it focused, the moment was over. And that's not even talking about flash photos. Indoor shots were a mess, grainy or blurry. I did some serious research and we bought this camera. WOW! What an improvement. I'm yet to take it out of AUTO mode and we've got a lot of great photos already. I'm not a huge photography buff, I just wanted a point and shoot camera that performed well indoors. Well, I got that and more. I can take better photos indoors without flash with this camera than the old one took with flash. The time it takes to focus and take a shot is very fast - fast enough to catch a super active baby before he moves on. And the color balance is pretty darn tooting good to boot. Yes, it takes a few days to figure out how to get it to focus on the right thing so you have a few blurry pics at first. Yes, you can sometimes hear a little vrrrrrr sound when you are zooming out in the movie mode (never yet zooming in, hmmm). But I didn't get the camera to take movies (though I've ended up taking a bunch and the quality is better than from our Flip video camera) and the still photos are great. Battery lasted about a week of daily intermittent use. One feature I love - you don't have to turn the camera on (get the lens to come out) in order to review your photos, so it protects the sensitive lens from grubby little hands.""
"20120302","3.0","A bit cheap-looking","My wife wanted a small, good-quality digital camera, so I did some research and bought the silver Canon 300 HS. My wife tends to put aesthetics before technical features and she didn't like the look of the camera. I have to admit, the black plastic buttons did look quite cheap-and-nasty.Also, she wanted a panoramic mode like my more expensive Sony camera. Although the description does say that there's a panoramic mode, it just means that the camera will help you take consecutive pictures that can later be combined into a panoramic mode using some PC software. The camera itself doesn't create a panoramic picture (unlike my Sony).In the end we swapped the Canon for a similar-priced Sony camera (DSC-W570) which looked much nicer and had a panoramic mode. This camera seemed to be simpler to operate too, compared to the Canon.In summary, we didn't actually use the Canon camera so I can't comment on the quality of the pictures, but this review is just to highlight a couple of things that I didn't see in other Amazon reviews.""

When you push it, it performs the same function as the Movie start button and starts recording video.  Bizzare defect.  I reset the camera to factory defaults and tried everything else I could think of.  I've checked all of the forums looking for this problem and called Canon thinking maybe I needed a firmware update.  No firmware updates have been released yet and no mention of this defect on any forums.  Looks like I got just an old fashioned defect.  First problem I've ever had with any of my Canon cameras (even going back to my old film cameras).  I need to confirm with Canon tech support (they are only available M-F) but it looks like it's going back.Update (2/28/12):  Canon Tech support had never heard of this problem.  While they would repair it under warrenty, they suggested I return it to Amazon which would actuqally be easier.  At this point I still want this model camera because the combination of features, image quality and size can't be beat for the price.

"20120222","2.0","Great Features. Useless for children or pets!","I've been through plenty of cameras over the years and have had a very good history with Canon.  However, this camera was a huge disappointment.  The reviews were great and the technical specs and features are excellent.  The one thing I never saw before the purchase was how long it takes to acquire a focal point and actually snap the shutter.If you want to take photos of kids or pets, this is NOT the camera for you!  You will miss every cute moment you planned to capture when buying a pocket camera like this.I've tried adjusting countless settings and cannot seem to speed the button-to-shutter time enough to be useful.  My spouse keeps trying the camera because its small enough to cary (compared to the Rebel) but consistently threatens to throw it through the window.On the up side, the video quality is good.  I actually dialed back the quality a bit to get more time on our card and we're still very happy with the video.  Its too bad that's all we find useful on this camera.""
"20120222","5.0","I couldnt ask for more.","My family has been big in photography for as long as i can remember. MY mom owns a Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III and between her and i using it, we have filled up almost 50gigs of just pictures on my computer. The only problem is it is big and heavy, and we need a backpack just to carry it and its lenses around. That's exactly why i wanted just a simple point and shoot that i could take anywhere with me, so i went ahead and bought this camera, and here's what it's about.This camera does EXACTLY what i want it to do and what it should do. I didn't buy this camera for the purpose of the best shots possible, at a relatively low cost, and in a small camera that I can take anywhere with me. For the purpose of my review, I'll be relating the quality of this camera to what you payed for it, not to the Quality of the EOS-1Ds Mark III. That being said, i couldn't ask for more out of this. This camera has plenty of features, takes great pictures, especially at low light, takes good quality video, and is really fun to mess around with the high speed video mode. Although the high speed may not be the best quality, and requires a good amount of light, it is fun and interesting to use. Anyways, im not going to get into the technical stuff with this camera, but i will say that it has gone beyond my expectations. I didn't really research many cameras before i bought this one, i just went to a camera store and asked them to hook me up with a decent point and shoot, and this is what i got, and man can i say I am so happy that this was the camera that they gave me.To address some issues about this camera that other people had, the black paint is textured... SLIGHTLY. Its not bad and is never irritating to touch. At least for me, i like the feel of the paint. And as for the sound in the high speed video mode, you dont need sound. When was the  last time you saw an extremely slow motion recording with the sound? and if there was sound, there's some really high tech stuff that has to go into that.And for the only con that i can find about this camera... would be battery life?? its not that bad, but iv had other cameras that last longer. And the only other bad thing about this camera is that i just dont find myself taking my EOS-1Ds Mark III anywhere because this camera is so simple, and so great.""
"20120222","5.0","Great little camera for vacation","I got this camera so that I wouldn't have to lug my Canon Powershot SX100 around.  I love the SX100 because it takes incredibly good pictures and video.  However, it is a big camera and I have to carry it in a camera bag around my shoulder.  I finally decided to get something that was small, inexpensive, and could take really good pictures and video.  The ELPH 300 was highly recommended by a camera buff who I worked with.  Another thing I really liked about the camera is that the battery lasts a long time.  I have only charged it once and have used it several times taking video and pictures.  My powershot SX100 eats the like out of the batteries rather quickly (though I do think something is awry with it and may need repairs--I dropped it once).  The Powershot ELPH 300 has a long battery life relatively speaking.I am glad that I purchased this camera.  It takes great pictures and videos.  It is small and I just stick it in my pocket.  It has simple controls too.  If you want a simple and inexpensive camera that takes very good pictures and good video then this is a sure thing.""
"20120221","5.0","Great camera!","I recently purchase this camera to replace my Canon PowerShot SD600. I received the camera a week before leaving on a Caribbean Cruise vacation. On the trip I took over 800 photos in various lighting conditions and situations. Nearly all of the photos came out clear and focused. It is capable of taking clear images out a side window of a moving vehicle, in a dark cave and even when zoomed in 20x. I am very impressed with this camera so far! It has proven to be a fantastic replacement for my previous Canon camera.""

"20120218","5.0","I'm Jealous","So small, a cigarette pack would make a good storage case for it. So solid feeling that the temptation to drive nails with it is not unreasonable.To anyone knowing which end of a camera points forward, the owner's manual is a bit of a waste. I took the camera out of its shipping box after 10PM and used it almost immediately.Using only light from the bedroom LCD TV and laptop screen, I took eight nearly perfect pictures and a short movie clip. I had intentionally turned off the camera's flash to see what I would get.Too bad this was my wife's birthday present. Maybe I can talk her into a trade for my 10 year old Minolta Dimage.Recomendations: Buy this camera with 16Gbyte of memory and a spare battery ($10) and you'll be set for almsot any occasion.Complaints: Wish the zoom could be operated manually or at least slower.

And the flash should be on the other side because you get a shadow sometimes in the bottom right hand corner because its too close to the lens, also you would think it would have came with a real owners manual but the hints and tips on the camera are a better idea anyways.

I have been pleasantly pleased with the way this camera performs in low light, though I am still sort of overwhelmed with all the options. I usually just leave it on manual, daytime. I don't like how large the screen is but I think it's just because I am so used to the size and the feel of the old camera....speaking of which, I *do* prefer the straight lines and boxiness of the older camera to the curved 'cuteness' of this new one.""

"20120212","1.0","I get the lens error too","I got the red version of the 300HS during the Xmas 2011 season, via Amazon. I was pretty happy with it, the videos and pictures were good quality in good light, although luke warm in anything but perfect light.In February 2012, my 2 year old dropped it about 2 feet onto a carpet with the lens extended. There are no scuffs or marks.  Now it no longer takes pictures, and the lens won't retract. Whenever you turn it on, it says 'Lens error, will shut down automatically, restart camera.' Then shuts down.After some google work, I found that this is a common problem with this model.  Several people suggested fixes: removing and reinserting the battery, pulling the lens in each direction while restarting,  among others. None are working for me.I will see if this is covered by warranty, however I don't have high hopes. I understand my daughter dropped it (2 feet onto a carpet), but I am not impressed with the durability, so I make this post as a warning to shoppers that the durability is poor. I am echoing a complaint that has been voiced by a number of other owners of this model.""

"20120205","5.0","Excellet camera for point-shoot amateurs","I looked for a new camera after my old canon powershot s60 conked out and so far have been extremely satisfied with the Canon ELPH 300. I am not a serious photographer and wanted a point-and-click variety that I can use on trips and is easy to carry. The camera is VERY easy to carry and VERY easy to use. The battery holds a very decent charge (we didn't have to charge it on a 3 day trip that included video and photos).  The camera seems to have a huge host of features which I haven't fully tried out yet (though the long exposure is one I tried and enjoyed). Another great feature is that it captures video with zoom which is VERY handy. Unless I am doing some serious recording, I find it  extremely useful that I can snap pictures and capture some simple video right from my camera. There are several smartphones which are fast becoming  good cameras, but I still find that digital cameras are a cut above them and would highly recommend this to point-shoot amateurs who want decent shots with minimum fuss or baggage.After taking it on 4-5 trips I will say that I am quite satisfied with the camera quality in terms of shots in reasonable light as well as its video abilities (for a point-shoot class).""
"20120204","3.0","Good but not perfect","Pros:1. Clear image2. High resolution3. Slim and simple design4. Large LCD5. Battery cover is flimsyCons:1. Distorted/elongated the left & right edges of the photo (are all digital cameras like this nowadays? cuz my old Sony digital camera don't have this problem).2. Inaccurate battery warning, no percentage, but only 3 bars (the battery was fully charged and was used very little for 2-3 days. I left it in the camera, a few more days later, it still showed 'full' at 11am, then it died at around 3-4pm. I only less than 20 photos!)3. Battery dies fast!4. No day time in the display5. Auto mode behaves inconsistently. (The flash sometimes will only work in Auto-mode, I have to use the Manual mode to make sure it works.)6. Make photos vivid one at a time in the camera only. (I wonder why there's no option to take photos vividly or comes with a software to make all photos vivid in the computer.)7. Sometimes pressing the big buttons to take pictures don't work. (When I try to take self-shots, I pressed the big button and saw the lens blink, but photo is not captured.)8. The 'review' function is slow when it's off after every photo is taken. (When I tried to make quick shots at an event, I turned off the review function, but it still makes me wait 1 second to take a second photo.)I've never own anything better than this camera. I start to see its cons as I use it, but I still love this camera.Everyone was talking about getting the camera that's made in Japan. Mine's made in Japan. Hope it lasts long.Update 2/21/2012:Ricardo is right. I found that vivid photo setting.And the distorted edges are call 'barrel distortion.' The lens is built this way and there is no way to disable it. The distortion is fine when taking landscape pictures, but it really widen & fatten people on the sides when trying to take group pictures or when trying to take self-shots. :(Photos were not deleted from the flash memory card when I tried to do it in my computer. I've to either delete them or format the card from the camera if I need more space.""
"20120204","3.0","What the specs don't say","I've owned/used many Canon's over the years both professionally and for personal use.  Canon knows what their doing. Going by the specs I don't dive too deep because I've never been unhappy with Canon.  I breeze past low-ball ratings because people can't figure it out or don't like a feature. I've found a few fundamental problems with this camera.The focus on the camera in general is great but the speed between you pressing the button and it shooting is way too long.  Low or high light.The flash takes literally 10 seconds before you can take another photo.  I understand this is a point and shoot, but thats insane.  I've used a lot of cameras and 10 seconds is way too long.  Tell a one year old to hold that pose.  Good luck.  You just missed it.The battery is weak.  I've taken great care to properly charge this battery and have cycled through it about 10x and it's gotten a bit better.  You'll need to buy a few more so you can use this camera like a normal one.  Shooting video kills it as expected but 15 minutes of 1080 will fully kill this battery.  15 Minutes.  I've played with the auto focus and the focus settings but it's still a battery killer.  I'm fully aware that video will kill these but seriously 15 minutes.  So take video out of the mix and you'll still get hopefully 50-75 photos.  Flash also throws a wrench into the battery of course so cut that number by 50%.  I have 3 batteries so this isn't a bad battery I got from Canon.It's a bad design or bad firmware because if this is how it's supposed to work this is my last Canon.  That said, when it works it looks really nice.  I'm even happy with the video.  Canon still has a chance to fix this camera with firmware and I sure hope they do.  The size is perfect but can we all agree it's thin enough?  Can we make some/any advance in battery life?  This camera went backwards.  I'd understand about the flash's refire rate or the slow focusing if the battery lasted longer.  It would make sense.  Seriously, make it thicker if you can't shoehorn a bigger battery in.""
"20120204","5.0","Canon ELPH 300HS or the Canon SX40HS? What are you using the camera for?","Someone recently asked whether they should get the SX40 for shooting pictures of the family, kids at play, and spur of the moment fun happenings. Since I have the SX40, and use it exclusively and almost always for nature photography, I don't usually like to give advice on what someone SHOULD buy. However, I also have the Canon PS Elph 300 HS and the older Canon PowerShot SD1100IS (Elph), and for parties and quick grab-and-shoot photography, I can whole-heartedly recommend the Elph 300 HS.My advice (and now I've been asked 7 times about a comparison of the two cameras):People aren't my forte. I much prefer bugs, bunnies, bees, bear, butterflies, and birds. For spur of the moment shots of family - from parties to candid shots of the kids (grandkids) - I prefer the ELPH 300 HS which also has 1080p HD Video. It's the kind of camera that you can just take with you or have in your pocket, and it's also small enough to have just lying around the house and to grab quickly.The SX40HS is also good for family activities, but I think it may be more camera than you need or would want. It weighs 24 ounces (including battery) and is just slightly less bulky than a DSLR. You can use it for high definition videos, but unlike the Elph, it's unwieldy and I suggest a tripod. I don't think a tripod is necessary for vids with the Elph: it's so light (5 ounces!), all you need is a relatively steady hand.If you are going to take videos, get an extra battery.IF you want to get into nature photography (see my noncommercial nature photo site), but don't want a DSLR, and if you're willing to go through the learning curve, then I might suggest the SX40. But we have two Elphs and for a quick grab and shoot, it's the one I'd recommend. Btw, it has a fantastic lens. The pix are sharp and all you have to learn is composition (which eludes some people).I can't make the decision for you, but from what you've described, the SX40 is just more camera than what you'll need and it might just lie around because it's too much trouble. The Elph has a lot of capability, but the great thing is that it will fit into any pocket and it will give you great pictures. And, btw, some of my landscapes and a few of my butterflies were taken with my wife's Elph. At times I actually prefer it for macros.And you'd be saving about $150.EW""
"20120201","5.0","Great Camera, Excellent Price","I received this camera as a gift for Christmas even though I picked it out myself.  I spent days looking at different cameras on the internet and reading all of the different reviews and I just kept coming back to this one.  I did go to the stores and look at them after I had it narrowed down.  Everything I read about it is pretty much dead on, its a great point and shoot.  It is small, but I think I like that about it.  I am still able to easily operate the camera and it doesn't have take up much space in my  pocket.  It is very quick in startup and in between shots.  It takes excellent pictures and video.  Don't worry about all of the different reviews you read that try and point out flaws in the pictures, the picture quality is excellent (I am displaying on a brand new 27' MAC) and I really see no issues.  It does have a lot of cool features that are kind of buried in the menu system, but I don't think I have used anything except the auto mode to this point.  Also, I was able to get it on sale on here for $120.  So, if you need a digital camera that takes great pictures and video and you aren't looking to invest in an SLR camera, I highly recommend it.""

"20120131","3.0","Powershot 300 HS","I am a huge fan of the Canon Powershot cameras and have owned and carried varying models around the world and back.That being said, this camera is smaller than any previous model I've owned and takes similar quality pictures. I find the photos from the 300HS are over-saturated and macro close-ups are very difficult to take. White balance is poor. Focus is different than my SD870IS so there's a bit of a learning curve to this 'new' processor.This is an Automatic Point and Shoot. Turn it on and take a snapshot.The settings menu is not as easy to navigate as previous Powershots and for space-saving they moved the Scenes from a dial to the menu which is a bit more effort to select night scene or pets or fireworks.. etc. There is a single switch to shift between fully AUTO and whatever you've set the scene, via the menu, to be.SUPER SLOW MOTION VIDEO is awesome!~ As are a few of the other scene options. The camera works great for the point and shoot and it's just the right size for my intended purpose. I need to have a camera with me at all times and this fits the bill.A screen protector on the LCD allows me to toss this in a bag or leave it lying in my vehicle console without worry. I'm on the fence about wether I would purchase this exact camera again, leaning toward no since I have grown accustomed to a Panasonic's impeccable focus (since my 870 died) and I definitely prefer the white balance of a Sony I have for Macro work - i.e., taking pics for eBay or product shots.Seems the 300HS is better suited for 'general' photography, like catching the sunset, taking pics of houses for work or catching your friends doing silly things. As with most of these little cameras, there is no telephoto and the 3-5x zoom doesn't do much at all.I vote middle of the road on this.. what was my favorite camera in the world and my 6th Canon Powershot.Update: I should have given this camera another star simply for the fact it can take pictures in incredibly low light without a flash. It is quite a remarkable little camera, but I still have issues with it. ...as my only camera which I carry with me and use nearly every single day.""

"20120127","5.0","Excellent Point N' Shoot! ( Elph 300HS, Black)","I really can't say very many  more positive things about this amazing camera that have not been said already. It takes amazingly vivid and detailed pictures outdoors, low light, and even no light! Test it out in a completely darkened room, and you will be shocked at the resulting image. I purchased the black model, and I have to say that the people who describe the finish as being like sandpaper are exagerating a bit. Most big box stores carry this model now, so you can finger it yourself before you buy it there or here on Amazon. I think it adds a solid grip to this camera and makes it a little more rugged looking and feeling. As of this month,Jan. 2012, The Canon Elph 110HS is now out, with all the features of this Canon Elph 300HS and more, so on paper, The Elph 110 is a better camera, as it has Digic 5 sensors and this one has Digic 4, It is 16.1 Megpxl.s and this has 12.1 and unlike it's predesesor, The Elph 100, can zoom while in 1080p video. Oh, and it's $20 dollars cheaper! Amazon has it, but you will have to directly type it into the search. Bigger LCD screen, as well. I would also point you to Youtube, as there are many video reviews of The Elph 300HS and 310HS posted there. The 310HS is essentially very simmilar to The 300HS, but has a larger LCD, and 8X's zoom and The 300HS only has 5X's zoom but utillizes it well and does pretty good a little beyond optical zoom, but this time there is a $55 dollar increase with The 310HS. As I said, The Powershot Elph110 is a better camera on paper, but it is so new, there are not any reviews on it yet, so I would still stick with The 300 HS or 310 HS or even The SX230... if a little more size isn't an issue, because it has 14X's zoom and that's finaminal. My girlfriend has The SX230HS and it takes SLR quality shots, almost. Each 1x increment in zoom is a huge improvement in flexabillity and quality. More megapixles really dosn't mean much, most times. I hope I haven't overwhelmed you guys, but just stick with The Canon HS models and you won't go wrong! Update: Purchased some cool goodies last week for this camera.

"20120127","4.0","Am very pleased","I have a Canon A620 that seemed like it might be on its way to extinction.  I really liked the pictures it took, so I decided to get another Canon camera.  At first I thought I should get another camera that took AA batteries, but as I checked price/features/weight I decided to buy the HS300 from Amazon.  I think I did well price-wise because they were on sale and came with a 4GB SD card (one of the '10' series, which I think is faster than the '4' series), and cables.  Anyway, I took the new camera with me to Italy.  It performed very well and was very light weight.  Even with many hours of walking per day the weight and size were great - I never felt tired or had trouble shoving the camera into a pocket or purse.  Compared to the heavier weight A620 I did find there was more of a tendency for the camera to move as I pressed the shutter button, so more care was required to get clear pictures.  But the balance between price/features and weight was good for me.  I'm glad I bought it.""
"20120127","5.0","Really like this little camera.","This is a sweet little camera.  The main reason I bought it was to snap photos through a microscope.  I teach BIOL 1111 and 1112 in our community technical college and wanted to show my students the actual slides they would be using.  I insert them into a PowerPoint presentation.I bought a device to attach to the scope, which will hold the Canon 300.  However, I have been really pleased in that I can hold this camera at the eyepiece and take pictures by hand.  Right now the pix are still on the SD card, but I plan to post some later.I played around with the movie mode and am really happy with the quality of the video.  It would rival my little camcorder, only the Canon 300 doesn't have a viewfinder.Anyway, it is just what I wanted.Bobby""

"20120119","1.0","Great pictures, poor craftsmanship, worse customer service","I purchased a Canon ELPH 300 HS less than a year ago. Loved the still pictures and videos it took. After three months of ownership, the front lens cover got dented because I placed this 'pocket' camera in my, you guessed it, pocket. Unfortunately the keys that cohabited this front pocket dented the flimsy lens cover. No matter, a cosmetic flaw. Three months later, however, the lens would not extend and the camera would immediately switch off (dreaded 'Lens Error'). From a variety of news postings, it seems that this is not an uncommon problem in the ELPH because sand or dirt (you know, things that might end up in small amounts in your pocket) can get into the zoom assembly and cause it to jam. I sent in the camera, paperwork, and warranty to Canon. Canon then sent an email informing me that (1) they don't fix this camera, ever and (2) because of the unrelated damage, they won't offer a replacement (they would be happy to replace it with a refurbished unit for full price!). I then called the service number and spoke with two incredibly unknowledgeable and unhelpful customer 'service' representatives who read to me from a script and who continued to refuse to honor the warranty. I cannot recommend strongly enough against buying this camera - you are buying something that is poorly made from a company that has no intention of honoring their warranty.""

It doesn't seem much to ask at all--yet, why have I been let down by digital cameras time and time again for the past six years?!Well, I am now finally glad to report that I have found a reliable camera that is consistently good for this average point and shoot user. Note the key terms 'reliable' and 'consistent'--these descriptive words have a conspicuous absence from my experiences with past cameras. So. Hallelujah! Thank you, Canon, for enabling a simpleton like myself to capture striking images of my goldfish (Woodward and Bernstein).""
"20120118","5.0","I LOVE THIS CAMERA!","I bought this one ($150 at Fred Meyer) after returning a Nikon S9100 (which was horrendously disappointing).  The gal at the counter suggested the Canon, she was preferential as that was a brand she used routinely.  She was great enough to demo the model on display, and it has amazing capabilities.  The traditional zoom is wonderful (see the pictures I've included of the living room versus the read door), and the macro zoom is impressive as well (see all the other pictures I posted).  I'm not a professional photographer, I was just looking for something to replace my older, bulky digital camera, and this thing is a joy to use.  It's slim when not in use, and takes exactly the type of pictures I want.  The video feature is nice, easy to use, though the microphone on it isn't great.  Keep that in mind; if you're planning on taking lots of video, it's heard to hear people if they're speaking in a normal voice when they're more than 4 feet away.  It isn't a problem for me, as that wasn't my primary purpose, but I can see the advantages in having it as a feature.  Might look into whether there is an exterior microphone option if we use it more in the future.  Take a look at the sample photos.  Again, I'm not a pro., and those were taken right after taking the camera out of the box, no instructions/manual used.  I highly recommend this camera- seems to be a great value.""

"20120116","2.0","Poor image quality and photos can't be dragged and dropped to PC","I got the Elph 300 HS as a gift.  I had just bought a different brand of compact P&S, but returned it after I saw all the great ratings and reviews for the Elph 300HS from professional reviewers and customers. After having the Elph 300 HS camera for a month I am really surprised that so many reviews are positive, which have fooled me and others into going with this mediocre camera.  Yes, it looks nice and is small, but the image quality is very disappointing and there is no way to directly drag and drop the photos from the camera onto your computer.Image quality - This camera is touted as being good in low light due to Canon's update to better sensor technology in this model.  Far from being better in low light, it is much worse than my previous compact point and shoot.  Indoor images are blurred when anyone in them makes even the slightest of motion during the shot.  And they are not just a little blurred; they are significantly blurred even when the lighting in the room is good.  I also have experienced an excessive yellowness to images taken without the flash indoors.  With most cameras there is usually a nice warmness to photos taken indoors without flash, but the Elph 300 HS goes way beyond a nice warmness to excessive yellowing.Downloading photos - I am surprised that I read nothing about the lack of direct download capability in all my research on this camera.  I went on a weekend trip and afterward went to download my photos to my Mac like usual with all my prior cameras.  I have always dragged and dropped the photos onto my hard drive into folders, and only import them into software programs when I want to edit them.  When I connected the camera to several different computers, none of them show the camera as an external drive.  As a result, this camera does not allow dragging and dropping; you must use a software program just to get the photos to your computer.  You have to install and use the software from Canon's CD, or use iTunes or iPhoto or similar to get the photos from the camera to a computer.  This is a hassle and a waste of time.  After then searching specifically for this problem online, I found that some others have experienced the same issue and it appears to be the camera design and not a unique problem with my camera or computer.  Why doesn't Canon allow drag and drop?  I wonder if Canon could not get the camera to be so conveniently small if it had included whatever was needed to allow drag and drop, and thus it traded a capability that ever other digital camera I've had came with in order to try to appear so attractively small to buyers.  I never imagined I wouldn't be able to just drag and drop the photos because I've never known anyone who couldn't from their digital camera.With these major flaws already apparent after only a few weeks of use, I would not recommend the Elph 300 HS.""

"20120601","4.0","As Good As It Gets","This camera is awesome, especially for the price I got it for ($110 including shipping, not from Amazon), but even for a buck-fifty, it'd be worth it.It's fantastically small; the first camera I feel OK about putting into my pocket with my phone, as long as the camera has some protection.  The thing is a camera, not a phone - it's not designed to take as much abuse - if you carry it with no covering, you do so at your own self-inflicted peril.  It's not Canon's fault so many people don't know that dropping a camera on the ground can break it.  I thought that was pretty common knowledge since the 19th century.The look and feel is awesome.  Mine is black, and I love how it feels like it's coated in fine-grit sandpaper.  It looks slick without being shiny and has a great grip compared to other point-and-shoots where you are left gripping with four fingers.  The texture is really an added bonus to this camera; they did it right.  I've had people pick it up and say it feels like it's made of 'cheap plastic,' but I think it's because of the small size and light weight, combined with the foreign feel of the camera, itself.  I've never felt a piece of electronic equipment made to feel like sandpaper before.  I love it.Being small, it still has a sizable screen, and I love the 24mm lens; I compared it, side-by-side, to my Canon SD1200IS, and the depth is really amazing.  The field of view is significantly closer to the actual viewpoint (your eyes have a serious wide-angle on them).  At the same time, the zoom gives it the capability to bring it closer, as long as you don't push it too far - pushing beyond the 5x point (it will digitally enhance up to 20x) results in pretty noisy images.  The video is fantastic, other than the Full HD; the camera just doesn't have the capability to record it smoothly enough.  720p is perfectly smooth but if you move the camera at all in 1080p, the video will be distractingly choppy.  But, in Auto mode, within the standard zoom range, in anything other than 1080p, this camera is smarter than I am.  There is almost no reason to leave Auto mode, which was not the case with my SD1200IS (I was never in Auto on that camera) - you can use this camera touching only two buttons: the shutter and the video button.  However, there is a flaw to this camera...The Program mode is an absolute nightmare.  This marks the first time I have ever had to read a user manual for a camera, in 25 years of using pocket cameras.  They really shouldn't be this hard to figure out.  If you want to do anything other than point, shoot, and adjust ISO/lighting/resolution, you'd better get ready to learn an entirely new interface.  It's like an electronic maze.  Changing shooting modes (other than the basic macro/landscape) or changing video (like the slow motion and '4 second video capture' whenever you take a picture) is truly so challenging that it took me hours to get it all right and days before I could do it without checking the manual.  And I'm a techno junkie.  So, that's a place where Canon really dropped the ball.  The included hard-copy manual is pathetic but the one on the included CD is fantastic, with a hotlinked TOC - why they couldn't make the camera as user-friendly as their manual, I do not know.Overall, you're not going to do better than this camera, for less than $200.  It's a year old and it still beats 2012 cameras that are priced at $300.  Bottom line is this: if you like taking pictures/video enough so that your smartphone makes you angry, this is the perfect camera for you, as long as you never take it out of Auto.""

The only quip I have with it is that the auto/program mode switch isn't attached very well and is loose. It hasn't fallen out yet, but it rattles inside the hole it's placed it.

You have to go into the menu a little bit and it isn't as accessible to change like on other cameras, but not a problem at all.  It takes very clear pictures and they show well on the computer.  I didn't like that you have to have a battery included with it (I liked my old camera I would just charge at my computer) but this camera does come with a port to re-charge the battery.  I got the package which included the camera + a case + a 4g memory card + an extra battery all for $170.00, the camera itself was $129.00, down from $229.00 a short while ago.  I know its been out for a year, but this camera for the price offers a great deal of power, especially for its small sleek size.  Only problem I have noticed so far is that the flash is in a bad spot and its easy to cover up with your finger when taking a picture.

It also has alot of features and effects, a few of I used, they were kind of cool but I can't say they were a game changer, your basic stuff, the zoom never let me down on capturing the things I was unable to reach.

I love that pocket camera, too. I bought this on the 4th of this month, so I've been using it everyday. I love the pictures and videos. It's so different from my old pocket camera, which I sold my old camera for extra money to buy the Elph 300. I'm super super impressed on the video quality. I will be posting videos on my production site, which is swatshow.blogspot.com. I made 3 videos with my cousins and sisters with my old pocket cam.

I've always wanted a point and shoot camera that is simple to use. Memories is the main reason why I bought this camera.

"20120111","5.0","Great buy! Notes on the 300 vs. 500","I purchased this camera a couple of months ago and have been very satisfied with the results. After previously owning the Canon PowerShot SD750 and using it consistently for 4 years, I decided to upgrade to another Canon and I have not been disappointed. The 5X optical zoom is great, and the wide angle lens has been a huge help for shooting from a closer distance and still being able to capture the scene that I want. The start-up time is very quick, which is great for capturing those spur-of-the-moment candid shots/videos you always wished you could catch.I debated between the 300 HS and the 500 HS for a while but ended up choosing the 300 for a few reasons. In terms of actual hardware differences related to camera function (as opposed to just the interface), the only advantage of the 500 HS is that it has a larger aperture, meaning it can capture more light. Besides that, the differences are that the 500 HS has a larger, higher-resolution screen and uses touch-screen technology, which lessens the number of physical buttons needed. However, I figured that the larger screen might drain the battery more quickly, and I actually prefer physical buttons since in my opinion, they are more reliable than a touch screen. In addition, the 300 HS is smaller, lighter, thinner, cheaper, and has a faster shutter speed.Perhaps the only minor complaint I would comment on is that the camera might be a little too small for my hands. However, I would say that my hands are larger than average so I would imagine that most people would not find this to be an issue. In addition, the camera comes with a strap, so if you make it a habit to put the strap around your wrist when you're shooting (which you should do regardless), you won't have any problems.""
"20120111","5.0","Better than the newer model 310HS","After extensive searching for a low-priced point and shoot, I narrowed my search down to the Canon ELPH. I've had them in the past and they're great to use. You should go check out SnapSort (.com) and do a side-by-side comparison of this camera and the newer version, the 310HS. You should stick with this camera for the price, considering the newer model is actually lacking features. Go check out what the experts have to say. You won't be disappointed!""
"20120110","1.0","overrated and overpriced","i bought it last week since it had mostly great reviews. right after i bought it for close to 200 dollars i noticed that amazon lowered the price to 140 bucks. i called but they werent much help. when u check out the reviews u really get ur hopes up u really think that ur gonna get excellent pics.  first of all the camera doesn't work unless u buy the sd card. second i took a few shots at home with the flash on shot a video and reviewed it online to see how well was my much anticipated resolution.  i quickly learned that the resolution is ok but nothing that wowed me. i zoomed the pics to see how well it retained its resolution but i noticed it became pixelated.  then i played the video to see how well it looked...i gotta say it looked ok not great...i think that this camera probably throws some excellent pics on places with lots of light or sunny environments....the pics look ok with some in the good range, but i wouldn't vote it a 5 or 4 stars like many people do so here.  i think its a great camera and would say excellent if it costs under 140 bucks....well these r my initial complaints...hope it helps...if u r new into digital cams and r looking for a decent camera i would recomm it but don't pay more than 140 bucks....if u have owned digital cameras and ur searching for something nice and with really amazing high resolution pics then i would research other cameras cuz i don't think u would be wow by this camera....good luck and god bless""

"20120110","5.0","I've had really good luck with Canon","This is my 3rd Canon (compact) camera. I've had good luck in keeping them functional for years on end. I make an effort to keep them safe from moisture, temperature extremes and hard knocks (invest in a nice case, it's a must).I don't recall ever having any functional problems - outside the protective shutter on the lens not fully opening without some encouragement. A problem that can be expected for an older camera that's been everywhere with me.What I've found that really separates these types of cameras is how intuitive and functional the many options are. Getting around the camera's menu options takes lots of practice, and I've found other brands to be very difficult to learn. I've never HAD to open the Canon user manual, with others I've been forced to. If you're not someone that has been shooting for years you really should peruse the manual and get a grasp on what your options are. If you're old enough to have shot actual film, these cameras simply blow away your imagination.This model offers a 'tilt-shift' shooting option (referred to as 'miniature') and fish-eye lens option. Both very useful and fun to make your images stand out.I always tell people the most critical component to getting a good pictures is to first, have a camera with you. If you own a large SLR with extra lenses you'll get some great pictures no doubt, but are you going to bring that camping or vacationing? Maybe, but it won't be with you all the time. This camera (with case) takes up a little more space than a smartphone. It can be with you at all times.The video is another reason I upgraded; bigger and sharper than my previous model (SD 1100). Video can capture so much that a still-shot can't.My only real complaint is that getting to the 'photo stitch' option seems to get harder and harder with every model. I should find that manual.""
"20120109","5.0","Slick little camera","Very happy with this camera. Small, capable, controls are not too complicated. Being able to shoot video has turned out to be a really fun addition to the still image capture for which we bought it.""
"20120109","1.0","yellow pictures--no thanks!","If you plan to ever take pictures in dim lighting then this is not the camera for you!  You will get a sickly bright yellow light to all your pictures and Cannon will do nothing to help you with this.  When I called them they said I could change about 62 settings to make it just right--yea, like I have time to do that when my child is doing something adorable for 2 seconds.  They did not even offer to take a look at it or exchange it for another model.  So, I am stuck with a costly mistake and will definitely never purchase another Cannon product due to their insanely unstellar assistance.""

"20120108","5.0","Great Little Camera","I recently had to replace my wife's camera.  She wanted an easy to use compact as she was shooting a lot of our great-grandchild.  After researching all the options I ordered this one even though I am a dyed-in-the-wool Nikon lover.  I have to say I am extremely impressed with its easy of use, quality of picture, very compact size and the fact that the wife has bonded with it easily and quickly.""
"20120108","4.0","I like it... but...","This is my 5th Canon Digital Elph series and wanted this model to replace my SD890IS.  I also bought the 100HS (6th Elph :-)) to replace my wife's SD1100IS.  I generally replace my point-and-shoot cameras (P/S) about every three years.Like many other reviewers have mentioned, Canon does make very good P/S cameras.  I bought these cameras for the HD (720p/30fps and 1080p/24fps) video capabilities.  There are plenty of good reviews on the video capability of this camera so I will not mention it here.I am a 'tech-y,' and researched beyond just the number of mega-pixels.  Truth be told, MP does not mean anything to me if the image captured isn't sharp or useable.  I am a super fan of the Canon Elph series for their overall quality, image quality, size, weight, battery life and the response time between pressing the button to take a photo to the time the camera's shutter is released.  (This has been the number one factor (for me) in not taking blurry pictures.)  To me, an imaged captured is worth more than not getting anything at all.I generally do not write reviews on products that I would assume would 'stand on their own.'  However, the 300 HS has me a bit perplexed, and here's my assessment:Image quality:  Less sharp than any of my previous Elphs.  This is most noticeable at the wide angle (4.3mm/24mm equiv to 35mm).  The sharpness improves as you step up the zoom but still less sharp as any of my previous Elph models.  However, the depth of color and contrast is the best of all my previous Elphs thanks to the 1/2.3' (6.17 x 4.55 mm) CMOS sensor and the DIGiC 4 processor.  The softness is very noticeable on images taken at wide angle.  The center of the image is very soft and gets progressively worse away from the center.  If you take a landscape picture, this it isn't as noticeable.  However, if you take pics of your kids three feet away, you will notice it.  These pics are useable especially for small prints (3x5) and of course online publishing on social media sites.  The sharpness improves on pics taken zoomed-in (tele), but they still are NOT as sharp as my other Elph models.  The softness can be seen viewed even at 30% zoom on a normal computer screen.  On the flip-side, the 24mm equiv is a nice feature to get those wide shots.  For a P/S, this is very wide.  The widest angle my other Elphs models were 28mm and 35mm (of course 35mm equiv).  (My Nikon dSLR only gets 26mm equiv with a 17mm lens.  Of note:  for those wanting more 'tech-y' info: the image quality in 24mm focal length is far worse than my other Elphs in terms of sharpness, chromatic aberration, pincushion, and other distortions.  However, 300 HS favors f/2.7 (95%+ of 1500 pics taken thus far both indoor and out) which would certainly explain CA and sharpness!)(Sorry for a long review, I didn't intend it to be so long but I know someone hopefully at Canon will read this?)Picture taking modes: First of all, this isn't a dSLR.  It isn't meant to be.  That said, it does not take as sharp focused pics compared to older Elphs.  I use the 'Children & Pets' mode and the fastest the shutter will take is 1/60th of a second.  Really?  However, the fastest the shutter will go is 1/2000 of a second!  I think this is a programming issue that Canon can easily fix.  The shutter speed for Children & Pets should be higher like 1/80 to about 1/250.  Certainly 1/60 is insufficient for kids.  1/20 to 1/60 is a great range for indoor non-moving subjects.  The rest of the modes are adequate, scenery and hand held night shots are very nice, although don't expect sharp focused pictures.  Later, I will post on Flickr some of these samples with the modes and all the meta-data (i.e. shutter, ISO, and aperture info).The CMOS sensor (the 'HS' name on the model) allows the camera to use super high ISO ('film' sensitivity to light) speeds without the pics being grainy or 'noisy.'  This means you can take fairly decent indoor shots with or without the use of a flash.  I noticed 'jump' in the image quality immediately compared to my other older Elph models.  Yes, this is a nice indoor scenery camera.  The 300 HS does very well at controlling noise at high ISO levels.Tech-y note: Overall the 300 HS favors open aperture, higher ISO, and then shutter in compensation in that order.  While this is super for portraits, this does very little for taking pics of children and pets, or any moving subjects.Bottom line: This 300 HS will get the image for remembrance sakes.  It'll get the 'job' done.Recommendations?  If you can, wait for v2 of this model.  As for recommendations on competitive products?  I do like Nikon; however, none of their P/S (in this model's category, i.e. price, features, and etc...) compares.""
"20120107","4.0","Great TINY point & shoot, not quite as crisp of pictures as my old powershot, though","I thought this would take 'as good' or better pictures than the powershot I had to replace when I broke it (an 800is from about 3 years ago), but unfortunately it's not quite as crisp, especially during movement.  THAT being said, it still takes better quality pictures than my friends/family point & shoot cameras, when we compare.I love all the functions available on this camera.  Lots of options for taking continuous pics, color tinted pics, b&w, sepia, borders, fadeouts, and lots of pre-set settings (for aquariums, fireworks, nighttime, etc.).  I'm not ready to jump into the world of fancy cameras & setting my own everything, so I enjoy having those available to me when the auto setting isn't quite cutting it.I also love how easy it is to start shooting video.  Instead of having to switch a dial & wait & then hit my shutter button to start, there's simply a single 'play' button on the camera to hit & it starts recording a precious moment RIGHT THAT MOMENT.  It's wonderful.""

"20120104","4.0","Good little camera, lots of features","I received this camera as a Christmas gift and really enjoy the range of features it has. I don't expect anything near perfect from a compact camera (that's what my dSLR and arsenal of lenses is for), but this camera takes pretty good pictures and is quite fun to play with. I find the menu to be fairly intuitive (I never even opened the instruction book). I received the red version of the camera, which I wasn't crazy about at first, but guess what I haven't misplaced  yet! It is also very light and compact, which offers a bit of a catch-22: it's easy to carry around anywhere, but I'm constantly afraid I'm going to drop it if I don't have the wrist strap on simply because there's no curve or girth to hold on to.The only two things that drive me somewhat nuts about this camera:1) The flash is located right above the lens, which creates a shadow in almost any picture you take up-close while using the flash. Also, as a lefty I normally have my left index finger on top of the camera to steady it; however, the flash is so close to the top of the camera that my finger sometimes cuts off part of the flash - and I have tiny fingers!2) There's no view-finder (although I've found this to be a problem with most recently made compacts). Personally, I don't always like holding my camera more than a foot away from my face and looking at an lcd screen. Sometime's it's nice to put my eye up to a camera to take a picture. Plus, this means I can't turn off the lcd screen to conserve battery life.Overall, I am satisfied with this camera and do recommend it for the average to moderately advanced camera user.""

"20111231","4.0","surprisingly powerful in macro photo","Owning a DSLR with multiple lenses I wanted a point and shoot for trade shows  and other occasions where a DSLR is too cumbersome.  Yet I did not want to compromise on photo quality, especially on close ups ( I work in the textile business ) where I needed good macro quality.I really thought the Canon S100 would foot the bill.  After all it cost three times the price of the Elph 300 at the time.  two hundred pictures later I had to accept the fact that the elph 300 was better than his expensive brother in almost all compartments of the field, except maybe lowlight - and in wide angle at that- and shooting RAW, which, in all fairness is waste of time most of the time as the JPG engine in the Canon does incredibly well.The real shocker was the comparison of the macro performance to my DSLR.  The Elph was clearly better than my kit lens.  So I borrowed a 105mm Macro lens designed specifically for the purpose.  AFter playing with exposure, depth of field, tripods and the like, we gave up... the ELPH was better even handheld than all this expensive hardware... live and learn.my only downgrade was for the battery problem mentioned by other reviewers.  Otherwise, this machine is perfect for its purpose.  And I tried many other ELPH like the 310 or the 400 and so on, but could not justify the price difference.  This is a great value and a great little companion""
"20111230","5.0","Best Camera, Rivals and Eats DSLRs for Breakfast","First off, let me be the first to tell you that I was a sceptic of this camera. I did not think at first that it would be as good as it really is. I do not write reviews, EVER, so this is a very compelling product that you should buy because it brought me to write one :).I bought this camera two days ago, and got to 'break it in' that very night when I got it. My sister in law had her baby, and boy did it ever perform. I was taking pictures in a very low lit room. It was medium sized with only one lamp on. (REMEMBER, you are not supposed to use flash with newborns, so I did not, and this served as a real world test for this camera. I feel that the only way to see how powerful a camera really is, is to see what it can do without a flash) I was scared to look at the pictures when i got home, because, after all this is one of the worlds smallest cameras, and a point and shoot at that. I plugged in my memory card into my computer and what I saw still shocks me. The pictures taken in a dark room,without a flash, were clear, and were even brighter than the real life room itself, and no noticable noise showed. Beings I used no flash, this is stunning. There was minimal to NO noise at all in the pictures! This camera is treading on the grounds of both of my sisters DSLRs and taking it by storm.I saw one revewer saying that the build quality of these were bad. That is the biggest load I have ever heard. This camera is rock solid, and feels quite literally like a very solid block of iron, it seriously feels that rigid. Absolutely no sense of plastic-ness feel here. It even has a rough (that isnt quite the right word, it is textured) but in any case makes you feel like you will never drop it. All in all it just adds to the feel and performance of this device that, if i had the money, would pay double price for.As for the flash, it is very bright. dont let the small flash lens fool you, this sucker packs a punch. I took a pic of a dark room with flash, and it illuminated the whole room in the picture to appear like it had full lighting on. this was not a small room either.It has absolutely stunning 1080, plus you have the ability to zoom in while taking video. That in and of itself is one selling point for this camera. Only select few allow you to do 1080, that is all on top of the zoom while taking video which isnt in 97 percent other point and shoots. lots dont even give you 1080 either. Colors were ABSOLUTELY awesome.Need i mention the CMOS sensor? that is what is allowing me to take the great low light photos. Paired with canon's software, these low light photos are grain free (with very very minor exceptions, only noticable when pictures are blown up HUGE!)As you can see, i could go on, and on, all night about this, but you will never experience it until you get one. Go and buy one. Trust me, you will not be dissapointed. Please disregaurd these people that are badmouthing it! Many people hate canon because they are simply being biased and want a different camera company to be better. Reguardless of what they say, i can tell you that if you can stand still at all, even remotely, for just one second, you can a great photo, even without flash in dark situations. with flash, I could quite literally be dancing around, and get a good pic. Enough said.""
"20111230","5.0","Great camera","I purchased the Canon Powershot ELPH 300 HS about 2 weeks ago and have been using it nonstop. I've been using it all the time, and still have not had to recharge the battery. So the battery life seems pretty great to me. Also I like the fact that there is a tab type thing where the battery goes, so when you open the cover, the battery will not fall out. Which is pretty ingenious considering breaking the battery would be a big deal, since it has its own special battery. Not AA's or anything standard like that. I got the black color, since it was on sale at the time, and it has a kind of texture on the back of the camera, so holding onto it isn't a problem at all.Bottom Line: I would recommend this camera to anyone who likes to take pictures of family and friends. It does great in low-light. And the pictures come out AMAZINGLY clear. The 12 megapixel isn't as many as some cameras, but I think it is plenty for this camera. It seems to be able to take in enough light to make the pictures clear, without needing the extra 2-4 megapixels (I hate flash with a passion and use it only when i absolutely have to).""

You'd be crazy to pass it up!It feels great to have so much functionality in something smaller than my smartphone, which regardless of what some people say will not be replacing the point and shoot camera anytime soon.""

Haven't had time, which is necessary, to master the menu, but have already taken many great stills and video all in automatic. Color, focus,sound and depth are great. Love the fact that video zooms in and out even in auto play, and that the camera has multiple face recognition.

"20111230","5.0","Great camera","This is a very functional, very compact camera that is well built. It was a gift for my wife who had an older EL:PH that she gave to our daughter. This one has the benefit of more pixels, full HD, and annotated menus -- the last one is a nice feature. This camera also has a slightly rough surface compared to the smooth finish of the last ELPH, which makes it easier to hold (less likely to slip). I also got an excellent Cyber Monday price on it.""

"20111229","5.0","Absolutely the BEST. Will never buy anything but Elph again.","I have always had the Canon Elph series of point and shoot cameras since it was on the strange APS film Format.  Must have gone through 5 different Elph formats.  They have ALWAYS been excellent - easy to use - compact - great quality cameras.  I will NEVER switch brands again.  This 300HS is absolutely the best.  Just buy it and enjoy with NO regrets or worries.However, Last year I veered off course and bought a Nikon s8100 Camera with 10x Optical zoom lens.  BIG MISTAKE.  Do not get me wrong, the photos and video were good from the Nikon, but the interface and usability was AWFUL.  I just could not get used to the camera and my wife absolutely HATED it.  I read through the Nikon manual over 6 times and I still can not get the hang of the camera (I consider my self a Techie and very savvy with mechanical or electronic things.)  Also the Flash on the Nikon was just too much so all the photos were almost always washed out.  This Nikon was twice the price and takes lower quality photos compared to this 300hs Elph.Just had to switch.  So I just purchased this Canon Elph 300HS and took 60 photos and 10 mini videos today.  WOW. What a MARVELOUS improvement.  I did not even read the manual and just used the camera.  All the buttons and controls are laid out nicely and easy to use and intuitive.  I especially love the small switch from auto to manual in the top right corner.  Absolute genius whoever thought of this = no more silly dials or obscure minuscule figures to figure out.The photos came out perfectly balanced both indoors and especially outside.  What is especially GREAT is that the lower light photos used to come out 'grainy' with this HS sensor = WONDERFUL detail with MINIMAL to NO graininess.Videos in .MOV formal are sharper and clearer than my 3 year old HD video camera.  The only slight negative comment is that the microphone is very sensitive and picks up wind rubbing noises easily.  Very small compact and easy to pocket camera.  100x better than my iPhone 4s for both photos and video. GIven how portable this camera is, I am going to carry it around everywhere from now on.Just go for it.  You can NOT beat the price for quality and functions for this camera.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!""

"20111229","4.0","Canon camera is easy to use.","While browsing in stores trying to select the perfect camera for myself, a professional photographer was also looking for a camera for herself.  She explained she just wanted a camera for everyday use and not one that would require her to change lenses for different pictures.  I told her I wanted a good camera with quality pictures, but needed a 'camera for dummies', since I have difficuties figuring things out!  She said this camera was one of the best I could buy--easy to use and great pictures.  Then another person said order it from Amazon and get it at a more reasonable price.  I did, and I am most satisified.""
"20111229","2.0","Expectations fell short","I had high expectations for this camera. There was a high volume of overwhelmingly positive reviews, and my previous camera was a 6-year-old Canon Powershot A620. Any new camera would be an improvement, right? While the low-light photos definitely came out better than with my A620 (not great, but better), I felt that, on a whole, my old camera took photos that were much more clear and crisp. While I loved that the ELPH 300's size and weight made it easy for me to tote around, and I found the camera itself easy to use and navigate, I was very disappointed in the quality of the photos. I tested the camera out in multiple environments and on multiple settings, but around 90% of the photos were unsatisfactory. The photos looked great on the screen, but as soon as I uploaded them to the computer I saw that none of them were actually crisp. To be fair, many of my photos were taken in low-light settings and without flash which already makes for less crisp photos. However, for a camera that boasted being able to take better photos in low-light settings, I don't feel like it delivered. I did play around with many of the settings: changing the iso, utilizing the tungsten or fluorescent light setting, etc. and while on the camera screen the photos appeared great, again, as soon as I uploaded the photos to the computer I saw that I was mislead. FYI, my camera/card was set to the largest size and highest quality photos so that wasn't the issue.I am unsure as to why I couldn't get more than a few good (not great) photos with this camera, since there are so many positive reviews (not to mention great photos uploaded by users) for this camera. I might have received a lemon, or it might be error on my part; but seeing as how I have already spent a great deal of time and effort trying to get the best out of this camera (which is supposed to already take good photos without ANY effort), I think there is a problem here.I originally intended to purchase the ELPH 100, but opted for the 300 instead because so many more people had [positively] reviewed it, and because even though I was paying more, I was saving more off of the original price. However, $150 for a camera that I do not love is more than I am willing to pay. While I would love to only pay $100 for a camera, it doesn't seem like there is a great option in that price range (if the ELPH 300 failed me, I am assuming the ELPH 100 will as well). I would rather pay more for a camera I love. After almost 4 weeks of trying to work with this camera, I have decided to return it. I have since ordered the Canon Powershot sx230 (as high as I'm willing to pay for a point-and-shoot at this time, otherwise I would have gone for the Canon Powershot sd90 which seems like a safe bet) and after only a few hours of toying around with it, I am already much more impressed. Even with the 14x zoom (which is a definite perk), the photos have been coming out more crisp than the ones I took with the ELPH 300. I find it most helpful to read reviews for comparable items left by the same person, so once I decide for sure whether or not I am happy with the sx230, I will leave a review for it, as well as modify my review here.*update 1/5/12I still have only had the Canon sx230 for a few weeks, but I will absolutely not be returning it!! It has lived up to, and exceeded my expectations. I see that the most recent reviews for the elph300 are positive so I'm not sure where the disconnect is between their experiences and mine. If you bought the elph300 and are happy with it, great; but if not, I highly recommend the sx230!""

"20111227","5.0","Good All Purpose Camera","I have a Canon SX20is and it has been a very good camera for macro pictures of wildflowers, family and birds.  Of course, it has been very slow for birds--no pictures of small, fast-moving birds.  The main problem with it has been the bulk and size.I bought this little Canon Powershot Elf 300 HS to have a camera that I could always have with me. It has been a delight to use and enjoy.  I can always have it in my jeans pocket.  I put it in a little pouch to give it extra protection inside my pocket.  During Christmas week, my wife and I went to dinner with a couple who are friends.  I took a picture of the couple at the table and then the waiter took a picture of all four of us.  The camera is so simple, automatic and easy to use, it required no instructions to the waiter about how to use the camera.  My picture and his picture were both excellent.  The Christmas lights shinning through the glass behind the table was beautiful background.  The little flash did a great job of giving even lighting to each person.  The skin tones and colors were beautiful.The macro shots of wildflowers are excellent with very appealing colors.  And macros are extremely easy to take.I have been using the little camera to take digiscope pictures of birds.  I take the pictures through a Nikon Fieldscope 82MM.  I zoom the little camera to nearly full zoom and place the camera lens in line with the eyepiece of the scope.  It is easy and takes great pictures.  The image is a little soft compared to an expensive DSLR with long telephoto lens.  But, the softness gives the picture a romantic look.I took digiscope pictures this week of Great Blue Herons and Snowy white Egrets.  Both of these birds are photogenic--the pictures captured their beauty and elegance.I try to remember to put my little camera in my pocket each time I leave the house.  I never know when I might see a picture of something worth remembering.""

"20111226","3.0","Elph 300 review","I've had this camera 4 months. Was wanting a small, light camera for hiking and backpacking. Needed to take HD video. After reading tons of reviews, I bought this camera because it is one of those rare ones that allow you to use the zoom while shooting video, continuously focuses, adjusts for changing light and has Image stabilization. I'm happy with the video. The audio, wind noise is typical of every camera that uses the mic type that these do. I'm in the process of making a dead rat to encompass the whole camera, as even handling the body of the camera introduces unwanted noise.The pictures tho are very disappointing. You'd think for any camera approaching 10mp the pictures would be sharp and crisp with some nice detail. No so with this camera. It seems to have a lot of useless effects, but lacks important options like a sharpness setting. If you're taking landscape type pictures with this camera, expect soft, bland, detail-less pictures, especially of trees, foliage, bushes, grass, rocks. Detail and color are blotchy. I quit using it on Auto and use the Program setting all the time now to try to salvage what I can out of it.My Canon A620 7mp takes better pictures.""

I'd owned it for roughly 3 weeks and taken great care of it.I had the operating manual with me, and nothing I did could bring the darned thing back to life.So no pix of the Panama Canal. Sad day.Rather than spend the rest of our vacation cameraless, I bought a Canon Elph 100 in Panama City, Panama -- on sale, yet $75 more than it sells for in the States. (The 300 wasn't available there.)But here's the crazy thing.I compared the images taken by the 300 and those taken by the 100. The 100 shots definitely are better.

"20111225","5.0","Pure Awesomeness","I have a great super zoom bridge camera and sometimes I just don't want to carry it around with me because of the bulk factor.  So, I was shopping around for something I can stick into my pocket, but I also wanted performance.  I bought this at a higher price than what it is now, and all I can say is that it does not disappoint!  I took it to San Francisco while visiting my mom in the bay area, and took fantastic pictures outdoors and indoors with the upgraded CMOS sensor.  I don't think I'll be going back to CCD because of the pure speed CMOS offers.  Digic 4 produces the colors very well!  24mm wide angle helps a great deal in certain situations because there was one huge church and if I didn't have that I wouldn't have gotten all of it!  It records great video on a touch of the dedicated button, just make sure your SDHC card is fast enough.  Go for the silver or red one because the black one has a rough texture on it and it can scuff, while the others have smooth metallic finishes which make the camera look and feel better.  For me, the only con if you can call it that is the LCD screen resolution.  My bridge camera has 921K, and I would have liked at least 461k.  But, I wouldn't take a star away for that since everybody looks at their pictures on the computer anyway.""

"20111223","5.0","Before you buy 310 HS, read this ...","Best bang for the buck when it comes to portable P&S. I originally wanted Canon S95 and then S100 since they have bigger sensors for small cameras (bigger sensor is usually better with less noise) but I couldn't justify their cost for my needs.Canon 310 HS is an update of 300 HS but in my opinion, it is not better.  Wide angle starts at 24mm for 300 HS, whereas, it's 28mm for 310 HS/510 HS. They have longer reach but when it comes to small cameras in close quarters, wider lens is more useful - Save $50 over 310 HS. Otherwise, it has same excellent Digic 4 processor and fabulous 1080 HD video and same excellent CMOS sensor that does better in low light.The camera is fast, responsive, focuses quickly and very portable.  People with big hands may not like this model since it is tiny.  You can zoom while shooting video, which is a plus. Pictures are fine compared to other small sensored P&S cameras. People who wants to shoot RAW and manual controls should look elsewhere.  For everyone else, I consider this model to be one of the best P&S currently available in the market, taking into consideration cost, capability and build quality. I've looked at Canon S95, S100, 310 HS, 510 HS, SX230 HS, Nikon S9100, S8200, Olympus XZ-1 and chose this one.The black model has a 'rough' finish that helps to grip it better but some might be turned off by the texture.

"20111222","4.0","Pleasantly surprised.","I purchased this camera for work so top specs were not a major consideration but it needed to be decent. However after using for a little while and looking at the pictures on screen at 100%, I must say that this is a surprisingly good camera. The camera is very small and portable and the fantastic rough texture of the black paint makes it very easy to hold on to.  The camera is also made out of metal and is very sturdy. There is no noticeable flex or deflection on any surface even if pressed or gripped strongly.  The lens barrel and surround also appear to be metal and look like top quality parts.  Overall I was really surprised at how 'quality' the camera appeared and felt in terms of construction at this price point. Especially when you compare it to comparable PS cameras in the same price range that are made mostly out of plastic.The menu system is easy to use but it does have the new 'rolling' menu interface. I prefer the old Canon menu style but this one is easy to get used to after a while. I use the camera mainly on Program and not on Auto. The auto function seems fine but it is constantly 'searching' for the right setting and updating its choices on screen. I found it to be 'busy' and slow down the camera.  I will only use it on Program mode.  It has a lot of the usual Canon camera settings including the popular 'miniature setting'.  Picture quality, considering the size of the sensor, is also surprisingly good. I compared pictures from this camera to the same pictures taken by a Panasonic LX5, which has a larger sensor and brighter lens, and unless you are pixel peeping and looking at things very critically, the pictures taken by this Canon can hold their own.  Sure the Canon has to go to higher ISO settings due to its slower lens (not F2.0) and the pictures are not as tack sharp and color saturated as the Panasonic but noise is extremely well controlled for a camera in this price range. Color noise was particularly well controlled and, although some may disagree with me, at times better controlled than the LX5. Also color is typical Canon, in its rendering, which in some cases was better than the Panasonic.So if you consider that this camera is now around $150 and less than half the cost of the LX5 (remember the LX5 was originally close to $500 at one point) and a heck of a lot more portable, it is a very good performer and in my opinion one of the best camera values I have seen. Other reviewers have opined that unless you need the manual controls of the Canon S95 that this Elph would be all that one would need.  I do not have the S95 so I can't back that statement up personally but based on what I have seen so far I can see why they would say that.  The flash is small and typical of an ultra compact so I would not expect it to be a top performer but the camera does well without a flash so it's not that big of a problem. I have not used it for video and will probably not often so this is not a consideration for me.""
"20111221","1.0","disappointing image quality","I got this camera as a replacement for a Canon A75 Powershot thatis more than 5 years old but still takes sharp, well-exposedpictures.  The only feature I really wish my A75 had is opticalimage stabilization.  Unfortunately, while this camera has lotsof features the image quality leaves a lot to be desired.  Thepictures look washed-out and lack detail.The main reason for the poor image quality is the small (1/2.7')image sensor.  This size sensor is used in almost all compactcameras and they simply can't produce good quality images at lowlight levels.Note that although the 12 Megapixel 300HS has 4 times a manypixels as my previous 3 MP camera, the sensor is the same sizeand so each pixels gets 4 times less light.  This makes for morenoisy images.  The camera processes the image to try to hide thenoise but a side-effect is that the picture gets fuzzer.I tried to filter out the luminance noise in a raw image savedusing the CHDK firmware.  The result had less noise but also lostdetail. The result was arguably no better than the camera's JPEGoutput.  My conclusion is that, not surprisingly, the cameraalready does the best possible job at removing image noise.There may be specific situations where you could do a better jobmanually, it would quickly get tedious if you tried to do it forevery photo.You can find many examples of photos taken with this camera usingflickr.com's 'Camera Finder' feature.  The image noise is clearlyvisible in full-size (3000x4000) images shot at high ISO.  Butmost of these pictures look just fine when reduced to fit thescreen which is why most reviewers are happy with the imagequality.Going to a 1/1.7' sensor as used in the better compact cameras(S95 or LX5) would help a bit (about 1 f-stop), and so would awider lens (another f-stop for an f2 lens).  But more improvementwould require a larger sensor.  Unfortunately, a larger sensoralso means a larger lens.  Interchangeable-lens cameras areeither too large to fit in a pocket or their lenses leave outimportant features such as zoom and image stabilization.I spent some time trying to get the best image quality. Here'ssome guidelines I found useful:- White Balance: set the white balance manually or use the nifty  custom white balance feature.  The AWB setting often fails;  perhaps it gets confused if it can't find something in the  picture to calibrate itself with.- Saturation & Contrast: set custom color to 'Positive Film' or  use a custom color setting with increased RGB levels and  contrast - the default modes are under-saturated and have too  little contrast- ISO:  for stationary objects: set a fixed ISO that is as low as  possible while keeping an the shutter speed at 1/8s or faster.  This assumes you can hold the camera steady enough for the  image stabilization to do its job.  The automatic ISO settings  are too aggressive and set needlessly high ISO values.  Once  the ISO climbs above about 400 it's probably worth using the  'Handheld Night Scene' which reduces noise significantly by  automatically taking four shots and combining them.  for people and other things that move: set the ISO to Auto.  The camera may choose very high ISOs and produce noisy images  but at least you'll get your picture.Note that the sample photos for the ELPH 300HS on Canon's website use manual white balance and ISO 50 (which is strange sinceISO 100 is the lowest manual setting).There is an alpha version of CHDK available for this camera andperhaps the HDR and raw modes could, with post-processing, beused to compensate somewhat for the limitations of this camera.I had also expected the smaller size of the 300 HS to be anadvantage but, actually, it's too small!  The smaller size makesit harder to handle and operate the controls and yet doesn't makeit any more likely that I'll bring it along with me.The camera does take excellent HD videos and has lots ofinteresting modes if you're into tinkering.  But in the areawhere it matters most -- image quality -- this camera is astinker.I returned the camera and am looking at other compact cameraoptions.""
"20111221","5.0","Simply amazing!","I have previously owned two Kodak point-and-shoot cameras (one purchased in 2003, and one in 2006), and was a bit hesitant to purchase a non-Kodak camera, but I am so pleased that I chose this camera. I only heard about this camera because my cousin has it, and she was raving about it and I had the chance to play around with her's before purchasing one for myself. This camera takes amazing pictures. I also love playing around with the settings in the programmable mode. I have used 'stitch assist' to take panoramic pictures that look professionally done once I use the 'PhotoStitch' program that comes with the camera. One of the biggest upgrades from my previous Kodak cameras is how fast this camera takes pictures; pressing the shutter to the time this camera takes the picture is so quick, which makes it easy to not miss a shot of action.I decided to purchase the black one since I like the rough surface that makes it easier to grip. This is the smallest camera I have owned, and it takes some experience to get used to holding it.I am a college student who loves taking pictures of both people and still-life, and I love this camera!""
"20111221","4.0","Love it","I love everything about it except the battery life is not as long as my Elph 1000.  But I think the smaller size, wide angle, and more zoom make this a huge improvement from my old one.  I think it's also easier to use, even though there are a ton of new features.  All features seemed to be more accessible for quick switching of settings while I was using it.  As for battery life, it's not bad. I used the camera for two days and took a couple hundred pictures with it before the battery died.  It seems that videos drain the battery the quickest.  If it weren't for using so much for video I probably could have gotten a hundred more pictures.""

So after owning dozens of cameras since the 1970s ranging from Minolta SLR film, then a few dSLR models, Bridge and a myriad of pocket cameras...I have enjoyed the Canon brand best.

"20120515","5.0","(4.5 stars) A very good point-and-shoot camera, available at a good price","THE QUICK TAKE:  The Canon ELPH 300 is a very good point-and-shoot camera.  The size makes it easy to carry, which means you're more likely to have it when you need it.  The 5x, almost-wide-angle optical lens provides flexibility while maintaining quality.  And while small cameras like this involve a number of compromises, Canon has made the right compromises.CARRY A REAL CAMERA:  Some people would argue that the camera on their phone means they don't need a point and shoot camera.  Ummmmm .... sort of.  It is great to always have a 'camera' with you, so a phone does let you catch some photos you might miss.  But if you know you're traveling or going to an event - give yourself a chance to get some good pictures, carry a real camera (such as this one).  The photo quality is so much better than any phone, and it provides much more flexibility - to zoom, use flash, etc.THIS IS A VERY GOOD SMALL CAMERA:  The Canon ELPH 300 is a very small camera, about as small as a camera needs to be.  It's reasonably quick (except when you're taking a series of flash photos - but it's not unusual to need some time for the flash to recharge).  The photos generally have good exposure, focus and color balance.  The Auto selections are generally well made, though it doesn't seem to pick up on backlit subjects and force the flash on or otherwise adjust.  The flash works well enough for something this size.  HDMI output is nice to have.THE USUAL COMPROMISES, WELL BALANCED:  Small cameras have small lenses and small sensors.  Small lenses and small sensors capture less light, so perform best in bright light.  The processing and shooting modes help somewhat to address that.  (If you learn to use the Scene shooting modes in Program mode, that should help as well.)  Small lenses also don't have the sharpness of large lenses.  The extra megapixels of this sensor help a little with the sharpness - you're probably not printing 16x20 photos from these.  Overall, Canon has done a good job of balancing the inevitable compromises that come with a point and shoot camera.THINK ABOUT THE VIDEO SIZE:  While it's really cool to shoot 1080-line video, I'm not sure what I'd be able to do with that.  To reduce the file size and processing complexity, I've mostly been shooting 720-line.  That's still better than DVD-quality (480-line).By the way, the microphones seem to work well given the limitations of this type of camera.SOME ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT:  There are a couple areas that Canon could improve:- The biggest problem, and it is significant, is that sometimes highlights are washed out or lost altogether.  The dynamic range of the camera seems surprisingly limited.  So the face of a child laying in dark grass will lose a lot of detail.  So I'll be taking a more capable camera some of the time, to get better picture quality.- Mostly an annoyance, but an unnecessary one - you can choose to set the Review feature (how long a photo stays on the screen) for 2, 3, 4, etc seconds.  All are too long in real life shooting situations with any action.  How about half a second, or one second?- It seems you can't force the flash to fire, or force the camera into Macro mode (for close ups), unless you switch to Program mode.  That's an unnecessary extra step for very commonly used features.As far as the other reviewers disappointed by this camera, I can only think of three reasons:(1) They paid full list price.  It wasn't worth that, but at current prices (not much more than half that, look for a deal), it's a very good value.(2) They got a defective camera.  It does happen.(3) They're just not realistic about what to expect from a small camera.This is a very good, and in some ways remarkable camera, given what's possible with current technology.""
"20120515","5.0","LOOOOOVE IT!","I had an older canon powershot. It was heavy, big, and it was slow, the video was poor quality. So upgraded to this and I love it!

"20120514","4.0","Great camera for a casual camera user","I have owned two Canon digital cameras in the past, and they've both been good to me.  When I was using them in my college years, let's just say those late nights were not always easy on my cameras, but they both lasted and were quite durable.  This time around, however, when I decided to purchase a camera, I was looking for better image quality.  I'm now taking pictures of my best friends getting married and nieces and nephews as opposed to random nights in random places.  Admittedly, I don't have a particular knack for photography, but I have several friends who do, and seeing their photos made me want a camera that could capture quality images without my needing to be an expert, without me having to lug around a huge camera, and without it costing me an arm and a leg.  This one fit the bill.  I've had the camera for over six months now.  It seems to have the same Canon durability that I've grown accustomed to (I've dropped it onto concrete a time or two now).  The image quality in daylight and well-lit areas is wonderful.  I get compliments all the time on photos taken on sunny days.  In low light, this camera does better than any other camera I've owned before.  That's not to say the low light pictures are perfectly sharp, but they're much better than average.  I appreciate the size, quality of the images, and durability of this camera and it's a great option at this price point for a casual non-photographer.""

"20111218","5.0","Just what I wanted","I considered many cameras before settling on the Canon 300.  I wanted a pocket camera for everyday use but with good quality.  I have had Canons in the past and felt comfortable buying another.  One thing I find annoying is the ever-expanding megapixels in small cameras. Sucks up room on the computer, makes them harder to upload or email. Just not necessary for snapshots. My last camera was a 6 and did the job just fine.  It is several years old and showing some loss of quality, so I wanted to upgrade a little.  I use my camera for general grandma snapshots, simple scenic photos and at work to record visitors for Facebook.  I am really happy with the results.  Work is particularly challenging because the lighting is very bad.  Photos were excellent if I turned off the auto flash.  The size and weight are perfect for me.  Easy to put in my pocket when taking the dog to the beach,etc.  Or can keep handy on my desk.  I found it very slippery at first, dropped it right out of the box (on carpet, luckily)so now I am careful to use the wrist strap.  Haven't had a chance to test it on grandchildren yet, but Christmas is coming!Can't say anything about the video.  Haven't used it and am unlikely to use it much.  Clearly, not a pro - but this is a great camera for the typical snapshot taker.  I set it on auto and rarely change.  Easy to use with great quality.  Highly recommended to grandmas everywhere.P.S. It was a struggle to get all four grandchildren to look adorable at the same time.  Must be the darn camera!  :-)""

"20111217","2.0","Canon shame on you - disappointed 300HS owner","To start with, I am Canadian from Quebec and I didn't buy this camera on Amazon.com site. I appreciate Amazon's principles to let people express their opinion about products and I always use this site as a reference before buying anything - thank you Amazon for this.I bought camera online based on positive reviews (note: I had several Canon ELPHs in the past and Canon DSLR, I like photography and I understand it). I still use Canon SD880 and SD1100, older ELPHs with CCD sensor. This camera is exactly what I wanted, small, wide 24mm angle, 5x optical zoom and HD movie. Camera size is very important to me and my DSLR is always home..When I received camera I really liked it, kudos to Canon engineering team! This is beautiful P&S camera with nice spec.I was disappointed with a first picture taken in Auto mode and I immediately spotted that camera was selecting very high ISO (note, this cam is having small CMOS sensor so high ISO means digital noise, soft/blurry images - possible to print 4x6 pictures but that's it and I guess majority of people are doing exactly this). I am not 'pixel peeper' but images are not sharp at all. High ISO for this camera is 640 and above (400 is acceptable), and this cam goes easily to ISO 1000 and over which is horrible  (still possible to make small 4x6 print but images are soft, full of noise, missing detail etc --> very bad).I selected Program mode and lowered ISO to min which is 100. Pictures were dark even I had enough light and using flash didn't help. Increasing ISO to 400 in P mode resolved issue but it also introduced additional 'softness' into image - which is normal for such small sensor. I didn't investigate further but it make me think that Canon is using some ND filter which is causing darker images in lower ISO (because of CMOS sensor?). This was still much better since in Auto mode camera was selecting ISO 800 and 1600 (just because of the high contrast situation - this was indoor with daylight).My all older ELPHs (with CCD sensor) are limiting ISO to 250 max in Auto mode which assured clean images (these are cameras with small CCD sensor, with their limitations so lower ISO is recommended and I could trust Auto mode).Another issue with 300HS is that camera is using high F (aperture) when zooming in (it's normal but not to this extent). Again, I never saw this on any of my older Canons... I would suggest to disable iContrast from menu, it will not eliminate problem but it will help a bit.Even some professional reviews are mentioning these issues.For example read: [...]---------------Auto flash produced dark results with our Indoor Portrait scene when set to ISO 100, and the camera selected 1/60 second shutter speed. However, switching over to the Slow-Sync mode results in a much brighter exposure, though shutter speed is a very slow 1/4 second. You'll definitely need a tripod at this setting to prevent blurring from camera movement. Shot taken at ~5 feet (~1.5m) on a stable tripod.---------------------Note that he is stating that that he could NOT take a clean ISO 100 image without using TRIPOD and Slow-Sync flash mode in this shot, which is indoor. It's same situation I experienced with daylight-indoor shot.He could do it with almost any other camera, in same situation, and since this is P&S, who will use tripod in real life? We buy these cameras not to use tripod and to rely on Auto mode or moment is gone.In his conclusion he also mentioned that images are soft,not sharp, but he recommended camera. By comparing pictures on the same site you can judge it by yourself and note that camera will ALWAYS use high ISO in Auto mode except in bright daylight outside.My initial thought was that I received 'dude' (something was wrong with a camera - and it was made in China). I went to closest Best Buy and Future Shop store and guess what, all other 300 HS and 100 HS were behaving same way, made in Japan or China, so nothing is wrong with a camera.Conclusion:This camera is having totally different, unwanted/bad, behavior from all older ELPHs I used which is affecting image quality. In Auto mode pictures are BAD majority of time as explained above.This can be done on purpose by Canon to make a difference between higher P&S model as S100. In my opinion Firmware is culprit. In any case, shame on you Canon for ruining such a nice device.We deserve better and these issues can be fixed in Firmware (which Canon will never do and I assume that's why camera went on sale for a half price).People owning this camera should email Canon and complain about it !I do NOT recommend this model because of poor image quality in Auto mode (which majority of people will use).If you don't believe me test it, I can guaranty you that cam will select high ISO even with wide open lens (f2.7). Check image - see that noise, softness and blown highlights if you had any bright spot?There are several 300HS owners that experienced same issues I described so read reviews with one and two stars.For me, this is so far nicest ELPH (looking into camera spec) and at the same time it produces worst images due to the bad firmware (lens could be better but I am happy with it).""

The biggest down side for me is when you are shooting video the zoom is agonizingly slow so if your subject starts to move after you have zoomed in for a shot its best to just stop filming otherwise you will get a good 10 seconds of background while you try to zoom out and find it again.  I take lots of pics of my dogs and while the single click shutter speed isnt mind blowing there is a pets setting that in combination with the burst mode makes my work SO much easier.I originally got this camera for my wife, but the last few times I didnt really feel like dragging out the rebel and all the glass so I grabbed this instead!""

"20111214","4.0","small compact, and ready to shoot","I just wanted to put my 2 cents on this. I originally wanted to purchase this to replace my S95, but comparing the pictures, the S95 always delivers better indoor pictures. The quality of the outdoor pictures are the same for both. There is slight better telephoto on the 300HS, but usually I don't use it at full telephoto. You get severe pin-cushioning on this small camera.Nonetheless, I think I'll keep both and perhaps use this one on my outdoor trips since it will get more abuse. It's definitely much slimmer, and more pocketable, though, I'd get a case for it. You really only have two choices from the canon line which is the psc-55 and the psc-1000. Do not get the psc-1050 as it will not fit. You may also want to go cheaper and just get a sleeve. You can purchase something like this from the palm pre line. It's a soft cloth that fits this camera perfectly. It also acts as cloth to polish your camera too.[...]I will say though, with this camera, you better have a steady hand for your indoor shots, still, a better value currently than compared to the newer 310HS which doesn't provide much more in my opinion.""

It does not come with a memory card or adapter so make sure to purchase one otherwise you cannot save your photos.""
"20111213","4.0","Good value for the money","Previously I owned a Sony DSC-N2 which at 10.1 Mp was a $300 camera 5 years ago. It took reasonably great photos with a few exceptions. I half expected the Canon to be on par since it is 12.1 Mp with similar features, knowing that the technology had improved over the last 5 years, even though it cost half as much. The Sony was fully 'touch screen' while the Canon is not. I just received it today and after charging the battery, took a variety of indoor & outdoor pictures, with and without flash, wide angle and zoomed. I did not test the video feature as I use a good Sony HD video camera and a GoPro HD video camera as well. I didn't buy the Canon for the video feature even though it got good reviews for the 1080 video quality.These are my initial positive impressions:1) better than average (compared to the Sony) in low-light (no flash) conditions.2) about the same weight as the Sony digital although thinner which makes it possible to store in a shirt pocket.3) turns on and is ready to shoot in half the time that the older Sony took.4) without reading the manual, I went through all the set ups successfully in 5 minutes easily (very intuitive UI).5) happy to see that it can shoot in 16:9 aspect ratio as this makes it easier to import into video presentations at the same ratio.6) at the mid brightness setting, the LCD screen is much brighter than the Sony at full brightness setting.7) with a SDHC card with a 4 Rating (not high), I was surprised at the rapid transfer rate. Slightly better than the Sony with the more expensive proprietory Duo-Pro card.Why only 4 stars ?  I reserve all 5 star ratings exclusively for products that exceed my expectations. 4 Stars means that it met all my expectations.Side note: I replaced the Sony because it developed an issue that I was surprised to see in a camera in that range. It was meticulously handled, never abused, carried in it's own case, inside another camera case. It developed a problem with either the CMOS or the image stabilization. When shooting indoors with excellent lighting, it produced blurry pictures while flashing an icon which interprets as 'either insufficient light or camera is not held steady enough'. Even on a tripod, with the camera set to use the timer, it still produced the flashing icon and blurry pictures. A very negative ordeal with Sony CR convinced me that Sony was no longer the brand to have ... in my opinion.""

I wish I have not sold my old camera on ebay.Pros - Good looking; decent price. Okay with low light. Great HD video. Good battery life. Video button is a good idea. Good 24 mm and 5x zoomCons - too many:--Blurry pictures and no manual override to correct focus;--Over exposure - picture too bright;--JPG Compression too high, losing detail; making the 12M looks like 8M but worse; And No RAW format to count on--Out of focus even at video mode - my kids were dancing and the camera struggles to find focus - result in out of focus video - why Canon why?--Not very sturdy. Don't put it in your pocket without the case otherwise, I can imagine you'd get lens errors like other reviewers.Like other reviewers, I tried many things to see if I can come up with better results but I could not.Unlike other reviewers who want to know where its made of, I don't really care.

Honestly, the Chinese workers are the most hard working. I would actually prefer stuff made in China, cause I know these workers are normal people. Assembly workers in Japan? That's so 80s. Only bombs in Japan would go work there. Same logic goes to labor work force in the US. We may have the best software engineers but best labors? Gimme a break. The Germans are different. I know they train professional workers like truck drivers for 3 years after high school. That's a trustable system. Anyway, my b.s. not related to Canon.I will keep this camera only because I sold my Kodak 893 - the 893 was great only a bit disappointing indoors.Canon, you'd better improve otherwise you will be just like Sony's TVs, getting killed by the Koreans and Chinese brands.----Updates ----Amazon lower the price by another $20 and don't have price protection? So I returned this one and got a new one. This new one can focus much better - I no longer have 50% of the blurry photos. Pictures still not as sharp (due to compression?) but at least its focused. So now I revised the rating to 4-star. It's good but not impressive; but consider the price its a good deal.""

"20111210","4.0","Not bad, not great","I bought this camera to replace a Samsung camera that stopped working.  I've had one Powershot before and never had any problems with it so I thought I'd try my luck with another one.  At first I thought it was a horrible camera, but I only used it on the auto setting.  Once I changed it from auto to manual and messed around with those settings, the pictures instantly got better.  It's still not the greatest camera I've ever owned, but hopefully it doesn't crap out on me like my last one did.Battery life is good, just like my last Canon.  I really like the compact size.  It's really small, but still easy to manipulate the controls.  I was able to get it on sale for $125.  I don't think I'd be willing to pay much more than that.  I'm fairly happy with this purchase, but I'm not expecting this to last more than a couple years before I'll start looking for a new one again.""
"20111210","3.0","I really want to like this camera!","This camera's build is very nice!  Good finish and feel.  Buttons are easy to use, unless you have very large hands.Outdoor photos in natural light are mostly good but the widest angle has severe distortion at the edges.Low light photos without flash are good due to the CMOS sensor.Taking indoor photos with flash is another story.  The auto white balance rarely gets it right, unfortunately.  Again the widest angle which I thought useful indoors in limited spaces, severely distorts everything but the center.  The flash cycles very slowly also, probably due to the small battery capacity.I'm disappointed with this camera in general, I was expecting better results.  My SD1200 took much better photos.I would recommend this camera with some reservations, but I would not buy this camera again.""
"20111209","5.0","Astonishing for $150","After getting this camera to replace my SD890, I took it on a week long cruise for testing.  Here's my findings for the black version:Pros:  (out of 5)Image quality 4.5 -  crisp, vibrant images.  JPG compression well done. Low light wasn't too impressive, but maybe I took it off Auto.  Auto settings good. Optical image stabilization awesome  ( boating pics turned out great despite wave rocking)Usability 4. - fast start up, fast image tracking, medium fast auto focus, medium fast flash charging, fast shutter speed.

"20111209","5.0","Nice Piece of Work","Purchased in the US for travel as I have grown fed up with poor performance of phone cameras, despite their portability.The small size but big screen make this a pocketable camera, but one that is at the same time easy to use, good screen size and menu design allow for a quick selection of the most important features.  So it's already seeing lots of use. A big range of features and modes is there instructions in the CD instruction manual for those who wish to explore the more esoteric modes, but you will soon settle down on a handful of modes that fit your choice of photography.The metal case gives the camera a little heft which helps steady the camera for low light / night time shots more compared to a plastic-only model.  Of course a tripod screw is on the underside, so timer shots, night photography at high resolution are possible.The 3MB burst mode is great for photography at parties or for candids as the kids play; you just need the discipline to ditch those pictures that actually aren't any good, and the pictures are a decent resolution.  Optical zoom is also flexible and quick; AF performance is quick and markers on screen show what the camera has focussed on to avoid those out of focus foregrounds discovered later in picasa.The higher resolution modes give great quality and allow close cropping without the images appearing pixcelated at decent size, or decent looking enlargements that aren't embarrassing when you get them back.All in all, a well specced truly compact camera with a quality feel and good ergonomics.""
"20111209","4.0","Nice features in an easy to take with you package","This camera is easy to take along, as it is small and lightweight.  The black finish is non-slip and looks nice.  The video quality is very nice and you can zoom in and out while taking video (optical at least...I keep digital zoom turned off).  Has quick to access scenes and has a dedicated video record button.  Also starts up fairly quick to begin taking photos.  My dad liked it too and bought one for himself.  One con is that I couldn't just cable it up and begin viewing...software had to be installed.  But a card drive is easy too and gets around that.""
"20111209","5.0","Great Camera For the Price - Beware of Amazon incentives, though","One of the reasons I bought this little camera was because of its reputation for taking good pictures in low light conditions.  And it indeed does an awesome job of it.  I can get pictures of the deer in my yard at night through the window with only the porch light on (no flash), and they turn out great.My only complaint has nothing to do with the camera itself.  Amazon offered Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 Ultimate or Corel Paintshop Pro X4 for only $9.99 as a reward when I bought this camera.  They sent a link in an email to use for this offer.  I never could get the link to work - kept taking me to some 'error' page.  So it was a bit like false advertisement to me!!""

So, obviously I like Canon products.This camera, however, has given me so many problems that I feel compelled to share. I've also been so frustrated with Canon and the warranty process that I wonder if I should stick with Canon in the future.I bought this camera in April of this year. In May, the lens got stuck in the extended position. I called Canon, sent the camera in, and a few weeks later they sent a new (refurbished) one. Now, the camera has broken again - exact same issue, lens stuck in the out position. They say this is rare - but given that it's happened twice, on two different cameras, I doubt that. I'm leaving for a 3 week international trip and customer service basically said that there's nothing they can do. I can send it in, wait a few weeks, and *maybe* get it fixed (only limited cases are covered under warranty apparently). If I want to take photos on my trip, I'll just have to just buy a new camera. They were also rude and insulting, suggesting it was my fault. It was definitely one of the worst customer services experiences I've had to date.Canon does make good camera products, but given the awful warranty/customer service support, I'd definitely think twice before buying again.""

Because: 1) Elph 300 has better video features - full HD, plus, you can zoom during the video recording; 2) the battery on Elph300 lasts at least two times longer. I was able to take more than 230 shots vs ~110 shots with S95; 3)  In terms of image quality not much difference. The S95 has a slight edge when shoot in manual, but IMHO it does not justify 2 times higher cost. I shoot mainly in auto mode, so no noticeable difference here.4) Elph 300 is significantly smaller.""

Returned it for a replacement, though.""
"20111205","5.0","If you are a laymen to point and shoot cameras, here's an easy review if this is for you.","A great camera, ranked 3rd among snapshot.com base on pricing, compact, sensors, etc against all the other point and shoot competitors that were even $499-$599 in retail price. I bought this during Black Friday on Amazon and it was $149. Its a great deal considering its one of the smallest to have a 24mm lens, shoots 1080 HD video (high quality). Its macro (shooting in close up) lets you close in on your subject up to 3cm in distance, something the Canon s95 (priced $299) couldn't even do. The one big thing that I couldn't stand is the sandpaper body. I have a sensitive touch and every time I pick up the camera, I have goosebumps. My girlfriend on the other hand, doesn't get any of this. I still give the camera a 5 star because the pros really out weight the cons. However, if you don't like the touch of really rough sandpaper, this will really get in your way. The low light of this camera is decently acceptable with canon's HS technology even though its sensor is a 1/2.3 meaning to say if you're shooting photos indoor, this camera will give you better results than most of the others competitors. But of course you can't compare this to a DSLR or higher end proconsumer camera because those sensors costs way more than this camera itself.If you're a casual photographer, this camera is decent enough to get you through most photo and video shoot. Lots of folks I know talk about camera lens, sensors, low light, af, noise, color of a particular camera saying the picture quality is bad or whatsoever without even realizing that even professional photographers have to depend on 3rd party flash light, great daylight and software manipulation to attain that stunning photo. The canon elph 300 HS is by far the best bargain for the cheapest and smallest point and shoot camera.""

I took very good care of the camera and used caution when using it.""
"20111205","5.0","Good Value, Easy to Use","I had some gift cards to use and thought how about a new camera?  I've been using an older Nikon S1 so I looked at the Nikon updated similar cameras as well as Canon (we have another in the house). I chose the Canon quite frankly because of battery charger similarity.  These kind of cameras are all a gift to photographers with any semblance of intelligence.Positives: Durable. Easy to use. Long Battery Life.  Good results in low light. Big (12.1) but not unmanageable file sizes.  Too big and I will have a hard time stitching photos, this size is perfect.Low Points: None really.  Lack of a higher zoom is NOT a low point.  Zoom past 3-4X is useless without a tripod, people, listen up!  These cameras with 12-21X zoom are unusable.""

For two years in a row, I used the old ELPH 600SD (only 6MPX) for my annual greeting card pictures and people couldn't believe that all pictures were taken with a pocket camera. (Of course, the lighting, subject matter, and composition make the picture, not the camera).Although it works fine, I just don't like the fact that the functions are painted on, not etched and painted. This one is even slanted. Take a look at the 'customer picture' area and you will see what I mean.Not really a big deal, but FYI.""
"20111203","2.0","Defective Camera","I had this camera 5 months ago but it was stolen. I recently bought another one off amazon on Black Friday and have been playing around with it for a week. I was disappointed to learn that the video playback on my computer was NOT clear; there were squiggly lines in it as if the camera was defective. In addition, the screen on my camera would randomly have squiggly lines too.Also, when I tested the zooming, it was much louder than my first camera. I have read some reviews about the quality difference between cameras that are made in China vs. made in Japan. My first camera was made in Japan; the one from Amazon is made in China. I was hoping this wasn't the case but I believe that's the reason my product is defective. I truly love the Canon 300 but am disappointed that I will have to return it.""
"20111203","5.0","Best quality you can get for under $200","Overall, this is the best under $200 camera you will find. My simple advice is: there is power in reviews. I looked at a dozen professional reviews for this camera and after 3 weeks of owning this camera, I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I will just list a few quick points about this camera rather than pro's and cons because there are a ton of other reviews doing that. If you don't have the time (or commitment) to read through this entire review, the first sentence of each bullet will summarize the point. Also do remember that out of cameras within 5 years old, this is the only one I've owned so I suppose you can take the review with a grain of salt. When it comes to me comparing it to other cameras out there, I am simply re-hashing what I read on other professional reviews. Think of it as me doing your shopping research for you. Bottom line, I highly recommend this camera.-I am not a professional, I am not an amateur, I am a casual user. I don't take photos for fun, I take them for the memories. I believe if you don't have the camera with you, it is worthless. But..if they are low-quality pictures, you will regret it in the future when you look back.-I bought this for $150, and you will not find another camera for a better value in my opinion! The other camera I was looking at was the Sony WX-9, but my bias towards Canon won out and I'm glad it did.-If you are shopping for a camera, shop by price. I know it shouldn't boil down to money, but the truth is it is all about money when it comes to electronic purchases. If you are willing to spend more, you will always find a better camera. Pick your budget and stick to it. In the under $100 range, I have no suggestions because I did not want to spend that little on a camera that I expect to last at least 5 years. If you are in the $200-300 range, I would suggest ignoring the basic point-and-shoot altogether. Get a Canon S95 (the newer version is the S100, but it is $120 more), it is a borderline DSLR while still being a compact. It has manual controls, control rings to adjust focus and aperture and ISO settings, and altogether is in a whole different class of cameras. Do note though that the S95 only has 720p video (although the new S100 has full 1080p video). I would not suggest the elph 500/510, because those are up near $300 and there is no reason to get a basic point-and-shoot that costs as much as cameras with decent manual controls and settings, not to mention much higher photo quality. Unless you must have a touch screen.. The pro's are a better user interface, a larger screen in general (because you don't have to place buttons on the layout), and the ability to select your focus point with a simple touch. The downsides are not being able to use it with gloves on, and a significantly lower battery life (the reason I didn't want one.)-The black camera has a sandpaper-like finish, while the silver and red versions have the traditional, somewhat slick finish. The black camera has the sandpaper finish that owners have either praised because it give more grip, or loathed because it felt cheap or picked up lint and dust too easily. I actually originally bought the black version because it was cheaper (also $150 at the time..but the silver was $180) and I knew about the texture going into it. When I got it, I thought I liked the sandpaper texture because it provided more grip, but after owning it for about a week, I didn't like it anymore because of said reasons. I bought the silver version for my brother because he was also in need of a camera, and lo and behold, it was a sleek, traditional finish. I liked it enough to return the black one i bought and get a silver one for myself.-There are indeed versions of this camera that are made in china, and others made in Japan. My thoughts (albeit just speculation) is that all these cameras were originally made in Japan, but considering the tsunami and the fact that there is a newer version (elph 310) out, production was shifted to China. There are others saying that only the Made in Japan versions are worth it because of the zoom 'knock' around 3.8x zoom in the China versions, but I will say that both of the cameras that my brother and I own do not have this problem. They both will have a motor zoom noise, but whether it has the knock or not I suppose it's just the specific camera you receive. Yes, traditionally Japan will have higher quality products than China, but in this case I did not notice a difference. I actually read another review (this one a professional one) that said the China versions had a quieter motor zoom noise, but that just depends on the specific one you receive. I actually was planning on returning mine to look for a Made in Japan one, but after playing around with it for a few weeks, I decided not to. Since the 'knock' isn't present, I figured they aren't going to get any quieter than what I have. If you are paranoid about it (as I was for a little while), good luck on your search.-turn off the 'AF-assist beam' setting for taking macros. In general, Infrared rangefinders are very inaccurate in short distances (under 6 inches), it will make it impossible to focus on close shots. The only time you need this setting on is when it is very dark (almost no light), but you want to take a shot with no flash. Then it will be able to properly find a focal length. But if there is light present, this camera will auto-focus without it. Also, when using flash, there is another setting in the camera that will allow you to use this infrared rangefinder only when you use flash.-there is a newer version of this camera, the Elph 310. The basic differences are: 310 has a 3' screen vs 2.7' and a higher resolution at 461k vs. 230k pixels, 310 has a macro rating down to 1cm vs. 3 cm, 310 has 8x zoom vs. 5x, but it has a worse sensor in it (maximum f3.0 aperture vs. f2.7..the smaller number actually means a better aperture on cameras). I don't know why a newer version would have a downgrade on it..but it does in this sense. This mostly only affect low-light shots without flash, but that is something that deterred me from upgrading. Professional reviews that I read said the overall picture quality of the 310 was slightly worse than the 300. The 310 also costs $200 while the 300 is $150 (assuming you find decent, albeit somewhat common sales on them).-The startup time is very quick (under 1 sec) and delay between pictures is also quick, assuming you turn review off. There is also almost negligent shutter delay. It focuses in under a second. Overall, a very fast camera. There are also high-speed burst modes (~8shots/sec, but at a lower, 3MP quality) and continuous shot mode (~3shots/sec, but full quality). Do note that the speeds of these shots is dependent on the memory card speed (see below). Also, their focus is dependent on the first shot's focus, so you won't be able to change subjects in the burst (same as any camera)-This camera has one of the best auto modes out there. If you are buying a point-and-shoot, I'm assuming you are not an avid photographer that is going to go through menus and settings to find a good photo, you just want to have the camera do it for you. I am a fan of not having to use flash if possible, so this camera was perfect for me. It has the best low-light pictures out of others in its price range. But in reality, the only difference between a camera with good picture quality and a camera with bad picture quality is its ability to take low-light pictures. Cameras from 8 years ago already had fantastic pictures in good lighting, but they were grainy and soft in low lighting. This camera is fantastic in low lighting settings. Reviews I read said it will be completely crisp up to about an ISO of 800, but even at 1600 I found it to be ok. High ISO settings require a longer exposure, so if you are very steady of hand or have a tripod, that will vary your 1600 and higher ISO photos (for the better or worse). But if you are taking pictures in that low of light, you'd probably be better off using flash.-Like other reviews have said, I am quite surprised that Canon did not prevent this, but there is a shadow in the bottom right-hand corner of pictures when you use flash, due to the flash area not being wide enough and it being too close to the lens. However..what isn't stated in most reviews is that the problem is dependent on the distance of the photos. At macro range (within 6 inches), the shadow covers almost an 1/8' of the corner, which is unacceptable as a photo, but that shadow gets much smaller as you get further away from your subject (somewhat common sense, but I might as well say it). at around a foot, the shadow is nearly gone, but still faint and present. Anything past 1 foot away there is no shadow. To be honest, 95% of your pictures that require flash are going to be taken from further than a foot away. I don't know anyone that takes macro shots in very low lighting that requires flash..they're all taken in good lighting. So..it is a big problem that you will most likely never encounter (making it a small problem?).-The image stabilization is very good in my mind. It isn't going to completely eliminate large vibrations from a very unsteady hand, but any regular shakes in you or the subject will not appear in the photo. Unlike almost all cameras in the under $200 range, this camera has true lens optical stabilization rather than a digital stabilization.-the video does cut off at 10min (or when you run out of memory), but you can always start taking videos again once it cuts off. I will admit, that can get annoying, but I suppose you don't really take long videos on a P&S, get a camcorder for that. I know other P&S cameras have limits up to 30min (the Sony Cybershots in particular), but that was just a minor irk for me.-Put a class 10 memory card in there. For 1080p video, anything less than class 6 will have your video cutting short because it cannot keep up with the filesize. But class 10 cards truly maximize the speed of the camera, going from being dependent on the card to the maximum limit of the camera's processor. This is useful in terms of the delay between shots, the speed of rapid shot bursts, and the speed of continuous shots. I would recommend Sandisk Extreme disks. I bought my 16gb class 10 for $24, but that was a black friday sale. Normal prices are 8gb for ~$20, 16gb for ~$35, and 4gb for ~$12. Class ratings for memory cards denote their minimum speeds: class 4 at 4mb/s, class 6 at 6mb/s, and class 10 at 10mb/s. However, the average speed for cards is not noted in class ratings. The sandisk cards have ratings of 'up to 30mb/s', and reviews I read on the cards have sandisk cards being almost twice as fast as other class 10 cards. 4gb translates to 15 min of 1080p video, 8gb as 30min, and 16gb as 60 min of 1080p. You will get well over 1000 pictures (the highest quality..largest size) with a 4gb card, so if you don't plan on taking any video, 4gb should be sufficient.-this camera has plenty of toys to it, but my favorites are the long exposures (up to 15s) and the slow-motion (high fps) movie modes. I live in Salt Lake City where the Christmas lights are absolutely beautiful, and to have a little fun, long exposures let you create effects with lights. You can write words with a flashlight, etc etc. This is also the same setting you use to get that motion-blur effect. Just make sure you are very steady of hand or have a tripod when using it, or your final subject will be blurry too. The slow motion video can be taken at 320*230@240 fps, or 640*480@120 fps. I prefer the slightly higher quality, but both these are somewhat low qualities. It's good for a laugh and entertainment though. There is no sound with the slow-motion movies though.I also wrote this as a reply to Stephan Krasner's review, but i figured it had good info in it so i will put it in a product review: ([...])I also purchased the elph 300 semi-recently, and I did not have the same problems you had with indoor and outdoor shots, sorry to hear that. You have to remember by default, this camera in auto mode will pick up an aperture/exposure from the entire shot's lighting (with the ability to change that in manual mode..but to be honest that isn't what people buy this camera for). This camera by far had the best auto-scene selection out of under $200 cameras out there in my opinion.As far as the screen goes, you might want to give the elph 310 (the new version of this camera) a shot if that is bugging you, it has nearly twice the resolution and a 3' screen vs. this camera's 2.7' screen. It is ~$200 rather than $150 though, assuming you do a little shopping to find a decent price (these were the most common prices I saw leading up to and during Thanksgiving). That was also one key concern when I bought this camera, but after playing with it in-stores, I found it to be decent enough for my liking. Do remember that there is an option in the menu called 'AF-Point Zoom' that magnifies the focus subjects on the screen, both while taking and reviewing photos (they're 2 separate settings). It's enough for me to tell if I got a good picture or not. But yes..it would be nice to have a Sony-quality screen on there. Just not essential.Concerning macro, I did notice that when you have the auto-focus assist beam (from the menu) on, macro shots have a very hard time focusing. Simple solution, turn this setting off. The only time the camera really benefits from having this setting on is in really really (near black) low light. With any reasonable light present, even semi-low lighting, the camera does a fantastic job range-finding a focal point in my opinion. This camera is rated at a 3cm macro distance (that is from the tip of the lens at 1x zoom, remember..), but I found it able to focus well down to almost 2cm. I really believe that auto-focus infrared lamp was what was making your images so blurry. The simple truth is infrared rangefinders cannot correctly read distances at that close of a distance, but they work really well at mid-to long distances (anywhere past 6in). That is the truth about infrared rangefinding, in this camera and any application. I got beautiful shots from macro, and i suggested the Elph 310 to you earlier, that camera is rated down to 1cm macro. Since you said you were a huge fan of macro shots, that seems like a high recommendation to you. I can post or send some macro shots I took, they look fantastic to my eyes. The thing I love about this camera is the quick-key tracking auto-focus by simply pressing the up button. As long as you have a steady hand and basic knowledge of maintaining distance to keep the focal length, the center-focus allows me to focus on the subject I want and then offset and reposition the shot I want after focusing. Works wonderfully.I am glad you have found a P&S you are satisfied with, but personally i find a difference of opinion when it comes to picture quality. I will admit, Sony Cybershots on average have much more bells and whistles, most notably their screen quality (most of them i shopped around for had 921k screens, vs. the 230k on this camera, or the 461k on the elph 310), but when it comes to picture quality (and with the elph 300/310's case, video), the Canon P&S camera's blow them out of the water. Canon puts the goodies where it counts, in the actual sensor and camera rather than its toys and trinkets. It's nice to have a nice screen, but this one was decent enough for me (esp with the af-point zoom setting on) considering pictures are taken to be shared on a large screen or printed rather than on the camera.I am by no means a professional photographer, but I don't think this phone was marketed to professionals. I wouldn't even call myself an amateur, simply a casual user that takes photos for memories, not hobby. If you want a compact but slightly more 'advanced' manual control camera, I would suggest the s95 ($300) or s100 (the newer version, albeit $120 more), but this completely satisfies me. It looks like Canon's marketing scheme is working..after buying this camera, which in my opinion is way above its pricerange and is the best value you can find on the market today, I am really enjoying photography and just might take it up as a hobby. One of these days I might fork over the big bucks for a borderline DSLR camera, but my philosophy still stands that if you don't have the camera with you, it is worth nothing. But you do have to remember that value is the entire judge of a products quality..if you are willing to fork over more money, there are always more competitors that are higher quality.""

"20111202","1.0","memory card","For those buying this camera, you need to know that a memory card is not included with it, therefore you will not be able to use this camera out of the box, even with the battery charged. Also, the Canon webite does not sell a memory camera specific for this camera. Don't be disappointed at Christmas, remember that the memory card must be purchased separately. The camera will not work without it.""
"20111202","5.0","Good camera within reasonable expectations","The Canon 300HS an excellent camera as long as you accept that it's not a 'baby S95.' If you want fast access to manual controls, this is not the camera for you. If you like scrutinizing the image pixel by pixel, this is not the camera for you. However, someone who's a non-photographer and wants good-looking photos from a small camera in 'Auto' mode will almost definitely love it.Likes:--------------1) Image quality is good for a camera in this price range. Yes, there is some mild corner softness at 100% magnification, and there are some chromatic aberrations in high contrast areas, but looking at the whole photo at any reasonable magnification, I'd be hard pressed to criticize the quality. The noise is well controlled, and there is enough fine detail to avoid the dreaded 'water color painting' effect of some other popular cameras. Auto white balance does a good job under a variety of lighting, exposure is generally spot-on, and low-light images are better than I expected. ISO 1600 is usable for small prints in low light.2) Video quality is very good. It uses a high bitrate compression, which eats memory fast, but I can see details in the video that other cameras simply smudge over. My only complaint is that the 1080p video is recorded at 24fps, and is somewhat choppy in motion. Switching to 720p or lower resolution results in 30fps video, which produces noticeably smoother motion. The stereo sound quality is decent, and the mics are plenty sensitive. When zooming during video recording, there is some motor buzz that's picked up by the mics, but it's only noticeable in a quiet environment.3) I like the 24mm wide angle lens, and prefer that over some 100x mega-zoom. It lends itself well to landscape shots, interior shots, close-ups, and other creative photography scenes.4) The camera is pretty quick to power on, and the controls have good response. It focuses in under 1 second, there is minimal shutter lag, and shot-to-shot times are about 2 seconds.5) The controls are intuitive, well-organized, and the buttons are plenty big for such a small camera. I had most functions figured out in a few minutes without having to resort to the manual. The mode switch provides a convenient thumb rest when holding the camera.6) Construction and build quality seems solid. I bought mine at a local store and made sure to get the version made in Japan. I haven't observed the problems mentioned by other reviews, like shaky video zoom or easily scratched finish. The battery door seems somewhat fragile, though.Dislikes:--------------1) When completely zoomed out, the lens casts a shadow from the flash in the lower right corner.2) Video mode is mostly automatic, you can't even adjust exposure compensation. I have older compact cameras which can do this, it would have been nice to have that feature here.3) The quick-set menu is somewhat slow to operate because it does not present as much information at once as other cameras, for example Panasonic's Q-menu. It's a vertical layout with vertical submenus, whereas a horizontal layout with vertical submenus would have been better.4) There is no wind-cut option for the microphones.I'm not taking points off because these are relatively minor issues, considering the camera is aimed at a novice user. It's not perfect by any means, and it's missing some toys found in other cameras, like a high resolution screen, auto HDR, or auto-stitching panorama. However, if your priority is the end result - the quality of images or video coming out of the camera - this one stands above the competition. I would recommend it to anyone looking to produce good-looking photos with minimal fuss.""
"20111202","3.0","Canon is riding on it's name.","The Canon I had before this one was more expensive ($250) but not that much more expensive and it took way better pictures with a superior build quality. The body was metal, but the battery/SD compartment felt cheap and flimsy as did the zoom control ring around the shutter button. A 240k LCD may have been good 3 years ago but my cell phone has had a better LCD for years, it's definitely an important part of the camera so you can see what you have shot in the field. They should have stepped it up a little more here. The form factor on the other hand is VERY good. It's the best looking small camera I have ever owned. The controls on the 300 hs are better than my old Canon.Despite having a back-lit CMOS chip, pictures indoors were washed out, blurry and extremely grainy. My old canon had this problem too, in fact ALL Canon compacts have this problem. They cannot seem to perform well indoors. The photos were either washed out so you could not see any detail, or they were grainy and blurred. Think night time security camera.Outdoors, the performance improves significantly, but still not enough to replace my old Canon. Bright light will completely blow out objects. Distortion is harsh outside around the edges of the photo. Trees for example become silhouetted by light lines. Outdoors on a sunny day is usually where canon compacts shine, but the 300sh is a big disappointment here. The colors however were extremely accurate, but if you are looking for a camera to take to the slopes, look elsewhere. I took it to a football game expecting to get some good action shots and almost every shot was blurred and hazy IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!The macro was the biggest disappointment of them all. This is usually another point where canon compacts shine, but with this one, I had a very hard time focusing on what I wanted, shots also blur a lot easier than my old camera. I am a big fan of macro sots. this is one point that has inspired me to return the camera. Honestly my Blackberry torch does smoother macro than this one...At one time cheap canon compacts were my instant go-to solution for a carry around. This camera felt like an old camera. From the screen to the images, complete disappointment all around. I have since switched to the Sony Cybershot WX9 and I can say with out a doubt that you are getting more bang for your buck, and way better picture quality.""
"20111202","5.0","High Quality and Compact","I purchased this prior to going away on vacation, which for many of you is a probable reason that you are looking at the camera. My overall experience was great. It has a high quality lens, something Canon is known for. It also has a decent sized screen for easy viewing after photographing. The fact that it is 12.1 megapixels is great for my purposes. A lot of people see the new cameras and see 14.1 megapixels, 16 megapixlels and more. Megapixels only help when enlarging a photo. You will have no problem enlarging a photo to almost any reasonable size with this camera. If you need anything bigger, I would recommend a Digital SLR. In summary, great camera, great price, overall a great deal.""

I love the texture of this one I'm not sure if it's just in the black model I got but it's a sandy rough texture.  The camera takes amazing pics and I love all the little features.  It's simple to use without even needing to go through the manual and takes amazing pictures!!Thanks Canon!""
"20111201","5.0","What a deal!!","I was looking to replace my old Canon S80, I like the S80 and the great quality pics it produces but it is too bulky and it was becoming an inconvenience and the 300 HS is a quality camera packed into a sleek body that I can easily slip into any pocket.  I keep the S80 for the stadium and family get togethers, but the ELPH 300 will be my everyday and traveling camera.Most Canon cameras take great shots, but what is most impressive about this camera is its low-light capabilities. Indoor night shots without the flash come out amazingly crisp, the autofocus is quite impressive as it tracks faces in the frame, the menu functions are quite intuitive, and it's got plenty of preset shooting modes, and fast between shots for a Point and shoot.I also compared the 1080p video. The video quality is excellent with the 300 HS, low-light video is slightly grainy but good, in the daylight the video comes out great, and is easy to import into computer files.I did purchase an extra battery after reading battery life can be short. I've had the camera a since Cyber Monday ($129.00 w/4G SD card, case, and $10.00 gift card) and have used it daily without a need to recharge yet. One of the best days of my life.I'd recommend the black body as it has a lightly rough textured finish that makes holding this small camera much easier.Overall, considering the excellent quality of the camera, easy portability, and great price, this camera is worth every penny.""

So far I have been very happy with the Canon as it powers up quickly and takes pictures quickly as well. The only thing I liked better about the Nikon was the fit and finish. The black buttons are OK on the Canon, and everything functions just fine, the Nikon just looks sleeker. So far the picture quality is just as good, if not better than the Nikon. The camera is also the same size as the Nikon it replaced, so if fit nicely into the same compact case. Hopefully this one will last longer than 3 months!""

So compact you won't feel the difference between it or your cell phone in your pocket.  Also very quick and easy to use. My experience with other point and shoots is that they all are kind of slow to turn on, snap pictures/ record video. Canons have always excelled at speed.The main reason I purchased it though was so I can take advantage of the 1080p 24fps movie recording.  Amazing quality that you don't expect out of such a camera. Also the extra wide angle lens makes movies feel more like one of the bigger expensive cameras out there. Image stabilization makes it more user friendly than a t2i. Here is an example of what a 1080p movie can look like -[...]There are some gripes though. The lens protector seems a little flimsy. I dented mine inward and it would not close properly until I 'undented' it back. Night shots can be tricky. I would also prefer the old way of deleting pictures on the old Elphs. This one adds an unneeded extra step to delete a picture. Also the movie recording can sometimes get iffy with the focus.These are just little things though. The camera is packed with features, takes great pics AND great video. 24mm wide angle lens and 1080p at 24fps, what else do you need at this price range?Just get it. =)""

The camera is very compact and if you are familiar with Canon cameras the functions are all very much the same.  We have used the camera for the last few weeks and overall it is great.  The photo quality is great, auto focus is as fast as any other point and shoot camera, the menus are easy to navigate and the video quality top notch.  The one button video recording is the best feature and one of the reasons the camera was purchased.  It makes capturing the moment a snap without having to change settings on the camera.  There are a couplrpe things that could be improved.  1) The flash is where you naturally put your finger so it blocks the flash and ruins the picture in lower light settings.  You just have to be a little careful how you hold the camera. 2)  The zoom in and out seems a little slower than other cameras I have used.  It is adequate but ther have been a couple instances where the slower zoom lead to a lost picture.  3) It is almost too small.  It is easy to stash in your pocket but also very easy to drop.

"20111127","5.0","The only camera a person needs (outside of pros)","I have to say this really is honestly the only camera youd really need unless you are a professional photographer.  It is small enough to carry around anywhere and not have any excuse not to bring it with you when you go places and it takes good quality pictures that dont look like they were taken with a cheap consumer camera right away if framed properly.  Not only that but the video quality of the camera is as good as if not better then most consumer HD camcorders out there.  Now at first you may think well such camera would be useless for good videos because it being so small there is no way to really keep the video steady. Thanks to optical image stabization the camera stays very steady even handheld.  Its image stabilization is actually superior to my Canon HD camcorder which i paid 3 times as much for.  This is wonderful as it means you can have one device thats small enough to take anywhere that can take good pictures and excellent video and the video is at 24 frames per second which is rare for a consumer small camera that is the same rate as film so you can get a nice cinematic look.The camera has a very nice wide angle lens that really stands out as you can get more stuff in the shot like people and enviroments (is also great for taking pictures of indoor things like rooms in your house or places you visit) compared to my mothers kodak easyshare camera the view that it capture is significantly more.  It also is great for video too as was the problem with my older camcorder i felt i had to back up most times to get things in the shot.I have used a Digital SLR and dedicated HD Camcoder (that used tape) and i must say this is a real joy to have. I had not been using my SLR and Camcorder that much as having an ipad now i just didnt feel like carrying them all around and switching back and forth.  (the Powershot also has better auto white balance then the SLR i used) for a pro you might want a more advanced camera but for the average user this is a wonderful camera to havethe only downside i saw is that sometimes apparently the battery cover may come off, but thankfully you just snap it back into place with no problem. Also battery life is a bit on the low side as if you are out on a trip or out and about for like a day and taking a lot of video and pictures the battery will not last all day , my suggetion would be to to get a spare battery from amazon and then have both so you are set!a 16 gig memory card will net you about 1 hour of HD video or about 6,000 photos (photos are only around 1 meg each ish so dont take up a ton of space which is nice)If this thing was out 6 years ago at the price it is now i would have gotten this instead of paying $2,000 for the camera and camcorder i got.  It really is a great little camera (it also does non-HD slow motion video which is a neat bonus too!)  the video quality is superb and picture quality is very good as well.a great camera expecally for around christmas.  Yeah most cell phones have cameras now days but most cell phone cameras are so so at best this wuold easily in my opinion beat any cell phone camera and the video expecally would beat any cell phone video (or even the iphone/ipad2 video)and this in my opinion also beats the flip video devices you can get. as this camera offers more steady shots (which in my opinion is absolutely essential with HD video the steadier the video the better it is)great product! Having it means theres no excuse not to capture great pictures or video!""

"20111125","3.0","Camera operates great, case feels flimsy","I've been a long time lover of Canon point and shoots, and this is my third.However, immediately out of the box - this camera just felt cheaper than my others (I'm replacing a Canon SD780 that I used for a couple of years). It feels more plastic-y, flimsy and the buttons less integrated. Trusting in Canon's reputation for quality I proceeded to unpackaging the rest of the accessories and charged up the battery.I at first bought the red case version after looking at the black version on display. I was disappointed that the red doesn't have the rubberized finish of the black.  And then was more disappointed that after just a few minutes of navigating menus and checking it out, I noticed a huge scratch on the camera. I don't recall bumping it, dropping it or doing anything that should produce such a huge scratch.  So I wrapped it up and took it back and got it exchanged for the black case version.  I'm hoping I just got a defective coating on that one, but do be cautious of the camera's finish if you opt for a colored one.I've been using the black case version since May 2011, and have been pretty happy with it. The wider angle lens as compared to my SD780 is definitely nice.  And I am able to get better shots in low light conditions. All and all tho, I consider this a transitional camera that I'll upgrade to something else soon enough. After just a few months of use, I feel ready for something better.""
"20111125","4.0","Made in Japan","I know there has been much talk about made in Japan vs China ones with regard to the zoom motor noise while recording video.  I ordered the silver one from Amazon (not a 3rd party seller) on 11/22/2011 and received it today and am pleased to see mine was made in Japan.  Now this may not be the case for everyone, but apparently they still have stock of the silver that is made in Japan.  Once I have time to play around with it I will update this with a real review of the product.""
"20111125","4.0","Great little camera","I love this little camera, I had the Canon powershot sd 780 before, this camera is pretty much the same, with pretty much the only difference I saw was 1080 on the video and stereo sound. It has a black flat finish which is nice , you don't get the scratching on the body that I did on the old one. The pictures are great and the Video is fantastic. I was hoping the sound would have been a little better, I usually video some of the live bands , and was hoping for better audio, but was a little disappointed. Over all its a Canon, and you really cant go wrong with Canon, the price was good, and the shipping was fantastic, literally 1 1/2 days , and that was with free shipping. Bottom line is I love the Canon Powershots, so much, that I bought this one over my last one, strictly for the 1080.""

Now I gotta wait a week for it to come x]""
"20111124","5.0","Not the smallest but the biggest in value","Canon's pronouncements for this camera practically holler out that it's the 'thinnest in the world!'  Sorry, but Canon's SD-780, which is now out of production but still selling on Amazon, takes honors as the company's smallest in height, width, and breadth.  So if bragging rights are important to you, be prepared to pony up twice as much for the SD-780 (which has become an 'appreciating asset').  I loved my 780 before I lost it but was not about to pay twice as much to replace it.  The Canon Elph 300 marks a return on the part of the company to the qualities that made their Canon SD 1000-1200 subcompacts as well as the SD-780 the runaway favorites, if not only choice, among 'casual' consumers looking for a convenient but capable point-and-shoot subcompact.To my eyes, the 300's photos are every bit as good as the SD-780's, while the 5X-power lens makes it more flexible and useful than the 3X-power lens of the SD-780, which didn't qualify as having either a wide-angle or a telephoto lens.  I see some reviewers expressing regret that the 300 doesn't boast even more megapixels than 12. But the enthusiasts and pros (or serious photographers who insist on a genuine SLR monster) are demanding fewer megapixels, not more.  16 mps won't necessarily get you better resolution or sharper pictures but it will eat up all the space on your memory card in a hurry, especially if you use the very good video capabilities of either of these cameras.  As a result, the higher-end 'bigger' cameras are now likely to compromise at 10 megapixels rather than chase a popular consumer market obsessed with higher numbers.The 300 has few manual over-rides and is unlikely to satisfy someone hoping to win top honors in a photo-shoot.  But it's a dependable yet versatile little thing (with 1080p video and a stereo mic!) that's user-friendly, intuitive, and a quick read (some of the manuals with the bigger cameras require months of studying).  If you need further assurance, pick up Consumer Reports Buying Guide for 2012.  Out of 139 sub-compact cameras, the Canon Elph 300 comes in 9th place.  (The Canon S95 places 2nd out of the 139, but it'll cost you at least twice the price of the Canon Elph 300.  On the other hand, the Leica V-Lux 20 will cost you more than 4 X more than the Canon 300, yet it's rated lower by CR, which places it in the 10th spot.)There are those who will pay these inflated premiums in order to claim that they own the world's smallest camera (the Elph 780) or that theirs is a, gasp, 'Leica'!  I'm happy to give them that advantage and simply enjoy the shots I'm getting from this pocket rocket (definitely superior to my wife's iPhone).  If you're a 'serious' photographer looking for a 'side-kick' accessory camera, or if you're looking for a camera that will last for a good while under adverse conditions, the Canon S95 subcompact may be the better choice if you can afford it.  It has a lens of 'only' 10 megapixels, and video resolution of 'only' 780 pixels.  But fastidious photographers know that those numbers are merely manufacturer's consumer 'bait.'  The S95 would definitely appear to be the better-built camera with more user-accessible, manual features than the fully automated, lightweight, slightly smaller 300.  There are copious examples of shots taken from both cameras on the web--dpreview, steves-digicams, cnet, etc.  I've studied them and frankly don't see consistently superior image quality from the S95 when comparing it to the 300. So the S95 represents an 'investment' in a more rugged, hobbyist camera, for someone who shoots RAW and fusses around in Photoshop.Since photography is no longer my main focus in life, I'm content with the performance of the 300 and am simply hoping it holds up as well as an S95.  As for the world's thinnest camera, the 300 is .8' thin; the discontinued SD-780 was/is .7' thin.  Not enough of a difference to motivate me to replace my prodigal, long-lost, once-lamented Elph 780.  The 300 has already erased lingering regrets over its absence.""
"20111123","1.0","WOW Awful Quality","I have had many canon sd cameras before and was pretty happy with all of them. This camera is not really canon quality. It has a flimsy plastic-hinged door over its battery/memory card compartment - it is a matter of time when it breaks. The pictures come out very soft and there is a horrible lens noise when zooming in/out. The product I received is made in china. May be this has something to do with the quality. I am returning the camera - big disappointment. Please read other reviews of the camera before buying it. Good luck!""

"20111121","5.0","Great "Burst Mode" for Action Shots","Have had this camera for a month or two now from a previous purchase. But saw the great price just now and decided to get another. This camera meets all of the needs I have in taking photos of dogs at the local animal shelter to help get them adopted. What I needed was something great in low lighting without flash due to the shiny reflection off of dogs' eyes with flash, as well as a super fast burst mode to try to capture that just right pose when the dog smiles, but without having to guess when the dog will smile.  So I just start pressing and it takes like 8-10 shots in a second or so.  Fantastic!  And the HD video of course is great, which I use to make videos of the dogs playing with toys or with other dogs to show off they energy levels or socialability with other dogs of various personalities.Don't shop, adopt a shelter pet! :O)""

"20111121","1.0","Yet another spectacular failure from Canon","I simply don't understand how this camera managed to get so many positive reviews.Yes it's compact, fast, pretty and inexpensive. But it fails where it matters most - producing quality images in auto mode.Pictures are coming out soft, non-contrast, underlighted. And wide angle lens added a new 'feature': if your picture features tall objects on the sides (trees, buildings), and is shot below horizontal optical center, they would be 'falling down' to the middle of the picture. Big way falling. Pisa tower falling. Get your cropping skills polished.I bought this camera as a replacement for SD1400, which had another big problem - 'soapy' corners on most pictures. So far I don't see how the new camera is better - it's still a lot of cropping, with even less contrast.I think, Canon got too carried away with adding new features and forgot about the most important thing - quality of the picture.The last reliable Elph I had was SD1200. With less pixels, less macros it was producing far better quality pictures than anything that came from Canon after it.Something tells me it's my last point-and-shoot from Canon. Very disappointed.Update 11/23/2011: returned to AmazonUpdate 12/02/2011: just got a Canon SX230 - what a difference! Such a quality pictures, minimal distortion on a wide shots, and 14x zoom is simply unbeatable for the size. Should have bought it from the beginning.Let me just re-iterate my findings: Canon 300 HS is simply a bad camera producing bad pictures, looks like Canon had cut a lot of corners while making it. Spend few bucks more and get yourself a real camera, not a cute toy.""
"20111121","5.0","AWESOME camera especially if you have kids!","We got this last week, and HOLY COW this is the most awesome camera! We have a 3.5 year old daughter who is very active, and a  baby boy on the way. We had a friend visiting with her 7 month old daughter, and using the high speed burst function I was able to get the most awesome pictures of the girls together. I can't wait to play with all the other settings, but I know the high speed burst will be my go to. The high speed burst function is an absolute must if you have kids! Point, hold down the shutter button, and it takes pictures continuously until you remove your finger. When perusing them on the computer you get a neat flip book effect too!Another awesome feature is the switch between auto and manual. When you turn off the camera, it automatically comes back to whatever setting you had it last. Even if you remove the battery, it still comes back to that feature! The screen is nice and large, and the slightly roughened texture of the camera makes it nice and secure so you won't drop it. This camera is fabulous!""

The metal clam shell that opens and closes every time you prepare to shoot stopped opening in the 1st week of actually using the camera.  It might have been due to the fact that I did not get the accessories package with it and get the case that comes with it.  It also did not come with a flash card so i could not start using it when I first received it, I did not see any mention about that when I bought it.  If they did say something it did not jump out at me.  Now I'm stuck on a 3 leg trip with only a cell phone camera.  I will replace it but I would not buy it new again.  Very disappointing!""
"20111117","2.0","Did not live up to expectations...","I had this for a few months before I sold it.  Granted this is a P&S, but I expected this camera to take images at least as good as my 2008 Lumix FX500.  It does not.  I thought most of my images were out of focus but now I think it just takes very soft images.  It applies way too much noise reduction which I think leads to the softness, but also in some of my images the subjects, whether they be people, foliage, etc., appear fake and smooth-like.  The images also have a general feeling of haziness with the colors muted.  I really don't know what was going on and how Canon could make such a bad camera.  I tested all settings and experimented with the limited manual control and nothing made it better.  I am giving Canon another shot and since purchased an S100.  I immediately noticed the images were much better, albeit at a different price point.""
"20111117","4.0","Some are made in China, some in Japan","I really like this camera since upgrading from a Canon SD1100 IS.  Hd video is a much needed upgrade however if you do alot of video you would still be better off with a dedicated camcorder.  The HD quality is way better than on my SD1100 which was only low quality SD.The black color looks good and the gritty feeling on the paint job makes it less likely to slip out of your hand.  The red color is very slippery in comparison.  I ordered the black and red and found out I like the black better.  Red was too slippery and bright but thats just a personal preference.  I found out that both the black and red were made in China.  However I seen the same camera at a Target and Best Buy and both the black and red were made in Japan.  I would rather have Made in Japan.  My old SD1100 was also made in Japan. So unless you buy it from retail store you won't know for sure.  However, Amazon's price is usually better..There are many new settings for taking pictures and the menu and feature layout is very familiar to the SD1100.  The changes that were made I like better.  Overall satisfied with this camera so far except for being made in China. Maybe Amazon could start adding where the product is from or manufactured so customers can have one more piece of information before deciding to buy.  I think for the price and features this is a great camera for a good price.""

We've been trying to replace our 6 year old Canon Powershot A620.  It's 7.1 Megapixel, the pictures are great, but it's a little slow and it's also bulky.  We tried a Lumix last year and even though it was a 12 megapixel camera, the shots were not coming out as sharp as our old Canon.  So we returned it.  We decided to give this Elph a try.  What we liked:  the small size, the quick shots, and lots of neat features.  What we didn't like...once again, the old Canon's shots were coming our sharper.  Hard to believe.  We did some more reading and found that these higher megapixels compacts don't always mean sharp shots.  Now we are returning this one too.""
"20111113","2.0","7 yr. old Olympus 4MP camera has given me much much better results","As many others have pointed, I really don't understand why this camera is getting such high rating. Either people haven't seen better (I've a hard time believing this) or they have forgotten and got used to these days' low standards.I bought Olympus C4000 - 4 MP - camera in 2004 Apr. It has produced amazing results. Very rarely it used to let me down, if at all. It had no optical image stabilization either.Contrast that with Elph 300 with 3 times higher res. and optical IS. Out of my first 68 shots, only 2 or 3 turned out really crisp. I don't have time to debug why it didn't produce better results. Off it goes back to the vendor (note that I didn't buy it from Amazon).Really, really disappointed.""

While there is the basic automatic mode and there is a manual mode, the manual mode lacks sophisticated options. The zoom is pretty decent but trying to use the camera in manual mode with no flash leaves you with blurry pictures. If you are looking for a simple point and shoot then this is great camera for you, if you are looking for a camera with some customizations then I would go another route. I purchased this one because I was hoping to get the quality of a Canon and the simplicity of use for my husband's usage. I find myself retaking pictures quite frequently because I'm just not happy with the quality.""

This reviewer used the Canon ELPH Powershot 10.1 mp version for years with good results, and found this updated version easy to master.The texture of the camera casing is roughened, a little like very fine industrial sandpaper, making the camera easier to hold under wet/cold conditions.  The kit includes the usual cables for downloading images and printing using a computer and/or a printer.  The digital camera software for image manipulation seems straightforward and intuitive to use.  For this reviewer, the Canon Powershot ELPH 300 is highly portable, a great camera for happy snaps, and good for general indoor/outdoor photography; highly recommended.""

So much that its uncomfortable to hold. I think there are a lot of people who wouldn't be bothered by this, but for me its so unpleasant that I am returning it and buying the silver one instead, which I understand has a more normal texture/finish. I had the Canon S95 in the past and it had a faintly rough texture which I really liked, and this camera is totally different. If you are used to the texture of the S95 this one is not the same.Aside from the texture, the camera is great. I expect that I will like it just as much as the Canon S95 that I used previously. It does feel a bit small in your hand. I'm sure that after a short period of time, I would get used to that and appreciate the convenience of the small size.""

Esp so for large knobby hands.Plastic shutter button not as definitive in feel - esp during pre-shot focusing - however not a dealbreakerSome hv reported the problem of some shaking during video zoom between 3.8-4.8x but I doubt mum will be using that feature! [Update: Ive just seen the video clip on 'the shake' - be good to fix this though it is not as bad as I had envisaged, probably forgivable for beginners, as the audience will probably think it's the cameraman and not the camera.For most ppl, this camera will have more than enough.  Which explains why it tops the charts.An additional consideration:  If grip is important, then the black textured finish may be a better option. However I have also read that the textured finish tends to pick up lint along the way and may be difficult to keep clean, plus tends to get snared in one's pockets (the good out of this is that it doesn't drop out nor gets pick-pocketed as easily).  It is interesting that colour choice could have such large implications. Perhaps the product description should state the textural differences as I'm sure it was intentionally different to provide choice in taste & functionality.I, OTOH buy most things in silver, in this case I was beginning to wonder if I had made the right choice as I had bought it for an elderly person with a little arthritis - she had found it rather slippery and I had subsequently read about the black casing providing better grip.  Well ... at least this clears it up. I would loathe having to try and remove lint from its sandpaperish surface.  Hopefully over time, grip could come with a little practice.""

The product has everything else that you need in the box.Let's begin with Quality of Product coz a lot say it look cheap and blah blah blah.... I bought Silver color of this Model. I opened the box and It was well packed in a foam bag. I slide it out.... and WOOOOWWWW!!!! I took a deep breath and wanted to yell. It had AMAZINGLY UNBELIVEBLY EXCELLENT FINISHING. The camera looked really good and great. In no way/aspect it looks cheaper. The size is so compact and thin. My friend was with me when I opened it and she was like WOW so cute small camera. She also bought it. So imagine if a person can just buy the camera looking at it, it's got to look great and good finishing.Now let's go to the photography part: I clubbed it with my Transcend 8GB class 10 memory which I bought separately with it. I have to say the memory is sufficient and photos that I took and transferred were great. The ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM is like I have written. You can see clear things from a distance without any distortion (but don't try to shoot moon from this camera). Anyways the Video part wow I was spell bounded by the stability feature no pixilation of any part and yes FULL HD 1080p. I connected it to see it on a projector through an HDMI cable. I saw it on 105 inch screen and then in my conference hall HD projector and no pixilation anywhere. It comes with Video zoom to good and stabilized level with a great video output. The camera offers a zoom of 5X and if you push further it offers 20X zoom and NO PIXILATION at all. Stabilty factor remains true and yes I can read and see everything clearly.So I would say forget this camera looking Cheap or plastic. It looks CLEAN, EXCELLENT, EXPENSIVE AND GREAT VALUE.The usage of menu is very easy and simple just like previous canons. Has been updated and looks better and easy to move and select options. No messing around and getting confused with the touch options. I have tried touching camera menu on different camera and believing me every time clicked something else so this is good with buttons to press and manage. Only I wish it had Panoramic Photo click ability.Comes with feature rich in it I didn't even have had time to use all but wanted to write this review to make sure if someone is planning to buy this and drops out thinking looks cheap may be give it another thought. I have silver and don't look cheap at all. Something about my taste I don't like cheap anything either. So I would say take my chance on Silver color.I would recommend if you are looking for Value for money product and GREAT AND FULL RICH EXPERIENCE OF HD POCKET CAMERA!!!""

"20111110","5.0","Great and User-Friendly Camera","You say you want a user-friendly, small digital camera that you can pull out of your pocket and get greats shots on the spur of the moment? You're looking at the right camera. The end of Dec 2010 I purchased a Nikon digital (with manual options) for between $300 and $400 and in the few months I tried to use it never got a really good shot of anything or anyone. In June of 2011 I purchased this Canon Elph 300 and as soon as I opened it, I knew I had the right camera. I have had SLR's so I'm not ignorant about camera operation, but the Canon is so much more 'user-friendly' than the Nikon it's not funny. I know it's all in what you want - and in someone else's hands, good photos could probably be taken with my Nikon - but if you want a no fuss, easy to use camera - this is THE ONE!!!  S Sergent""
"20111110","5.0","Outstanding little camera","I bought the Elph 300 HS after much research and deliberation, as a replacement for another Canon camera I had owned for years, and broke through my own carelessness. I've had good experiences with Canon quality before, so I was already leaning in that direction. I also didn't want to spend more than $200.This camera has exceeded all my expectations. It is truly lightweight, I have no problem taking it with me on everyday excursions, just in case I see something I think would be worth shooting (my camera phone is woefully inadequate). It is also VERY durable. I have dropped this camera twice (not in its case), both times from about four feet above the ground. Once it landed on concrete, the other time on a wood floor. As a result, the black casing is slightly scuffed up now, although it's not hugely noticeable. AND, the camera has continued to work perfectly. Considering we live in an age where so many things are made withough much regard to quality, since it is expected that we'll re-buy/upgrade our possessions constantly, I am truly gratified to see that Canon obviously made this camera intending for it to last.As to image quality, I am an amatuer, not really even at enthusiast level yet, but I think the image quality is really great. I also appreciate all the different scene modes and filters, and it's been so interesting working with them, that this camera actually inspired me to pursue photography again more seriously. I have a Nikon DSLR, but it was too much to lug everywhere, so I kind of just abandoned photography in general. But the Elph 300 has been so much fun to use, it inspired me to buy another digicam with shutter and aperture priority modes, so I can get back to exploring photography more fully yet still conveniently (and maybe even put my Nikon to full use someday).Speaking of manual controls, that's really the only thing this camera lacks (it does have Program mode, so you do have a bit of control over white balance and ISO). The Elph 500 does have the manual controls the 300 lacks, but I despised the touch screen, which I found was not nearly as responsive as, for example, an iPhone. But, keep in mind, this camera was never intended to be targeted to people who want full manual control. It's a small, take anywhere point and shoot that takes great pictures without you having to fiddle with it or think much about it. And as I said, there is some increased flexibility with the filters and scene modes provided (and there are quite a few of them).There may be a learning curve with the menu system for non-Canon users, but nothing that a little bit of time and the manual (in PDF form, it's not printed) wouldn't take care of. Current Canon owners will find it very familiar and easy to use.I would recommend this camera whole-heartedly for anyone who wants a lightweight P&S with great image quality, that's also simple to use and still provides a good number of creative options. This would be a wonderful intro camera to those completely new to digital photography. I gave this camera 5 stars because, for the audience it's intended for, it's an oustanding choice, and one which I can't find any fault with. People who want full manual controls will need to look elsewhere (e.g. higher-end digicams and DSLRs), but for a well-built, no-fuss camera you can take anywhere and have a lot of fun with, this is an excellent choice.""

You will not be disappointed with the quality of the photos.""

For a point and shoot camera this camera has great potential to take fast decent quality shots. I can then connect it to my P4 and show the class examples of how to take quick pictures. This works for me, because we often go around the campus and I can project anywhere on the white walls. I can also show the students the view I am seeing through the camera and the angles I need in order to make it work because of the projector. This is a battery intensive process and the Canon PowerShot ELPH doesn't die on me even though I virtually have it on and projecting the entire time. Would recommend.""

The zoom gives you some pretty good closeup shots.  I sell things on Ebay and need a good camera for detail.  This one works very well.  I wish it had a viewfinder like some of the old cameras but I've gotten used to doing without it.  The only problem is in the bright sun with sunglasses on, I can't see a blessed thing on the screen.  So I just take lots of photos and usually they are all great.""

"20111026","3.0","Nothing amazing here... just ok image quality","Either people have lower expectations in terms of image quality or I got a lemon. I'm comparing mine to Canon S410 that I also own.Issues with this camera:1. Camera keeps switching 'scenes' in Auto mode and it's often choosing incorrectly:  a) It tries to do tracking when no tracking is required  b) It often fails to detect macro mode2. Focusing algorithm in Auto mode often refuses to choose a subject that I'm actually interested in. Example: it would often ignore people in the foreground and focus on some background instead.=> 1 and 2 make Auto mode unusable for me...3. Focus is soft most of the time (S410 didn't have this problem). Focus is especially soft in image corners. Changing 'Sharpness' in Custom Colors in Program mode does help a bit.4. In macro mode it's often impossible to make it focus on the feature you want even using Program mode with center focusing with small frame size (S410 didn't have this problem). It would either not focus at all or claim it focused producing an image that is visibly out of focus. I had many flowers that 300 HS would refuse to focus on while S410 focused just fine.5. Noticeable chromatic aberrations in high contrast photos: anything bright will have an aura around it.6. Noticeable barrel distortion at widest angle: don't photograph people unless they are in the center of the shot.7. It tends to overexpose outdoor pictures.8. It likes to set aperture to f/8.0 (and sometimes above) instead of staying at f/2.7. This adds to image softness.What I do like:1. It's small and light.2. It shoots surprisingly good movies.3. It performs reasonably well under low light conditions (CMOS sensor vs. CCD in S410).I use mine in Program mode only, center focus, with sharpness tuned all the way up.""
"20111024","5.0","An amazing small camera","I bought this on Amazon because I read a bunch of reviews on other websites (cnet, ect.) and they all recommend it. I've had many digital cameras, fujifilm 4800 (from 2001),  this is my 3rd canon elph. the first was a 6mp 630s (sold long ago) and it was very good. I then bought the canon 790IS which is very good too (still have it), I then bought a samsung NV24 because it was basically the first point and shoot with HD video (720p), Then I got this last week and played around and I've come to the conclusion this is an AMAZING tiny camera. The picture quality for a small camera is incredible (12.1 MP). I have to say the outdoor pictures can almost rival my Canon 40D and Rebel T2i at low ISO. Video is very good too. The 1080p is excellent (even though it is only 24 fps) This is the point and shoot to get if you want the best out there for under $200.""

"20111024","3.0","decent camera but I would not recommend it, especially for the money!","LIKES:  1) Good image quality, very neutral color and smooth, records HD video with zoom.  2) Extremely compact.  3) User friendly and logically placed controls - such as the quick 1-touch video and the slide lever to switch the program/auto mode.  4) Brisk, quick operation such as the start up and shot-to-shot times.  5) Bright LCD visible even under the bright sunlight.  6) Decent battery life.DISLIKES:  1) The LCD is very low in resolution, looks like it's from 2003. Many pictures looked sharp on the LCD even when zoomed in, but they were blurry on the computer screen.  I do not have this problem with my similarly priced Sony WX9 which has a super high resolution LCD.  2) Rounded, curved, bubbly design maybe cute but it is slippery in the hand, increasing the chance of you dropping it. Also it will not stand upright easily, it is very tippy.  Which means if you set it on top of something to snap a timed picture or a night shot, there is good chance it will tip over, drop, and get heavily damaged.  3) All images are VERY SOFT even at the finest compression setting. There is no way to crank up the sharpness inside the camera. Expect to use software to crank up the sharpness on EVERY image  you decide to keep, which is a tedious and time-consuming task.  4) The HD video is limited to only 10 minutes which is stupid and just short enough to piss you off. On the Sony WX9 recording time is limited as well, but at 29 minutes, it is decent and just  long enough to be satisfying because usually the battery will expire before the cut off time. It also gobbles up a HUGE amount of memory as well!  5) Battery cover looks and feels EXTREMELY flimsy. Opening the cover shuts off the camera, which means hot swapping memory cards is not possible. It takes quite a bit of force with your thumb  to close the slippery cover, and it feels very unrefined, coarse and cheap with no positive tactile sensation at all. It also feels like it's going to break any minute which is annoying.""

"20111017","2.0","Video is a downgrade from older models","This is my fourth Canon point and shoot camera, and the first time I am disappointed. One of the reasons I use my camera is to shoot some short videos at concerts. Each generation of Canon camera has been better than the previous one, until now.The biggest failure is that video is handled via a button, and not a setting. That means focusing is no longer an option. In a concert setting, with flashing lights and so much movement, the camera does a poor job of auto-focusing, leaving you with bad results.On top of that, the microphone seems to be of worse quality than previous models.Yes, we can zoom in now (a welcome feature) but if the video starts out blurry, zooming makes things worse. You need to stop filming and try again.And finally, the location of the button is hard to push, so most video start out shaky, because pushing the button moves the camera.Aside from the video mode, there has been a bad change in the camera mode. 'Micro' is not handled the same as it was before, and especially in Auto mode, this camera always defaults to Micro before focusing on what's actually happening. So if you want to quickly pull out the camera and take a shot...don't. It will be in micro mode for whatever reason and takes a second to realize that you're trying to take a landscape picture.""
"20111017","2.0","Very disappointed","Well I bought one of these on sale at Staples since they had a 20% off all Canon non-DSLRs. I wanted this to replace my old Canon SD 1300 that someone stole. This Elph 300 HS looks really nice, great feel, nice LCD in the back and takes great photos outside during the day. However, indoors it's just a mess. I took this to a birthday party, set it to AUTO and took pics but the people's faces looked really yellowish/orange and weird. Its like the camera didn't know what type of light I was shooting in. My old one did just fine and it was an older model. If I started tweaking in the P-mode and set the lighting and the ISO and a bunch of settings then the photos came out almost normal. I shouldn't have to do all that. I just want a camera to take decent pictures and not make people's faces orange in AUTO mode. It also has a hard time focusing. Seriously, your pictures will mostly look blurry indoors. Which is weird since this is supposed to be a low light camera. It can't even focus right. Look at all the great reviews this has.....from OUTDOOR pictures. You'll be surprised when you start taking pics with this and it sucks. I ended up taking the camera back. Now I'm looking for the older models since they appear to take better pictures but don't do HD video. That's okay though because I want a camera for the pictures!! I hope this will help you avoid making a big mistake thinking newer is better.""
"20111016","5.0","Canon 300HS or 310HS","I thought I'd write this review for those of you who were considering either of these cameras. I did a lot of research as I always do when considering purchasing anything and this was no exception. After selling my Canon 40d, I wanted a simpler camera that I could take everywhere. I boiled it down between the 300, 310 and 510. I pretty much crossed off the 510 after seeing it had only an f3.4 lens coupled with the potential short battery life with the touch screen and the fact that someone said 'this is not like your iPhone screen'. So it was between the 300 and 310. I bought the black 300 that a major yellow tag big box store had in a package with an battery, case and card for a great price. After getting it home and doing a little follow up research regarding possible issues of these that were made in China, I found that mine was made in China so I went back and bought a red one made in Japan. So far so good. And I love the red over the black. I couldn't get used to the texture on the black one plus after seeing how bad the floor model look of the black one, I could just imagine how bad mine would be after continued use.So after using it for a week and loving it, I had the chance to check out the 310 in person when it arrived in the stores and decide if I should return the 300 or not and get the 310. The screen was bigger on the 310 and of slightly better quality but what made the final decision for me on which camera to keep was the placement and moreover the size of the menu and auto/program buttons on the side. Why they did this I have NO idea. If you have fingers bigger than that of a 5 year old then good luck manipulating the switches; especially the top one (I think it's the auto mode one). That alone sealed the deal. As I mentioned in a comment to one of the reviews on the 310, I would have to carry a paper clip or toothpick with me at all times to flip that switch--and I have narrow fingers. So all in all I am VERY happy with the 300 and love the many features it has. I was too much of a pixel peeper and that's why I bought the 40d but after hardly using it and taking so-so photos because I was not too savvy with it, I just gave up and sold it. I wanted a pocket camera that took good pictures that was easy enough for my wife to use and small enough to take anywhere. I found it in the Canon 300HS. No regrets!""

My photos have little noise at higher ISO settings.  As a side note, I read a review of the Canon ELPH 100  on dcresource (DCPR) site.  He said Continuous Mode activates the OIS system as soon as you halfway press the shutter release, which helps to compose the photos w/o camera shake.  The 'shoot only' option doesn't turn it on until the photo is actually taken, which improves the performance of the OIS sytem.  I'm sure this applies to the ELPH 300 also.""

"20111005","4.0","Great camera with a slight quirk","Bought this camera for a recent vacation trip, and it worked quite well.  Found that some pictures taken without the flash in low light conditions actually came out a great deal better than when using the flash.  Not sure how it works that way, but definitely a plus.  Less use of the flash means more battery time.  The fully charged Canon battery would last for about 250 pictures before needing replacing.For those who have had problems with the lens shutters not closing completely, here is your probable problem and solution, as I encountered the same issue.  The metal that covers the lens shutter assembly is very thin, and very easily bent.  If the camera is set face down on a non-flat surface, or pushed up against something, it could easily tweak the metal lens cover.  When the lens shutters on my camera suddenly stopped closing completely, I took a closer look at the camera.  With the camera on, and looking down at the lens from the top of the camera, I could see that the metal covering the lens shutter assembly was slightly pushed in.  This was causing the lens shutters to catch, and not close completely.What I did was to grab a miniature flathead screwdriver, and carefully slide it between the lens and the metal cover.  Do not slide the screwdriver head across the lens, as this could scratch the lens.  With a minimal amount of upward pressure, I was able to straighten out the bent section of the metal.  Do NOT leverage the screwdriver against the lens, as this could scratch it as well.  Just gently lift the screwdriver with a slight pressure applied.  Since doing this quick and easy fix, I have had absolutely no problem with the lens shutters, and both repeatedly close completely.It took a few minutes to get used to how the camera functions were laid out in the menu, but once accustomed, making changes is quick and easy.  Pictures came out great, focusing happens quite quickly.  If Canon would use a slightly thicker metal over the lens assembly, I think that that would resolve many of the lens shutter issues, and they would have many more happy customers.In spite of this one quirk, I am very happy with this camera, and would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends and family.""
"20111005","5.0","I love this camera!","The Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS 12.1 MP Digital Camera (Black) is a nice and user friendly camera with great options and great image quality.  I opened the box and charge the battery for 30 min and have used the camera so far for about 1000 photos.  I use it for my work (I am a teacher) and for my business, as I provide direct feedback to clients and students with what we do.  It is definitely worth the money and I used to use the Canon 90S PowerShot before, but a student dropped it and broke it so this replacement camera works great for what I need it for.  Yet, the Canon 90S PowerShot was great, but not easy to use for students as the Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS 12.1 MP Digital Camera (Black). In essence, a great purchase.""
"20111004","5.0","An outstanding little camera!!!","I bought this camera as a replacement for a Sealife Mini II underwater camera I had returned. I did my homework and researched different models, read all the reviews and decided on the 300 HS. I haven't been disappointed. This camera takes beautiful photos and high definition video and is packed with all the same features I have on my higher priced Canon Powershot SX130IS. I also bought the optional WP-DC41 underwater housing for the 300 HS and tried it out on a recent dive trip to Roatan. Over the course of a week and about 14 dives, the camera performed flawlessly. And the photo and video quality remained outstanding, even at depths reaching 120 feet!I highly recommend this camera!""

The menus are easy to navigate and the auto setting usually takes a good picture though I really enjoy switching over to manual and playing with all those settings. Definitely a great buy and this camera will last quite a while.""

"20110930","3.0","great little camera but....","The camera is perfect for on-the-go point and shoot photography, good quality images, fairly rapid shutter response, wide range of options, although the menu is a bit cumbersome. Also wish there was a better way to choose ISO/shutter speed/ aperture combinations for special situations. 'Kids and pets' doesn't quite cover it.One big problem - after just 2 and 1/2 months usage, the retracting lens cover stopped working. When I turn the camera on, it retracts just slightly, requiring me to manually push the curtain back. Then when I turn it off, the cover does not fully close over the lens, allowing dust and particles to possibly scratch the lens or further interfere with the mechanism of the curtain. I'm going to take it to an authorized Canon dealer to see what if anything can be done about this.""

From one who pre-dates television, this little gem of miniaturization is nothing short of miraculous.  It takes excellent pictures, has all the features most folks might ask for, and rides along easily in your pocket when not in use.  The only significant improvement that I can suggest would be an optical viewer for use in bright sunlight.  For those who might be concerned about protection for the viewing screen, there a number of inexpensive fabric cases on the market that do not add much bulk.

"20110926","1.0","Not worth the price","In 3 months, the camera failed twice, had to be replaced once and repaired once. Automatic mode takes up to 4 seconds to snap a picture after the trigger is pressed. Microphones are on top of the case where fingers cover them while doing video. When I sent my BLACK camera back for the first replacement, the Canon service center returned a SILVER one and never returned the battery that was with the camera. Impossible to see the subject in the view screen in daylight and now viewfinder. The lens barrel is very flimsy and easily damaged. One slight pressure on the front creased the thin metal and jammed the protective lens shutters. NOT WORTH BUYING.""

It's well built and takes good quality photos.  I'll mention one item that has been commented on in other reviews: the one I bought as a gift was silver.  It looks nice and the external paint surface is smooth.  The one I bought for myself is black.  It looks classic, but the paint surface is rough - kind of like fine grain sandpaper.  I wasn't sure I would like it, but after using it, I realize I like it better than the smooth paint surface.  The rough surface provides some gripiness that makes the camera feel firmer in your hands.  If you like smooth, get silver.  If you like rough, get black.  Not sure whether the red one is smooth or rough.""

"20110923","5.0","This an excellent little, inexpensive camera that is good at almost everything","UPDATE AT BOTTOM...This is an excellent little camera in reference to what it is, a very small point and shoot, with very good picture, and HD video capabilities.  I am not comparing this to a 2700.00 Canon 5D Mark II, and neither should you.I have another inexpensive, HD video camera, the Sanyo CG20( a dedicated video camera) and the Canon blows it away in both High Def video, and still photography.You can consider me a semi pro, in reference to still photography, and I can tell you the still images that this little camera produces, are quite good.  Again, not comparing it to a DSLR.The camera is very small and light, and will make an excellent backpacking camera.  I haven't been taking a lot of still images, because I didn't want to pack one of my DSLRs, and carry an extra 5 or 6 lbs, plus the hassle of trying to fit it into an already over stuffed pack(40lbs), and then unpack it quickly, when a deer, or bear or something steps across the trail.Sound:This camera has two little stereo microphones, and the audio quality is quite good when it is in your hand. I haven't tried it on a tripod yet, and will update this review when I do.  After recording a video, and upon playback you can barely hear the audio in the field, but don't worry, it sounds fine when you play it back on your computer.Video Quality:Excellent for the cost and size of this camera, and quite good in general.  Good color balance, good exposure(when using Exposure Compensation) and good definition, and detailPhoto Quality:Again very good in the point and shoot realm, and good in general across the board, taking all camera styles into account.  I have 2 DSLRs for reference, and taking those into account, this is very good for what it is.Controls:Very good for a point and shoot.  It has a dedicated video recording button that works well, with the exception that when you push it upon stopping video, you will get a little shimey in the very last segment of your video.  Not a big deal, just trim it out.Advanced video, and Photo control:There are only two things this camera is missing as far as advanced controls.  One is manual focus capabilities, and the other is manual shutter capabilities for still photos.  With those two added, or even manual focus added, this would blow me away.Shutter Lag:From the reviews I read before hand, if you prefocus(push the shutter button down half way) it is one of the fastest point and shoot cameras, if you don't(and just push the button when you want to take a picture) it is one of the slowest...  .1 second if you prefocus, and .49 seconds if you don't.  In my experience, the camera definitely has some lag, but I expected this, and it isn't an issue for me.  It is MUCH faster than my mother in-laws older Sony, which has lag to a point that it is an issue.  I think advanced focusing algorithms slow the process down. I recommend that if you have the camera, try prefocusing, while you are waiting for the shot.Important outputs:Of course, USB to download to the computer, and a mini HDMI port to play directly on your High Def television.The not so nice:As I said, lack of manual focus, a slight tendency to overexpose(easily fixed with exposure compensation through the dedicated button), and you can barely hear the sound track when you play back videos in the field.For the cost, I bet this is one of the very best!  I am very pleased!For samples of video, and still pictures, go to my website at markdfellows. c o m and look at the very bottom of the 'Mark's Hiking page' link.A great camera!UPDATE AT OF OCTOBER 7TH, 2011:I wrote Canon an email and despite what the manual says about 'Exposure Shift' in movie mode, there is no manual settings for this.  Must be something the camera does internally.I found out that putting the camera in 'Aquarium, or Underwater mode'(the mode with a fish)gives you really vibrant, well saturated colors with good highlights, so try using that mode, for vibrant videos.  Be warned though, it can trash skin tones.I have just started playing around with aspect ratios, which you can set in this camera from 1:1 to 16:9(wide screen) which should give me hours of enjoyment.  I think I am going to try shooting in 16:9 mode.  I like the look.I definitely recommend you experiment with all the modes, it gives you some nice options, and in my case, led to me finding out that if I use that mode with the fish as the indicator, you will have well saturated colors and better highlights.  I have also tried a low light video with just a campfire that I am pretty pleased with the results.More videos are available by going to youtube, and typing in 'themarkfellows2' in the search field.  I hope this helps!  Good luck!""

"20110919","5.0","Great upgrade from our old Digital Camers","Takes great photos & videos.  We'd recently brought a new puppy home with us who moves faster than we can get a picture of her that's not blurred.  The video & software that come with this model are outstanding.  I can now take a video of her and with the software that came with the camera freeze frames, save individual frames, print them out, email, download to our ipod, etc.  Gave it only 3 stars on Design layout ... the lower right corner on the back of the camera has so many setting buttons that I continue to accidentally touch while pointing & shooting to take a picture.  It's annoying, but since everything else is a 5 STAR I can learn to live with it.Over the weekend I used this camera to take photos of an art exhibit ... it was hosted in a showroom of a blown glass business that specializes in high-end hand blown glass pendants lights, so needless to say the setting although it was an evening event & had no natural light, the photos turned out wonderful.

After owning Canon SD870 for 5 years, carrying it to beaches, hiking, etc. I found it to be a bit bulky and wanted something that can shoot HD video for my trip to South America and also something smaller. I was really happy with the picture quality and videos, carried the camera in my pocket (in a case) all the time. Suddenly I saw that the shutter cover is not opening any more and I had to use my hand to open/close it for the whole duration of my trip (it was damaged maybe 10 days into my trip, no obvious hit that I felt that could damage the camera). After I returned, Canon estimated the damage to be $170. Needles, to say, I am not having it repaired and I seriously doubt I will continue buying Canon powershot cameras due to poor build quality. I treated it with care, but having a small portable camera that you have to put in a big protective case in order to avoid damage due to normal handling beats the purpose of the small form factor.""

This time I had to push the lens cover open with my finger because half of it stayed shut when I turned on the camera. So, I sent that back again for another factory reconditioned camera which I ended up selling it 50 dollars less then I originally paid.

It took some reading to get to know how to use some of the features, but it is still much simpler to use than many cameras. It is very small, but produces excellent results.

However, I am seriously considering getting one of these to replace those in most situations.""
"20110912","5.0","Bought it for myself...twice!","I bought this camera back in april and again today.  2 weeks ago my family was on vacation and when walking down to the lake, I began to fall.  I had to let something go and my options were: my daughter or this camera.  So I let the camera go...flying into the lake. :( luckily, I was able to retrieve all the photos off the card but the camera was dead.  Note: water and sand do NOT mix well with this camera. :)~Anyway, this is my 3rd canon and I will never buy another brand for my point-n-shoot.  It is the best for low light (indoors) and moving subjects (my kids).  Add in the new HD video and the slow motion (son playing t-ball for the first time; daughter walking for the first time) and this camera is THE camera for parents!!  You just can't get everything canon gives you for this price.I almost upgraded to the 500 this round...but $50 wasn't quite worth it to me for the touch-screen (though that sounds like a great feature...the way our phones are now).  The new video feature that takes 4 seconds around each of your photos and creates an automatic 'day' slideshow for you sounds pretty cool but I'm already running low on space on my card since I don't instantly transfer pics to my computer.Also, the battery length was getting listed as 'con' for that camera (I'm assuming because of the touch screen) and that is one thing I love about this camera.  I can take photos on and off all day for over a week before I am reminded 'oh ya, remember to charge the battery before our trip this weekend.'  But I have never had a fully-charged battery fail me on an entire weekend long trip.This is one amazing camera in the tiniest package yet.  And if you get the black one, the exterior has a nice, rugged texture.I would recommend this for any family member or friend...and you know I love it when I spend another $200 for the exact same camera less than 5 months later.  It just can't be beat!""
"20120427","1.0","not up to Canon's standards","A real disappointment, and our family owns four Canons.  This one, seemingly the most sophisticated, is thrown by tricky light situations.  My son and I have both tried various options, from adjusting the white balance to the ISO level to shifting between auto and program.  Too many pictures are simply washed out.  My wife's simpler Canon never fails in low light conditions, but mine does.  It always involves experimentation, and grandchildren don't have that much patience.  Movies seem great.  I've had some problems with the lens cover too.  Sadly, I've ended up going back to my four-year old Lumix.""

I use it a lot for the HD video too. The macro feature is nice too. On my old Canon, I would have to manually set it to the macro setting to get close-up shots, but this one does it automatically.

But this little camera is more than just portable, it takes some excellent shots.  It has about 200 test shots on it now of panoramas, wildlife and some semi macro shots.  I must admit my camera elitism is suffering as this little thing has taken amazing shots.  As with any of these small sensor and lens cameras it does suffer in the extremes of its capabilities like fast movement and low light.  Even in those conditions it is surprisingly sharp and certainly acceptable for the price.  One thing I always do with cameras is mess with the controls before I read the manual to see how intuitive they are.  This is the easiest to operate camera I can recall.  The controls and menus just make sense.  I would think even without much photography background you could master these quickly.  Latter reading the manual in detail I was pleasantly surprised to see a lack of overly sophisticated controls on a simple camera.  Just enough flexibility to let you use the camera to its limits.I don't take many flash shots or use the video feature other than to test them out.  Both seemed very good but again that is not my area of expertise.Minor thing of note.  This camera is not small it is tiny.  If you have large fingers the controls can be a little tough to avoid hitting multiple controls at once but no big deal.Additional plus-  my black one has a textured, rough finish.  I love this.  Much easier to grip and none of that hockey puck problem on slick services.In summary- for the $149 I paid this is a great second camera, outdoor camera or even a first camera if you don't have extreme demands.""
"20120424","1.0","Awful for what I use it for","I bought this camera due to its ability to work in low light, and it's AP Tracking feature. I use this camera to take pictures of my pets, mostly reptiles. I can't stand that even in program mode, the F stop is fully automatic from what I can tell. This has been a problem with canon powershot cameras for years. Most of the time the camera gets the color or lighting wrong, and the pictures are somewhat clear, but not crisp or detailed. That auto F-stop always gets it wrong, if you want a side-view of whatever you're shooting, expect it to be blurry. Sad to say, I much preferred the Powershot A560 to this.UPDATE: I have returned the camera. It seems mine was defective, the lens had discolored spots and looked foggy on the inside as if humidity got to it. Seeing as I took excellent care of the camera while I had it (and I live in a very dry area,) it seems it was done before I received it. I will not try purchasing this camera again. Maybe I will try Panasonic Lumix series cameras from now on.""

I had previously been using a Sony Cybershot (which is nice too) but I wanted to upgrade to more MP's and I was looking for a sleeker, smaller camera. I bought the camera in black and it has a rougher texture making it easier to keep your grip on it. It fit in my small purse perfectly and I've had nothing but compliments on the awesome photos it took. Great color and clarity! I also took a few short video clips which was fun and easy ... you don't have to switch settings, just push the video button! This camera has way more settings/functions than I will ever use but is fun if you want to experiment. It really can't be any easier to use if you just want to point and click! I was down there for 5 days/6 nights and only had to charge my battery once. I used the 'auto' settings most of the time and it almost always chose the right setting for the picture. Only a couple of times did I have to turn the flash off to get a better picture. You'll LOVE this camera!!""

"20120415","3.0","LCD Image Brightness and Flash Too Bright","After reading most of the reviews, I decided that this would be a great gift for my sisters birthday. The price was affordable and there did not seem to be much of a huge difference upgrading to the newer models. In addition, I was looking for a simple point and shoot camera that would take quick shots, to avoid that 'oh please take that damn shot' moment, as you wait. The specs state 1.5 seconds, which is very respectable... until you use the flash. More on this below.This camera is very compact and easy to store in your pocket. The video is pretty clear and easy to record. The buttons are located in good locations and the color Red was very well received, making it easy to locate.Now for the problems:1) IMAGE BRIGHTNESS ON LCD SCREEN: The major problem, at least with the camera we received, is that the image brightness displayed on the screen does not match to those you will see on your computer. Of course, this is not a surprise, since the lcd on the camera only shows a small amount of pixels but the problem is not the clarity or color, but that of brightness. Photo's taken in low light situations with no flash will look bright enough on the camera's display but once you transfer to your computer, they are very completely dark and extremely grainy. Likewise, photo's taken with a flash look washed out on the screen but once transferred, look not as bright. Decreasing the screen brightness on the camera did nothing to elevate this issue. Defective screen?2) FLASH TOO BRIGHT:The flash is too bright and not controllable in either automatic or manual modes. This results in photo's that look too flash exposed and too many highlights in the face. Luckily, if the ISO setting is low enough, the photo's can be corrected in any photo editing software.3) AUTO ISO TOO HIGH & GRAINY: Although automatic mode is indeed handy for people who do not want to or know how to adjust settings. The flaw here is that the Auto mode decides which ISO setting to use, which in most situations is exceptionally high (i.e ISO 400 with Flash, ISO 1600 without). The higher the ISO the more grainy the images will be and the less pixel brightness information you have for photo retouching or correcting.The fix for this is to use manual mode and change the auto ISO to a value of 100 or 200. Make sure that your flash is set to auto or OFF, and this should result in a much better quality looking image with no pixel grain. When the flash goes off, you might get an overexposed image that is too bright, but since you have a lot of pixel information, you will most likely be able to adjust that in any photo editing software.4) TOO SLOW WITH FLASH: Although photo's taken without a flash are taken at an impressive 1.5 seconds, once you include the flash, that time dramatically increases to 3-4 seconds, where your models have to wait patiently with there frozen smiles that turn to grins.IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED (likely by purchasing another model):1) ISO Max, this way you can guarantee that the camera won't select such a high setting of ISO 1600. ISO 400 should really be the high limit.2) Flash brightness control. This would eliminate the need to correct for this in a photo editor. Auto Flash brightness based on ISO would be ideal.3) Ability to reuse last auto setting for next photo. This way, the camera does not need to recalculate focus, red eye, settings, etc all over again.4) An LCD that displays correct brightness of photo's taken (if my camera is not a defect).NOTE: In my defense, I should have been more aware that taking photo's in low lighting would result in a high AUTO ISO setting of 1600. I actually didn't notice that ISO until the day after. However, when I viewed this through the camera's lcd screen, they looked quite bright (even the darks were bright enough) and overexposed when using a Flash. Being very impressed with the low lighting photo's, I decided to avoid using the flash for more than half the photo's..... BIG MISTAKE.""
"20120415","3.0","Check compatibility","We have had our camera for about 5 months.  I have been getting an error 32 message for at least 2 months.  The camera shuts down and needs to be restarted.  Also, the camera cannot be recognized on my iMac which is running OS 10.4.11 (Tiger).  I need to upgrade to at least 10.5 (which means I'll lose Photoshop 7).  The camera did work with iPhoto, but does not appear on the computer's desktop, just in iPhoto's window.  However, it recently quit working with iPhoto.  The photos seem good, but I have had so many problems with just getting the photos off the camera, it is hard to say.  Will update the review after I contact Canon about the error message.""
"20110911","3.0","would not buy it for myself","I bought this camera as a gift, as a gift this camera might be ok, but I would not buy it for myself. I realize that this camera is only $200 dollars but image sharpness is a huge problem for this camera. image color quality is OK, nothing to be excited about.  Most things about this camera i can tolerate because this camera is so cheap, but I did like video quality. of course this is not a camcorder so zooming and moving with the camera is not advisable but i thought that this camera produces better video than photos.""
"20110909","4.0","Almost awesome","The video recording is stunning; better than expected. The wide lens is wonderful, the size and weight are great. The controls are simple, the battery life, screen, and zoom are all good. The speed of the camera, especially when taking multiple shots consecutively, keeps up with fast, demanding subjects. The tracking AF is clever, as is the face detection AiAF.The paint chips easily (normal, I'll guess), but that's not a real issue. The issue for me is the macro mode Ai.  Canon's AF intelligence flies out the window when switched to macro. Shots can still be composed manually by focussing the macro subject in the center of the frame, then framing the shot before pressing the shutter down the rest of the way. That's not the way my past Canon Powershots have worked, and it's enough to make sure I sent this one right back.If you don't use macro: get this camera. It's wonderful in almost every other way. If you do use macro: look at other cameras. I've owned several other PowerShots and will still swear by them.""

"20110909","4.0","small, lightweight, easy point and shoot camera","Like advertised and some other reviews say, this camera is very easy to use in its automatic mode.  I have gone from taking landscape pictures to portraits to closeup of flowers and they all turn out great without ever pressing any buttons.  Just aim, focus, and shoot.  If it focuses on the wrong thing, just try again and it usually gets what I'm trying to focus on for the shot.  The movies it makes are really nice compared to my last camera (5 years old).  Plays great on my new laptop.Some negative points: I can't figure out how to force the flash yet (had it one month).  People on the edge of the photo are distorted (slight horizontal stretch of the image).  I'm not sure why that should be.  All my other cameras didn't have that issue.  The movies don't play well on older computers - although I have the movie setting on highest quality full HD, so that is understandable.  These are fairly minor negatives in my opinion.Other than that, nice basic versatile camera that goes along almost anywhere.  Good deal for $230.""
"20110909","5.0","Great pocket camera","This is a great camera for your pocket or purse. Smaller than a phone camera with 10 times the picture quality.

"20110908","5.0","No need to trade in your SD780.","Although the Elph 300 claims to be 'the world's thinnest camera,' that's now, not a couple of years ago when Canon released the SD780.  The latter camera is thinner, narrower, shallower in all its exterior dimensions and marginally lighter in weight.  It's also boasts a 12.1 mp lens and HD video.On the plus side, the new Elph has a wider-angle lens and stereo sound (of questionable superiority over monaural sound when the recording mic is necessarily squeezed onto a sound stage this small).In short, unless your 780 is broken, it would seem pointless to replace it with this point and shoot.  Should you plan to pick up an Elph 300, you may wish to wait until the end of the month.  One of Amazon's competitors is promising to reduce its price for the camera, so it remains to be seen how Amazon will respond.""
"20110907","5.0","ELPH 300","This is an amazing little camera. It is a power house in a small package. Low light performance is simply amazing. Regretfully I had a few sequences of pictures which were very dark in situations which should have been perfect. In discussing the problem with Canon, I was encouraged to send the camera back for evaluation. Later, I received recall notice from Amazon saying that the memory card manufacturer was experiencing problems with their product storing large files. Even though my memory card was not in the affected serial number sequence, I suspect the problem with the Elph 300 may be caused by something associated with the memory card. This is a great little camera and I am confident Canon will resolve the issue I experienced.""

I had a Canon for a while that I ended up breaking by dropping. The shutter stopped working. So, then I got a Sony, which is having problems with the controls. For some reason I never really got into the Sony, not that there was any wrong with it. I guess I just liked my first camera.

Zoom while recording a video happens slowly... thus giving a gradual zooming in effect to the video. Worth every penny one spends on this. Auto mode does a great job. P fucntion is useful especially in bright sun light conditions.Night shoot is a little dicey despite the advertisement. It is ok... as is the case with many point and shoots.

"20110902","2.0","Don't like the image quality","I really don't understand why people seem to rave about this camera. I bought this and returned it a couple weeks later; I found the image quality to not be very good, images (even taken outside in good light) were noisy, washed out looking, bad colors, not sharp. It would really be great to be able to buy a compact, pocketable camera that takes good photos; you can't expect dSLR quality, but hopefully decent, acceptable quality. Unfortunately, I don't think this is possible. Basically, from my investigations, the key ingredient to getting good photo quality is to have a large sensor (e.g. read here: [...]). And in considering previous cameras I have owned and liked the photo quality of (e.g. Kodak V1073, Kodak C875, HP PhotoSmart 945), they all had larger than average sensors (not dSLR sized, but bigger than the 1/2'3 that is used on this camera and many other compact cameras and it made a noticeable difference in quality to me). Anyway, I still don't really want to have to buy a huge dSLR and have to lug it around. There are some intermediate level cameras that have large sensors but aren't so big as dSLRS (but bigger than compacts like this one). For example, the Sony NEX line looks promising. Also, the Samsung NX100 looks good too (and seems very reasonably priced). You can easily find the image sensor size of cameras at the web site dpreview.Another, separate gripe I had about this camera is that, while you can take panoramic photos (i.e. take multiple snapshots and have them stitched together into a larger panorama photo), the stitching is NOT done in the camera --- you have to upload the separate photos to your computer and use an external piece of software to do the stitching. What a hassle! Digicams have been doing in-camera stitching of panoramas for years, why can't this camera?Also note that while you can take full HD video with this, it is only 24 frames per second and you are limited to about a max of 10 minutes per clip. By contrast the Sony DSC-WX9 (which I also was considering) can take 60 frames per second full HD video and there is no time limit. If you must have a pocketable camera like this, I would recommend the Sony DSC-WX9 over this one.""
"20110901","5.0","Excellent, small camera; great value. Zooms in video.","This is a very well-designed camera. Received the packaged promptly as described by Amazon.com.The camera has a mild 'gritty' feel to it (to aid in grip); this is well-documented by fellow reviewers on this page.The picture quality is top-notch. The video quality is fascinating, especially when viewing with HDMI cable on our LED TV (the side port has a mini-HDMI out, as well as the mini-USB for communication w/ your computer). You are also able to zoom while in video mode, which sets the 300hs apart from it's friend the 100hs.The LCD and buttons in the rear-panel are intuitive, as is the selection menu for the various aspects of camera control.The menu and features are similar to other Canon camera products.The camera is small and neatly packed; My hands are above-average sized and the camera's size is about 1/3 of my hand. Therefore, it takes a a few shots to get used to not getting your fingers in the way of the flash, lens and microphone.  The microphone is located on the top panel, with two small holes.One strategy of getting to know the camera prior to your purchase is to go to a local electronics store and seeing the camera (or a similar one) first hand.As with any camera or electronic purchase, it's best to find one that fits your needs.Remember this camera will take high-quality pictures and videos, which will translate to increased power consumption (consider one or two back-up batteries (size/type: NB-4L) and mandate high-capacity memory cards.Our fellow reviewers have gone into much greater depth and all have done a fantastic job at thorough explanation.I hope this review serves as a validation to the quality and value of the Canon ELPH 300hs.

"20110831","5.0","AWESOME camera for ur money!","This is the BEST point & shoot I've had! The pictures are very crisp & clear! Every picture I take comes out great!  It has really neat settings like color swap & accent, toy camera mode, mini mode, & the high burst mode is pretty sweet! The high burst mode only takes pics that are 3mp but its still clear enuf for a good pic!  The HD movie mode is very awesome! everything is very crisp n clear! even at night!  The movie has its own button for convience which is pretty handy so i dont have to keep pressing buttons trying to find it.  The only thing ive had problems with is the macro mode.  Sometimes it doesnt focus very good, but i think its bc im too close to the subject.  Other than that i havent had any  problems yet, ive had it for about a month now.  I read somewhere that the camera is made in China & Japan, but the one from China breaks more, not for sure about that but i got the one from Japan!  I also got a steal on this camera! $199 when amazon was having a sale! I took some pics n put them in with the other pics to give u an idea of how much this little camera has to offer.  Sometimes if ur taking a video the battery will blink but wen u stop recording & switch to camera mode it says u have 2 bars left, found that kinda weird, but the batt can die on u.  The only flaw is the new cameras dont have a view finder! So when ur out in the bright sun the screen is useless & ur basically flying blind when taking a pic! I was debating on this one or the 100 hs, but i got this one cuz the navigation buttons seems easier than the 100, the 100 didnt have the separate video button.

"20110829","4.0","Excellent slim compact for when the SLR is not with you.","I enjoy my Canon 40D SLR, but wanted something that is never far from me for the shots I'd otherwise miss.My key requirements:1. Something to fit in the pocket, good build and reliable brand.2. Good quality pictures, for a compact, but didn't need to compete with SLR quality. Not keen on supersaturation or over-sharpening.3. At least 28mm wide angle, with zoom of 4x or more. f2.8 or better is also good.4. Flash available, but lower-light capability is a plus and something I generally prefer.5. Prepared to go without RAW, aperture/speed priority in order to keep the cost and size down. Exposure compensation is needed though.6. Video capability, with zoom and continuous focus available while shooting.7. The ergonomics need to be good. Core functionality done well trumps number of features.So after much reading and some handling, the Canon ELPH 300HS seemed to be the sweet spot and I bought one in June. Two months later, and 1,200 photos have confirmed that it meets these criteria without excessive expense. I like the 24mm wide angle and 5x zoom, and it has better than expected capability in low light - presumably helped by them keeping to 12MP - a good move. Videos are very nice to watch, surprisingly good really, and it's a great fit for the pocket.I like the coarser feel of the black model rather than the smooth metal silver version - it's a personal preference but I feel less likely to drop it as I don't have a strap attached. The screen is good, even at 2.7' and with mediocre eyes.The battery lasts a reasonable time, but unfortunately seems to give only a dozen or so shots warning before it stops. Have a spare available.I bought a small soft rooCASE Neoprene Sleeve (Grey) Carrying Case for it and its very satisfactory. It has a side pocket for the spare battery but that does make it a bit bulkier so I now leave it out. Bit of a shame but want to keep things slim so I do carry it.Yes, I could spend more and get a larger sensor, a bigger zoom, RAW, more control, etc., but size starts increasing and the whole idea was to have it with me without having to think about bulk play-offs every time you go out. It can't match my SLR's quality, but the pictures sure beat opportunities missed by having no camera (or just phone camera) there at all. It's not perfect, but quality and feel are good, it's well set out, and I expect this will do as my little camera for a good number of years.""

"20110827","3.0","Love this camera except....","I bought this camera to replace a Fujifilm f100 finepix camera that I loved after doing a lot of comparison reading on different models.I seldom ever give any credence to people who write a review after only having the camera for a couple of days, especially when they actually admit in writing that they haven't even read the user's manual yet, so I waited to write my review after using the camera for about a month, and approximately 300 pictures taken in different circumstances.All in all, I am very happy with the camera, its features as advertised, the feel of the camera, the ease of using it in quick situations since I use it mostly while I'm in Tijuana, so at times, I have to be quick and quiet when I take pictures, or else things can go from bad to worse in a tick of a second.The only complaint that I have is that the little protective shutter that covers the lens when the camera is shut off, now does not fully open when I turn on the camera, so what I now have to do is to GENTLY touch the little retractable protective shutters to get them to fully open when the unit is powered up, or to fully close when I shut the unit off.I'll send it back for warranty work as soon as I get the information back from Canon on where they want me to send it, but for the price of the camera, and what it does with the many features that it has, I am happy with the camera with no regrets in buying it since this is my first Canon digital camera.Would I buy another Canon point and shoot camera over a Fujifilm camera?Well the jury is still out on that one at this time, but depending on how Canon takes care of the warranty repair (time, speed of getting the camera back to me, etc) on getting my camera back to working like it is designed to do, will go a long way on either making me a loyal Canon customer or chalking it up to experience and going back to Fujifilm where the finepix f550 EXR is looking really good to me.""
"20110827","5.0","Quickly became my favorite camera/pocket camcorder.","I purchased this camera about 6 months ago to take pictures and video of my 2 little girls.  I have a glutton of point-and-shoot cameras and pocket camcorders, however, this camera quickly became my favorite.  In fact I hardly use anything else and have gotten rid of all my pocket camcorders (flip mino, kodak Zi8 and playsport).  I would characterize myself as an amateur photographer and take mostly family pictures and videos.  To my eyes, the picture quality is very good and close to the quality of my Canon S95 (auto mode).  I actually prefer this camera to my S95 because it is more portable and a lot faster.  The S95 takes longer to start up and the lag between shots are longer, which is not advantages when you are trying to take pictures of kids.  It also has a dedicated video button making it as convenient as any pocket camcorder.  The features I enjoy most about the 300HS sre the wide angle lens and the HD video mode.  It captures great video with stereo sound.  The quality is definitely better than my Kodaks and Flip.  I also like the fact that with the wide angle lens I am able to capture more the action which comes in handy when filming clips of my daughters.Now for the cons: 1) Price.  At retail price it cost more than most point-and-shoots but I would say it is still a good value. If you are like me and like to take pictures and videos, it is worth the cost not to have to manage the battery, the memory and carry around multiple devices.  2) Heat. It does get a bit hot after 10 minutes of recording videos. I do take a lot of video clips so I am a bit concern about whether this will shorten the life of the camera.  3) Battery life.  It is decent if you are just taking pictures but if you are taking videos, you have to remember to charge it after each outing.I would recommend this camera for the casual photographer who is also likes to take short video clips.""
"20110827","5.0","overall a very good subcompact","I have not used the camera extensively but so far I think its a very nicely designed camera and takes very good pictures. I am often surprised how many times the auto flash does not chose to use a flash, when I would think it should, and the picture comes out great. Some nice touches, the sandy feeling of the paint, the record button for video (no having to switch to video mode), many cool picture modes, its just very easy to use. The thin size is just great. My only (minor) complaints are that the switching of modes is all done via a menu, which can be a bit of a pain. Instead of having some sort of dial with some of the modes you might want to bring up quickly (like high speed mode). And I have found that the digital zoom is hard to focus when you get toward the higher zoom. I realize that digital zooms are not historically great so I can't say its an issue, but have to mention, neither complaint I think warrants the dropping of any stars so I am sticking with 5. Overall I am very happy so far.""

The sand paper texture give good grip during photo/video capture.""
"20110823","4.0","Be careful if you are planning on putting it in your pocket (doesn't everybody?)","I really like this camera and love the texture on the black color. I would definately give this camera a 5-star rating if it wasn't for one problem... A few days after receiving this camera I placed it in my pocket and a few hours later took it out again to find the cover for the lens was not opening and closing properly when turned on. I quickly figured out that the metal housing around the lens was all bent up and dented. The metal around the lens (area where 'CANON ZOOM LENS 5x IS' is printed) and subsequent metal rings are made of very thin metal and are easily damaged if put into your pocket. I have been able to bend the metal back out so that the lens now opens and closes properly, but still looks all dented up. I previously owned the Canon Powershot 870 and always used to put it in my pocket (isn't that what these cameras are for?) and never had one problem with anything being damaged.""
"20110823","5.0","Cannon Elpf 300","I did a pretty extensive review before buying a new camera. We looked for a point and shoot without all the buttons to make it confusing.  We have shot about 300 pictures with this camera and are amazed by the picture quality!!!!  It is small, light and in the AUTO mode a truely point and shoot camera. It has a 5X zoom but will actually zoom to 20X, you just have to press the button down to let it focus longer (the picture quality isn't as good) but still allows you to get that long shot.  I purchased a logic case and extra battery for it for about $10 (well worth it). The fuctions for reviewing the photos, deleting are extremely easy to use.  VERY VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE !!!""
"20110822","5.0","Excellent point and shoot","This is my third PowerShot and it is the best I've ever owned.  Canon continues to have one of the easiest to use interfaces on the market.  What sets this camera apart is that it takes brilliant photos.  It especially thrives in low-light situations.  The zoom is impressive.  Just putting the whole thing on auto and shooting away produces excellent results.  I wish the battery lasted a little longer (shooting video seems to deplete it very quickly), but that's my only complaint for what is on the whole the best point-and-shoot camera I've ever owned.""
"20110822","2.0","Beautiful camera, terrible image quality","I am a huge fan of Canon, but am completely disappointed with this little camera.Pros:The Elph 300HS is very small, which makes it easy to take with you just about anywhere you go. The matte black finish is stylish and makes holding the camera very comfortable. As always, the menus on the Canon cameras are easy to navigate and get in and out of. The HD video capability of the camera is fantastic--it blows my HD Flip camera out of the water. It is a nice looking, easy to use camera.Cons:The auto-focus AI on this camera is the worst I have ever used, and is the reason for the 2 star rating. Even in full sunlight, with center-focus selected as the focus mode, the camera will rarely produce a crisp, well-focused image. The intelligent focusing modes are even worse, rarely detecting faces or relevant focal points. The battery life is also very poor. A fully charged battery will last about a day of hiking and photo taking. If you are traveling, don't forget your charger. Low expectations are a given for a point and shoot camera, but it should at least be able to focus properly.I have had several point and shoot digital cameras over the last decade or so, and this is bar far the least satisfying of them all.""
"20110822","2.0","Almost","Purchased this camera to replace an older Sony point-and-shoot. Own two Canon D-SLR cameras (500D and T2i) and have been impressed with the pictures from both cameras.Heard good things about Canon's ELPH 300 HS, liked the size and thought it would work out. Unfortunately the flash has a way of overpowering almost everything in a picture; even when forcing the flash for backlit situations, the resulting images look unnatural. Flash output is so bright, and there's no nuance just like (unlike both the older Sony and the newer T2i).We ended up sending this one back and opting instead for an SX230HS at almost 50% higher price point.[...][...]""

Pictures come out best with 'P' mode.  Set it to Vivid or Positive Film - I prefer the latter.  Positive Film only makes red, blue, green more attractive; whereas Vivid makes yellow too pronounced for me.  A user also commented that you can set exposure to -2/3.  I am trying -1/3 for now.  Having used the camera for ten days I am happy to give the camera a five-star.""

"20110820","5.0","Excellent for art and casual photography","This camera is beyond satisfactory for use as an art student and a casual photographer. I bought the camera primarily as a method of gathering photos for research and image references for art projects, but also as an everyday camera for taking pictures of friends and family. The camera's automatic settings will take excellent quality photographs in most conditions, and it has enough adjustable settings for more knowledgeable photographers to enhance the existing quality. The camera's small size makes it easy to transport anywhere. It also has lots of fun settings to play around with. My younger brother especially loves messing around with the 'super slow motion' video mode. All in all, a great product that delivers a lot of punch for the relatively low price.""

"20110820","5.0","Great compact camera","Purchased the camera for a trip to China.  I have owned a number of compact cameras and spent a lot of time researching and trying cameras before I purchased.  This camera is incredible.  For me, the most important feature is the end result - it's a point and shoot so how do the photos turn out on point and shoot mode?  Excellent.  Great color, great light balance and crisp focus.  Low light photos are particularly good.  It is easy to use, light weight and the battery lasts a phenomenally long time.  As a side note, the recharge on the battery is fast - less than 1/2 hour.  Great zoom and 'manual' features are intuitive and easy to use.  Here's the kicker I didn't expect.  The videos are fantastic. I never expected the quality out of this camera that you get.  I am selling my Sony HD handicam as a result.  I would recommend buying the largest and fastest SD card.  You will probably never fill it up, however, once you start using the video capabilities you will probably start taking more videos that you have before.  The only issue, if you could even call it that, is that the flash sits where your finger can sometimes get in the way.  Once you block it a couple of times, you learn and slide your finger back 1/4 inch.  The issue is only when you give your camera to someone else to shoot a photo.  Sometimes they block it.  Easy fix, mention it when you hand it to them.  Not a big deal.""
"20110818","4.0","No more competitive advantage to know the configuration rules!","For me, this 300HS camera comes as an upgrade from SD1000, which in turn was an upgrade from SD300.  From my prior recollection, I was not all that impressed with SD1000 iteration, but this one seems to be a very nice upgrade.First thing you notice, is that there's no longer any shortcuts to change ISO levels or use the micro mode.  That's because there's no need!  Now micro focus is activated automagically, and ISO can go quite high automatically as well, without any HIGH ISO options as was the case with SD1000.Night vision of the sensor seems very impressive, too; I'm totally sold on this BI CMOS!  The contrast as it appears in the viewfinder is often better than what you see with your own eyes as is, and you don't even have to change any settings from AUTO!  Impressive.  The only thing that appears to still be missing is HDR, I guess. :-)A nice thing in my upgrade path, from SD300 (Dig!c II processor) to SD1000 (Dig!c III) to 300HS (Dig!c 4), is that the battery format remains the same, and all the batteries are still compatible, in cameras of entirely different generations!However, I came across a few annoyances (I'll update this list as I go on):* it is not possible to use digital zoom at all if you change the aspect ratio from the default of 4:3, only optical zoom is available.  This is especially annoying if you like to reduce the size at which the pictures are saved, and use digital zoom to specifically crop only the objects in which you're explicitly interested in.""
"20110817","2.0","Not for photographers","This camera doesn't have shutter or aperture control. There is no excuse for this, canon could easily have given it a manual setting along with aperture and shutter priority, but they didn't. If you don't know what shutter and aperture are, then go ahead and buy the camera, its a fantastic point and shoot. But shutter and aperture are the very basics of how a camera works, why anyone would make a camera that doesn't let you control these is beyond me.It does have presets which gives you a vague kind of control over shutter and aperture. You can also manually control the ISO, but thats it. I think I'll be getting the 500 elph instead.""
"20110817","5.0","Graduation Gift","We gave this to our nephew as a graduation gift and he loved it. He took it overseas on a trip and the pictures turned out great.  One thing to keep in mind though (found this out the hard way since I've never purchased a camera), the memory card is not included.""
"20110814","5.0","Small camera, great pictures,the red is gorgeous!","This was kind of an impusle buy for me to replace my Canon Elph S110.  It has served me well for almost a decade, but the 2MP was limiting, and the batteries wore out and the aftermarket ones were only OK, and it had a max memory of 2GB as it used FAT.  It worked for 10 years (and still does), so I was sold on another Canon.Back in 2001, I had thought the S110 was impossibly small, but this is half the thickness.  There aren't many comments on the red model, but I think it's very sharp-looking and definitely not feminine.  I saw the black at Best Buy, and I don't think it felt all that nice...seems there's a reason the silver and red cost more; they put more money into the finish it seems.The pictures this takes are very nice, resolution is up to 4000*3000, or 12MP.  I thought my ancient S110 took good pics, but this is great.  Also, when I had bought this I thought the video would be a gimmick...but it does a GREAT job at that, too.I gave the menu a 3, because...I dunno.  It's not really easy to navigate and not too hard, but it's also a digital camera.  It is better than my S110, though.  It uses SD cards, but I chose to instead use MicroSD-in-the-adapter as it can be used in far more devices...SD-only devices are quite rare now. And to think SD was impossibly small 10 years ago!As for the camera, the screen is huge, and very nice.  I would advise putting a protective film on it, though...I had spare PDA screen protectors and I cut one to fit.  The camera is made of metal, just like my S110.  I'm not sure on the battery life, but it's probably sufficient.  I got a spare for use on day trips where I would take lots of pictures.  I find it amazing that the camera could be half the thickness of the (state of the art in 2001) S110, but the screen is 4 times larger, and the lens is also much larger.  The camera is Japanese-made, which is probably a good thing, considering most everything is made in China now.  US-made would be nice, but this is a Japanese company.I have not explored what the camera can do with manual settings, but the Auto settings work very well.  I'm not a photography-buff, and wanted something that would work well, and this delivered!""
"20110814","4.0","Extremely happy","Just got this as a replacement for an old sony cybershot.  I do a ton of research before I purchase and this was the best thing I could find in the price range.  The closest thing to it is the *panasonic* DMC-FH27 but I decided on this after looking at the interfaces and menus at the store.  The canon simply is much more straight forward and I was willing to sacrifice some zoom power and megapixels for something that didn't require hours with a manual and training session for my spouse.  Additionally, people have posted some youtube samples of the kind of video this takes and it is far superior to anything in its price range. This is important for me because we can't afford to go out and buy a specialized video camera and this will do a great job.Menu layout is intuitive.  The scene modes are AWESOME.  Very well done and despite being an amatuer I feel like this thing actually improves the quality of pictures I take. I have three picky critiques:1.  If you are going through the preview function to look at old pictures there is a quirky thing about getting back to taking pictures.  If you haven't done it long enough so that the lens retracts, you can hit the preview button again and it goes back to camera mode.  If you do it so long that the lens retracts, if you hit the preview button, the camera turns off.  This was very confusing for the first day and half of ownership.  It took a while to figure out exactly why hitting the same button would not do the same thing all the time.  So, if the lens retracts, you have to hit the capture button toget back to camera mode.  This was the only part about the interface that I thought was extremely dumb and not user friendly.2.  I was disappointed that some scenes and features in the manual set up could not be combines.  For example, you cannot do sepia and the miniatures scene simultaneously.  There are some sub functions as well that are not as intuitive as I would like.  For example, in the color highlight scene (takes black and white pic with one color retained), I have no idea how to choose which color I would like to keep and I'm not sure if I even can.  I tried this scene the other day and it chose what it felt was appropriate but it was not what I wanted.  I have yet to check the manual on that but it would be nice if it were self explanatory.3.  Battery life is a little short but recharge is only about 2 hrs. which is a third of the time it took on my last camera.  It looks like this camera would accept a power cord but it would require an adapter to put into the battery slot.4.  HD video is limited to 10 minute segments.  I know I have seen it said some places that this is to prevent the CMOS sensor from overheating.  But riddle me this Batman, if that is the case why does the camera allow me to immediately start another 10 minute HD video right after I have recorded for 10 minutes.  Would this not also overheat the CMOS sensor?  If the answer to that is yes, then canon failed to put an additional safety feature requiring you to wait for the sensor to cool down before recording in HD again.  Either way you slice it, there is an error in their design.Overall, however, this is a great and versitile camera and amatuer photographers will have little to no complaints.  BEST BUT IN ITS PRICE RANGE.Did I mention this thing is small?  Love it...""
"20110813","5.0","Great little camera","I recently purchased this camera after doing lots of research and reading all the various reviews online and I've been very happy with it.  It is very small and easy to carry around.  I got the black version with the 'sandpaper' finish on it and although i was a bit leery about it I have really grown to like it.  I've read some of the other reviews on here regarding picture quality, etc and for what you are buying it takes great pictures...the flash goes quick and the shutter speed is more then fast enough.  If you are buying this and comparing to DSLR camera quality you'll never be able to hope to compare picture quality...but remember if you want that extra bit of quality then buy a DSLR and not this.  For point and shoot cameras it is quite nice.  The functions are easy to understand and operate, although the little manual you get with the camera doesn't go over some of the more manual functions.  But you can easily go online to Cannon and get the full manual version.If you are looking for a higher quality point and shoot camera that is above the basic $100 base version type then you will like this.""

"20110811","4.0","Awesome camera for the money!","You get some much to play with in this camera! This is the best consumer digital camera upgrade I've ever made. Canon is head & shoulders above the competition in this price range & size. I live in NYC and wanted a small camera I could carry around in my pocket to take pictures or video whenever I find anything cool instead of using my phone and this camera does the trick nicely.The HD video quality in a camera so small is amazing, but of course the sound quality is lacking, so I usually combine video with my Zoom recorder for better audio. Nothing beats this camera and I tried many of them before settling on this one! The software that come with the camera is pretty cool, too. I also love that it's small and feels sturdy!  **The only issue with the black camera is the buttons can make it difficult to review photos in very low light , so maybe they could focus on making it more ergonomic in that way. Ya know, give the 'FUNC.SET' group of buttons some texture or something, so you can feel them in low light conditions. I'm thinking canon could add to budget to have the text raised to give the buttons some relief with the profit they are making on this great camera. Also flash photos you will sometimes have a lightly darker area in the lower right corner of the frame. Move the flash to the right side of the camera please!**That's my 2 cents!""

"20110811","5.0","Amazing image quality","I have several cameras ranging from this small camera that I bought to replace a damaged IS300 to D30 SLR.  I must say that I purchased the small camera to bring with me when I go on trips, the SLR was for everything else as the image quality was much better.  This new camera changed all that for me.  After trying some of the cheaper small cameras that produced horrible images, I got this and never looked back.  The images are so good that I find myself not using my DSLR much at all.  The camera even does great evening/night shots.  I was amazed.  The video is simply amazing as well.  To be able to take 10 minutes of HD video that is optically stabilized is simply unreal from something this small.Anyway, If I had known it would be this good, I would have happily paid much more, especially after trying several cheaper ones.I could not recommend a camera more that I recommend this one.

"20110806","5.0","Great compliment to a DSLR!","I should start by saying I never write reviews, but I felt this camera deserved some praise. The Powershot 300 HS has surpassed my expectations. My other camera is a 7D and have a nice collection of flashes and lenses, but I got tired of lugging it around everywhere. With my son being born I knew I would be taking lots of photos but wanted to be able to take pictures at a moments notice and not have to set a bunch of equipment up all the time. Well this was the answer to all my needs. Being an intermediate/advanced level photographer I couldn't settle to have some cheap little point and shoot. So I researched and went with the top of the line canon. In a nutshell this thing is a pocket sized version of my 7D, no lens changing of course. It lets you set up everything manually if you want to, or it will do everything for you! I was very impressed to see the addition of 1080p at 24fps video as I didnt think these things had that capability. It also can do 240fps at 320x240 and 120fps at 640x480 which is a blast to play with. There are so many features in this thing its ridiculous, there's more then the websites will even tell you. It has lots of cool creative modes, some of my favorites are 1.Panorama Assist - which guides you in taking the pictures and will stitch them together with the packaged software when you load it to your computer. 2. color isolation mode - Lets you select a color and grey every other color out. 3. Smart Shutter Detection - You can set it to take a picture when it detects a smile, wink, or when a new face enters the frame. 4. High Speed Video mode - as mentioned earlier. 5. Miniature Mode - Maybe the most fun to play with, lets you pick your area of focus and blur the rest. Also lets you record movies that play back at fast speed (smaller video size but small file size too!). Other great features you'll notice right away are its slim design (wont even know its in your pocket), fast start up speed - ready to go in under about 1 second (just disable start up screen, and incredibly easy menu navigation. The greatest part of this camera is that I dont have miss another photo opportunity because I either didn't lug my camera with or couldn't get it out in time. This thing is always on me and ready to go. Being ready for the moment is half the battle:) Don't waste your money on some cheap camera, this thing will do you proud. So many features I didn't even talk about. Just get it!""

The ELF300 is a perfect size for tucking in your shirt pocket or pant pocket. However it does not take nearly as clear pictures as my old SD1100.I have played around with the camera for a few weeks and found that it does not focus exactly where it should. I am stumped because I have never had that problem with either of my two other cameras.  At first I felt like I was doing something wrong.  I tried each focusing format and it never came out as clear as the SD1100.I am really disappointed in this from Canon.  I will keep it for the times I just want a handy camera in my pocket.""
"20110729","4.0","New, but like.","Purchased as an adjunct to my Canon Rebel XSI for times when I don't want to take the larger camera, or just want snapshots.  Still new, so haven't discovered everything it offers yet, but appears to be just what I was looking for.  Obviously doesn't take the same quality pictures as my Rebel, but don't expect or need it to.  A lot in a little package for the money.""
"20110728","4.0","Red Color Has Smooth Finish","Many excellent reviews already posted by experienced photographers.  So I'll keep it brief and mention a few things I've found.  I found the black model at Walmart and thought the texture (like sandpaper) was terrible and if that was all they had, they could keep it.  On line I found the red and gray, and they are smooth textured, much better.  I ordered the red from another retailer as they had a free case with purchase.Very nice, well built camera, made in Japan which usually indicates more quality.  Auto is great for quick shots and most use, many settings also available for more experienced photographers.  The auto focus can focus on something other than what you want, if that happens, switch the button on the back from auto down to the camera icon, choose P mode and set the focus to Center (check owner's manual for full instructions).  It will stay that way so anytime you want to better control focus all you'll have to do is switch the button down.Nice clear, colorful pictures.  Good low light ability so you don't have to blast the flash all the time. I don't use it for movies so can't comment on that.Personally, I'd stay away from the sandpaper black edition if buying this camera.""
"20110727","4.0","Why to get the silver one instead of the black one","I've always been a proponent of function over form, but this is one of the rare cases I've run into where there is such a huge difference in satisfaction with one over the other that I felt it my duty to share with fellow consumers almost immediately.  Keep in mind that this review is only to help those of you out there who have already decided that the functionality of this camera satisfies you, but you are struggling with which color to get, as I was.Long story short, I've had both a black one and a silver one in my hand over the course of the last week (black returned due to a manufacturing problem that Amazon, as always, handled in an A+ manner - I chose to replace with the silver).  Now I'm the type of guy that always gets everything in black - clothes, furniture, and especially gadgets, so naturally I gravitated toward the black model.  That being said, get the silver one - period.  The black one does look cool, but the sandpaper texture, while providing good grip, absolutely detracts from the overall value of this camera. It makes it a pain to pull out of your pocket, picks up dirt and lint like a magnet, and just has an overall cheap feel to it.  I couldn't even wipe the screen off with a microfiber cloth without it catching and nearly tearing on the housing.  When I received the silver one, the first thing I thought when I opened it was, 'You've got to be kidding me. How can a color change alone constitute such a vast difference in satisfaction?'  The answer is because I now feel like I have a quality camera I can actually use instead of something I have to constantly worry about catching on things and wiping lint off of.  Everything about the silver one blows the black out of the water; smooth finish feels very nice, looks nice, doesn't act like a lint brush, and the entire camera has a much sturdier, more solid feel to it in general.  In fact, one of the first huge things I noticed was the quality of the battery door.  I've owned many Canon P&S cameras over the years, and when I first saw the door to the black camera, it immediately struck me as something way more low budget than I'm accustomed to seeing with Canon cameras.  When I received the silver one, instantly noticed the quality was back up to par.One final consideration that always manifests apprehension in the back of my mind when considering black cameras is that black, as everyone knows, absorbs sunlight, while lighter colors reflect it.  if you're going to use it mainly indoors or at night then no problem, but if you plan on using it the sun a lot like at the beach, on vacations, heavy daylight use in general, then it only makes sense to me that black cameras in these cases would be more prone to overheating and/or accelerated mechanical wear and tear.  If it's really enough to make a significant difference in the life cycle of the product is questionable, but that's just one of those things that, unlike with phones, handheld video game systems, etc, keeps me from automatically defaulting to the black model.In summary, great camera no matter what color you get, but for the price I just feel like the silver one gives me so much more value.  I can't speak of the red one as I've not seen it, but I've heard the texture is the same as the silver, and with regards to the advantages over the black one, most of the above would still apply.  Red is more of a girly color than silver though, so please keep that in mind if you're a guy.""
"20110726","4.0","Simple Camera That Takes Good Pictures","I bought this camera about a month ago to replace an aging Olympus Point-and-shoot, and so far I've been pretty happy with it. It takes pretty nice pictures and it's really small and light so it's easy to take everywhere.Pros:Very small and lightHas a nice grippy texture so it's not so easy to drop itHas a lot of different built in modes that make it easy to get good pictures in any situation.Shoots Full HD video that looks pretty goodHas a nice wide angle lens.Cons:It has no manual modes available to control things like aperture, shutter speed or focus (this is a personal preference; you may not mind)The super slow motion movie mode (which is pretty cool) has low resolution (320x240 @ 240 fps or 640x480 @ 160 fps)The buttons are kind of small if you have big fingers- I frequently push buttons i didn't mean toThe on-camera menus are kind of confusing.All in all it's a great little camera, and it takes great pictures indoor and out. I think that, as of this writing, it's definitely the best all around compact camera in the price range and you won't be disappointed in it.""
"20110726","5.0","Love it","Love this camera. I've been using it for two months. The camera can gather light from surroundings, so it's easy to just point and shoot without worrying much about the light condition. I can take natural indoors images without using flash. The design is classic and the compact size makes it easy to carry around.""
"20110725","1.0","Beware of the lens","I am a total believer in Canon over many years and though not buying this camera from amazon, I thought of adding this review as many look for the reviews on amazon no mater where they buy the product. Despite intense love for canon I like to mark this product as a potential problem. Quality of still picture and size of camera is excellent but mine in its 4th month of use is gone dead due to 'Lens Error' message that appears on display, immediately after turning camera on. In a second camera turns off automatically and not responding anymore. Lens is stuck out and not moving. In my research I see this as a common problem of this model and if you run a search for eg on ebay, you see many are sold for part for the same reason. I am not sure if this is the result of camera's sensitivity to fall or minor hit on the lens side or a defect of model but this is not something expected from a Canon Built. I wish Canon could address the issue and finds a remedy for the users specially those left without warranty and in any case you need to be very careful with handling of this camera or better, look for some other model.""
"20110725","2.0","BEWARE THE FULL HD VIDEO!  LOOK HERE BEFORE YOU BUY!","I have been a CANON fanatic for many years.  The macro lens features of the DIGITAL ELPH series alone are like no other.  The cameras themselves are, over-all, outstanding.  They are very compact, very user-friendly and professional in results.  BUT!  READ!  Newer isn't always better.  YOU NEED TO KNOW that when you are looking for an HD video camera... and this new model is FULL-HD, UNLIKE ALL OF THE PREVIOUS CANON ELPH MODELS, this new 'upgraded version', with all it's bells and whistles and upgrades, DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO CONTROL THE HD MOVIE FEATURES!  IT FORCES YOU TO STAY IN A STUBBORN AUTOMATIC MODE, which causes footage to ALWAYS be over-exposed and washed-out.  Furthermore, during filming, the camera 'flares' the video results from one extreme to another IN EVEN THE SLIGHTEST LIGHT VARIATION!  Each and every video comes out in WAVES of bright to dark if the camera isn't in completely stable light conditions.... and you have absoultely no control over it.  HOW IRRITATING TO WATCH!  I HAVE TO ASK:  WHY EVEN BOTHER TO UPGRADE THE DIGITAL ELPH TO FULL HD CAPABILITY AND THEN NOT BE ABLE TO MANUALLY CORRECT YOUR PREFERENCES FOR LIGHT, CONTRAST, COLOR, ETC before filming??  It was unbelievable to me that something so new and upgraded was so generic in it's HD functions.  It is, in fact, so disappointing, I must now return this camera with a sad face.  LONG LIVE CANON, but absolutely skip this model if you are looking for stability of the HD VIDEO mode.  NOTE:  The previous CANON POWERSHOT SD 1400 IS is the model that correctly allows for user-options with HD.  Although not FULL HD, it is still HD.""
"20110725","5.0","Great Pocket Camera","This camera is a great deal if you are looking for a compact camera for travelling. It takes quality shots and has an amazing battery life.""
"20110725","4.0","Good, true pocket size, stylish, and well priced camera","This camera replaced a Canon PowerShot S500 digital elph, both used mostly by my wife (I usually use an SLR).It is smaller, actually about half as thick as the old one, making it truly pocket size (it very easily fits in a shirt pocket). The LCD is not the largest available in point and shoots today, but it is pretty large for the camera size, and is much larger, and of better display quality than the old one. There is no optical view finder, which I think is a big minus, but this seems to be the case now with all point and shoots, and my wife seems to have gotten used to that. Picture quality is good, but unlike the old camera that supported ISO 50, this starts at ISO 100. There are more shooting modes than with the old one, and in general more controls and a better, though not great, optical zoom (x5). I never consider digtal zoom.It is more stylish than the old one, but not as sturdy.It was not my first choice, but since my wife will use it more than I, I asked her to choose between 2 cameras ( the other was the S95 which supports RAW) She thought this was more stylish and she didn't care for RAW support (no matter how hard I tried to sell it)The bottom line is: if you are looking for a pocket size stylish camera that produces good pictures, and which can be totally autmatic but still offers reasonable amount of customization, and you don't care for RAW support, then this is a very good and well priced choice.""
"20110725","4.0","A great point and shoot camera","I purchased this camera for a 3 week trip overseas.  The size is great and makes this camera very portable! The 5X zoom with the extra wide angle also makes this camera very versatile. Image quality is fantastic. There are a ton of different shooting modes and the HD video looks great.  The super slow motion video (240 FPS) is a bit grainy and its image quality isn't too hot but it works for small, hobbyist applications (Max. resolution in super slow motion is not very high, something like 340x240).  The body is made out of metal so it's very durable, however the only thing I see as a negative with this camera is that there's no fully manual shooting mode and the black finish.  I've only had my camera for 2 weeks and the finish is starting to come off in several places. Other than that, I highly recommend this camera!!!  It's a lot easier than hauling around my DSLR w/ 4 Lenses...""
"20110724","5.0","Excellent camera","Having owned Canon compact cameras in the past, I had high expectations for this camera.  It hasn't let me down!  The size and weight and battery life are all acceptable.  I liked the fact they used the same battery which allows me to use my old battery as a backup.The LCD screen is crystal clear and the menu navigation is very similar to older models.  The picture quality is amazing and the HD video is fantastic.  The sound quality isn't great for video, but that is due to the small mic and where it is placed.  Not a big deal for me.The only downside is the camera is a bit light, doesn't feel sturdy.  That is probably due to the compact size.  I dropped our last one which is my I had to buy a new one.  This one would probably end up the same way if dropped.  Also, the wrist string can't be tightened like on older models, that is odd.  The camera write strap can easily fall off your wrist without the tightener.I use this camera with a 32 Gig Class 10 memory card and it exceeds all my needs/expectations.  I'm not a professional by any means, if you are similar and wanting a great compact camera, this is the way to go.  For the price, it gives you the best picture and video quality in my opinion.""

A big negative is it makes movies in the quicktime/mov format that does not work well Windows Media Player, Windows Movie Maker etc.  I think Canon made a very poor choice in using this format.

"20110722","5.0","I'm sharing not-so-common notes about this camera.","- I was debating between this camera and the sony cybershot wx9 for an average joe like me. Both are great options and besides price, nearly identical so you can't go wrong with either one. My decision to go with the 300HS came down to a few things that might help others choose a camera.- The sony wx9 captures 1080i AVCHD video @60fps which looks great...until I read that that file format is difficult to edit. I planned on making a lot of videos for youtube/facebook and didn't want to hassle with having tons of videos in a difficult file format to edit and share. To test this, I downloaded several AVCHD videos from torrents and sure enough, it took me a while to find a video player that would consistently play it smoothly without crashing. The canon 300HS uses .mov files which are easy to edit with just about any video editing software. This was the biggest deal breaker for me.- Although the canon 300HS's video quality is 24fps and not 60, for my non-professional use, I think it looks fantastic! I have recorded videos @ 1080i, uploaded them to youtube, and watched them through an internet connected TV at a best buy store that has 120hz or 240hz motion plus enabled and the video is EVEN BETTER! Smooth as butter! That made me realize I didn't need 60fps. Go to youtube and search for 'canon 300HS test video' and see for yourself. Then watch the same video on high end TV or monitor. You see? You don't REALLY need the extra FPS and bigger file size for your boring video :)- I was worried that limited maximum video length would be annoying, but honestly, I never record anything longer than 10 minutes. Moreover, stopping recording, and starting to record a new video takes 3 seconds. After buying the camera, missing 3 seconds is not a deal breaker as I once thought it would be.- About the camera and windows XP: My only gripe is that when I have the camera connected to XP, I can't browse the content of the memory card through 'My Computer'. I have to browse through it via the canon software. However, using the canon software is FASTER than through windows XP! If I have a folder with hundreds of pictures and hundreds of .mov files, the canon software FLIES while browsing it and it even shows thumbnails of videos. XP only shows a generic icon. Finding a video and switching between one video and the next is INSTANT in the canon software, but takes AGES thru XP! My PC is no slouch either.- About the canon software: I honestly had zero expectations. I thought it would be slow, bloated, sluggish, featureless, and painful to use, but I was actually impressed! I found it to have everything I needed to handle hundreds of pictures and videos, browse, sort, delete, rename, and have them ready to share with friends without pulling my hair out. In fact, the built-in option to upload straight to youtube was a nice surprise, because that's what I intended to do A LOT and made me glad I made this purchase. Sidenote, there is no option to upload to facebook or twitter with the canon software. I didn't read this in other reviews.- Here's my biggest retrospective point and lesson learned. I obsessed over which camera to buy based on specs and reviews and sample images and recordings. It got to the point where I was scared to buy ANYTHING. In the end, I realized, I just needed a simple point and shoot camera to take pictures of my friends and I hanging out and occasional video that only WE would care about. This camera met and exceeded my expectations. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase and I get compliments about my camera and my pictures all the time and I don't even try. The camera does all the work for me!- Canon sells a waterproof cover for this camera on their website. I have not tried or tested it. Canon does not make these housings for all their models. I did not read this is in other reviews.- I bought a $10 plastic shield for the LCD screen like the types you would put on an iPhone and used a blade to trim to size. Now I'm not afraid to put the camera down on the LCD side on rough surfaces like rocks or wooden picnic tables. I didn't think of this for a while when I first bought it, but glad I did before I incurred any damage to the screen. Did not read this in other reviews either lol.- You can edit your videos straight from the camera! Trim the begging, trim the end, or both, then save the slimmed down video as a NEW file straight to your camera, or overwrite the existing file! This is an AWESOME time saver when you are on the go! It frees up memory too! I use this ALL THE TIME and didn't think about looking for it as an option in a camera. I'm glad its there!- The automatic panoramic picture mode in Sony's camera is impressive and EASY to use. You just shoot and turn the camera and you're done. With the canon camera, you have to go through a confusing and complex set of steps that its faster and less stressful just to take sequential pictures yourself than to try and use the canon's menu system. I honestly couldn't figure out how to take panoramic pictures with this camera. It's very confusing, but I don't care. I never take panoramic pictures.- When I plug in my camera with an HDMI cable to my TV, I can use my TV remote to control the camera menu on my TV! I can browse, edit videos, and more sitting on my couch across the room! Did not read this in other reviews and an AWESOME way to share videos and pictures at your friend's house. I don't know if only certain TVs let you do this, but for what its worth, I have a Samsung LED TV from 2010. Way cool! Wish I figured this out sooner hehe!- Battery life: Kinda sucks if you take a lot of video (because you forget how many times you re-watch it and fail to take that into account). However, lots of my friends have canon cameras and they (not all) have the exact same battery so I often borrow theirs instead of buying a spare. Like asking around for a phone charger in a clutch. Whodathunk? Not me, until I realized tons of ppl have canon cameras. :)- I love the slow-mo capture mode! The quality is crappy but the effect is always fun! My friends always want to play with this! I wasn't expecting to use this as much as I do! Kind of an unexpected ROI!- Cliff notes: Excellent camera for daily use!! You and your friends will be impressed!!""
"20110721","5.0","Crisp, Clear, and Comfortable","I bought this camera on sort of an impulse buy. I researched it for a couple weeks and was deciding between this one and the Canon PowerShot S90.I chose this model because I wanted the 1080 recording functionality, the slim size, and the ability to take pictures in a dark-ish setting.I tried this camera out in a local park for three hours and never lost a bar of battery, and my pictures are all crisp, clear, and gorgeous. I am in love with the colors of this camera. Great for beginners.The only con I see with it, is that I wish it were a touch screen.I will continue to use it, and will update if any problems or major mind-blowing features are discovered.""
"20110721","5.0","Great Camera, Lots of Features, good HD Video, but bad software","I love this little camera! The pictures it takes are spectacular, and it literally fits in your shirt pocket. The main reason I bought it was to replace my bulky HD Camcorder, and I am very happy with the video quality and sound, even in relatively low light. On a 16 GB SDHC Card, it can fit about 1 hour of 1080P HD Video. It also has image stabilization, and a slow zoom (which is a good thing). The caveat is that the maximum length of each clip is about 15 minutes. Another caveat is that while you can zoom while taking video, the zooming motor sound can be heard in the  video. The one thing I did not like is the Software that came with the Camera. I replaced my old Canon software with this one, and this software is hard to use, and does not even have the features the old software used to have. But the Camera itself is excellent, and I highly recommended it.""

"20110718","5.0","Great little camera  !","I wanted to replace my 10 year old Canon sd 450 which still works great; but wanted to get a newer one.  I researched, I read all the reviews, and finally came to the conclusion that for my needs, the Elph 300 would serve me best.And I was correct.  I got it about a month ago, & took it on our vacation and it took great photos, and videos.  I would have gone for the elph 500 but the only draw back was that it is a bigger camera, and doesn't easily fit in a pocket.That's the reason I selected the elph 300, because it does a lot, does it well; and is small enough to carry around on vacation.I would highly recommend it.""
"20110718","3.0","Good camera - don't buy the black one!","This is my 3rd canon digital elph, and hopefully not my last one (I'm only replacing the previous model because American Airlines shattered it).  Amazon was out of the silver model when I bought it, so I got the black one.  That was a mistake.  It's got some sort of texture to it that just makes it horrible to handle.  It's rough, it feels bad coming in an out of your pocket, a case, whatever.  Cleaning the screen is almost impossible because the 'texture' grabs hold of most soft cloths that you would use.  I could easily see this snagging a sweater, etc.  The only thing I could imagine this texture would be for is improved grip, but honestly, I don't think that's ever been a problem for anyone.  These things are so light that it takes almost no effort to hold on to them.  The texture also collects any dirt or other particles around it.  After 5 minutes in my pocket (this is a pocket camera, after all) with what appeared to be a completely clean/empty hard candy wrapper, the camera came out covered in pink mess.  Also, the wrist strap on this model wasn't soft and flexible, but instead very stiff.  If I wasn't wearing it, but just grabbed the camera for a quick snapshot, I had to be very careful that the strap didn't stick straight out into the picture.  That should never be a problem one has to worry about.The picture quality on this camera isn't quite as good as it was on my previous model (SD770IS).  The quality isn't quite as sharp, the colors aren't quite as good, etc.  I can only hope that my particular camera was a fluke, both in the quality of the pictures and the roughness of the textures.  Come to think of it, I may pick up a different model instead of another one of these - maybe the SD4000IS or SD4500IS.""

"20120409","2.0","disappointed...","I had high hopes for this camera, after reading so many glowing reviews.  I was looking for a small and light camera that I could take anywhere.  While my old powershot A620 still takes great pictures, I wanted a camera with newer features such as hd video and better low light performance.  My experience with the elph 300 hs has disappointed me in several ways.  Compared with my trusty A620, pictures taken with the elph 300 hs do not look nearly as crisp - almost soft, especially toward the corners and edges. I've played with settings and typically use P mode.  I just cannot seem to get decent pictures with this camera.  Other complaints I have are the autofocus speed, barrel distortion with wide angle, inconsistent exposure, weak flash, and horrible lens flare.  The bottom line is that the image quality simply isn't there with this camera.  While I would love to have a camera I can slip in a pocket, I am not willing to compromise image quality enough to use this camera when I want to take halfway decent pictures.  I will grab my A620 every time - even if it doesn't fit in a pocket. Of course, I am not expecting dslr performance from this little camera.  My basis for comparison is my experience with my A620, my kid's A590is, and my dad's sd1100is. This little camera has many features in a very small package & might be a fun little toy for someone who isn't picky about image quality.Pros:small, yet comfortable to hold and operateexcellent battery lifemany featuresexcellent burst modebuild qualityCons:image quality / softness, even when sharpness setting is adjustedblurring of corners and edgeslens flare - much worse than other point & shoot cameras I have used, makes pictures look washed out (vs. attractive flare)autofocus speedflash - weak and inconsistent (and easy to block with finger at first)inconsistent metering, compared with other cameras I have usedbarrel distortion at wide angle""

"20120409","3.0","Could not meet my expectation","I got this one from Amazon last year for a trip to China. My wife used it primarily and I used for a few times since my main camera is a DSLR.If you are serious about image quality, this one would NOT work for you. It can only serve as a travel camera that has better pictures than cellphones.My very first Canon digital camera was also purchased from Amazon. It was way back in 2004 and the model was S500. Unfortunately, my mother-in-law broke it four years ago. If my memory serves right, the old one gave better picture quality than this new one.Pro1. compact2. battery lasts a whole day with full charge (600 pictures, some flashes, a couple videos)4. cosmetically pleasing5. enough picture quality for web sharing and 4x6 printsCon1. really soft images (focusing problem?)2. clear distortion at wide (24mm) and tele focal length3. video not true HD quality and taking humongous space comparing to any digital camcorder4. the advertised high-ISO sensitivity was achievable but at expense of very soft focus and blur (slow shutter speed)5. could have been more useful if aperture/speed/manual program was avaiableIn short, this camera did not meet my expectation. It was not much better than my old Canon compact. If you want to upgrade from your cellphone pictures, this could be it.

"20110706","4.0","Good all-in-one device, Pictures a tad disappointing","I bought this camera to replace our Canon Powershot SD1100 IS.  I liked having a single device that took good photos and video, but I wanted to start recording home videos in HD.  I also didn't like a couple limitations of the SD1100's video recording (no zoom, fixed focal length).  I considered an upgrade to the SD1400, but it doesn't support full HD and still has the same basic video limitations (focal length is fixed for duration of recording although digital zoom is enabled).  The 10 minute limit on video files doesn't bother me much because most of our home movies are recorded in small increments.After watching some sample videos other users posted online, we decided to step up to the 300 HS.  I bought 2 16 GB memory cards and took the camera on our trip to Orlando.  We recorded about 45 minutes of full HD video and about 250 pictures on a single 16 GB card.  The battery life was OK, but we certainly needed to recharge several times on the trip.  After getting home, I took a look at what we got.  The video is very good.  The image and sound are both very clear.  I don't hear any camera noises in any of the video although there was plenty of ambient sound which could have covered it up.  Occassionaly the video has a tendency to 'jump' when the camera is panning or zooming but it wasn't frequent (panning/zooming slowly seems to help).  I'm so glad we swtiched to this camera for the sake of the improved video quality we got.As for the pictures, I'm a tad disappointed.  I thought the images from my SD1100 were great (images were sharp, well exposed, and had good color).  For the most part, the pictures from my 300 HS looked good.  They're very sharp and bright.  On the negative side, many of the pictures had very oversatured colors.  In particular, green grass and pink skirts looked unnaturally bright.  Fortunately, I could tone them down a little with picture editing software.  I'm assuming the switch from a CCD to a CMOS sensor is partly to blame.My other minor nitpick with the camera is the tendency of the LCD to scratch easily.  This was a problem on our SD1100 too.  I'd recommend a scratch protection film.Otherwise, I'm quite happy.  I'd gladly recommend the camera to friends and family.""

The image may be a little soft, but OK for common use.  It is not much worse than my Canon XSi with the standard lens that come with the camera.  The only thing is that there is no manual adjustment.  But for the small size that I can easily carry it around, I am using it much more often than the other cameras.  Due to the small size, and hence the small battery, it is advisable to buy extra batteries for backup.  The generic batteries on Amazon for this camera are only a few dollars a piece.""

"20110628","5.0","Excellent camera, great value.","I purchased this item through Amazon and received it yesterday from Ace Photo Digital, and I am very happy with my purchase so far. The camera arrived quickly (at the early end of the expected delivery window) and was carefully packaged. I charged up the battery and 45 minutes later got to work.I got the black finish option. It isn't a smooth finish, but a little rough, like fine-grit sandpaper. I really like it because the camera is quite small in stature, and the finish allows for a sure grip at all times. After a brief initial set-up (set date/time and select language) I started snapping some shots in auto-mode. Wow, what a clean picture. I came from a 6 mega-pixel point and shoot, so 12 mega-pixel unit is a healthy upgrade. Pictures are sharp, balanced and vibrant, even in the low lighting around my place. I stepped outside and snapped a few more in the sunlight and found more of the same.Having mastered auto-mode (and who can't really?) I opened up the menu and started playing with some of the features. I've seen some reviews complain that putting the camera into a particular mode is too cumbersome, and I have a couple thoughts on that. Number one, the menu is optimally set up, easy to read and navigate. Icons illustrate the various modes, with text alongside to explain what each mode is and what it does. Selecting a mode was simple. Number two, as far as selecting a mode on the fly, any pro photographer will tell you one of the secrets to taking great pictures is planning ahead. I really don't know what Canon could do to make it any faster, other than assigning individual buttons on the camera for each mode, and that's not exactly feasible. Several features are included, so unleash your creativity! Video mode is nice as well, easy to use and shoots great video.Only two negatives I can think of for this purchase is something that plagues too many electronics when buying online. I want to know exactly what's in the box, and I couldn't find that anywhere in the product description. I ordered an SD card along with my purchase and I'm glad I did, because one is not included with the camera (that may very well be standard procedures these days, but I'm pretty sure my old Canon came with a card). So I will tell you what IS in the box: camera, manuals, cd-rom, RCA cable to connect with a tv, USB cable, one battery, and one wall-charger. The second drawback is that the LCD display screen is a bit exposed. In this small package space is a premium and it seems like the screen is pushed outward a little to compensate. I'm looking forward to the arrival of my protective case.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. Tons of features, easy to use, excellent pictures and a great price. Highly recommended.""
"20110626","1.0","Really Disappointed!","Feature-wise, this camera is exactly what I wanted.  It takes decent pictures and video and the zoom feature works while taking video. I bought this as an upgrade for the Canon SD730IS which I have used a lot over the last few years. I would simply carry it around in my pocket and even on my bike rides.  I even dropped the 780IS once while on the bike and, while it got scratched up a bit, it still works to this day.  There are some scratches on the back...However, the 300HS (Black) has really soft metal on the front face as part of the lens structure -- those 3 outer rings you see which are part of the mechanism that allows the lens to extend outward.  After one short trip where I put this camera in my pocket along with my Droid Incredible phone, the camera now has a bunch of dents in these surfaces.  The lens still extends outward as needed, but I'm sickened to see it all messed up so quickly. It looks as it has been badly abused.  The front face of my 780IS is still in tact with several places of missing paint on the rear side.So, I'm NOT a happy camper here. Beware of this camera.  Don't put it in your pocket or purse, or let it make contact with anything. It needs a case which, IMO, takes away the advantage of its small size.  For my intended use, that makes the camera almost useless.Edit: As of December 2011, this camera no longer works.  The lens gets stuck while extending. It has barely been used. This was a total waste of money.""

Enough advanced settings for special occasions, but, honestly, even in some bizarre situations, still comes out with great pictures, so, why do you need all the extra settings?

But I am so disappointed because the pictures are almost not useful at all and much worse than my 4 years old cannon SD450/470. Also, by reading other camera reviews, it seems very normally happened to most of the latest compact cameras regardless which brand is.

It still has the half-press for AF but, it shoots when you want it to, instead of lagging with flash, etcImage Quality - Comes with a CMOS sensor and shoots full HD video.Design - The black one (the one I bought) strays away from the glossy finish that attracts fingerprints. It features a sandpapery feel that allows for better grip and the 'feel' of durability. I actually prefer it to the glossy finish.Cons -Modes - There are way too many. I presume it is for today's experimental photographers. Don't get me wrong, they have some pretty cool modes ,such as 'miniature.'

This camera has very noticeable fringing or chromatic Aberration problem cased by poor lens engineering. My old A590 had virtually no fringing issues..  Most people probably would overlook this but if you are a person who loves photography with a keen eye and want crisp clean pics, this issue will drive you nuts. I couldn't tolerate it so returned mine.. Everything else is fine but I still wouldn't recommend this camera for photography enthusiasts or for anyone considering it is a premium class camera with a serious problem.

"20110618","4.0","Canon 300 HS - A Good, but not Great, P&S","This is a good, but not great P&S.  If you have realistic expectations, you'll probably be happy with it.  If you think you are getting a DSLR type photo quality in this package, you should think again.We bought this camera when we had lost our Canon SD 800 IS, which, at the time it came out was one of Canon's top of the line cameras.  Because we had a graduation, I went to a store with a reasonable return policy (in case we found the SD 800, which we did later).  I ended up taking about 200 pictures with this camera.  Here are some thoughts:Size - this camera is incredible small.  About the size of a Blackberry phone.  Easily pocketable.Zoom - one of the most useful zoom ranges in any pocket camera 24-120 is a sweet sweet zoom spot.Grip - we had the black with the textured feel.  I liked it, but my wife didn't much care for it.  Try before you buy.Photo quality - while the pictures were generally pretty good, I thought that this camera would blow away the 7 MP SD 800s photos, but for the most part, it did not.The amazing thing about this camera is that on Auto mode, which is how most people would use it, there were a couple of outside shots that were unbelievably amazing and remained sharp no matter how much I blew them up.  There were about 2 such pictures out of 100.  The lens needs alot of light to be at its best, and I really could not duplicate the sharpness on Auto no matter what I did.  I guess sometimes the camera's IQ is good, and sometimes, it isn't as good.Indoor shots are okay, but there was marginal, if any improvement from SD 800 indoor pictures and that camera came out about 6 years ago, that's two sensor generations and one lens generation (although I think the quality of Canon's glass was better then and the sensors are better now).  As I mentioned above, we actually found the SD 800 after the graduation and I took a couple of test shots to make a comparison (because I was thinking of keeping the 300 HS).  Generally speaking, there was not that big a difference in the pictures to bother with the upgrade.Thus, for a P&S it is a good camera, but will not blow you away with the results.  However, if you are buying it just to print out 4x6, which is what we do with our SD 800, you likely will be satisfied, but if you are thinking of upgrading from a prior generation Canon P&S the difference in photo quality may not be enough to make the switch worthwhile.Best of luck in your purchasing decision!""

I am extremely pleased with this product.""
"20110617","2.0","Way over rated!","My trusty Canon SD630 starting to get a little worn so I decided to upgrade to a similar sub-compact point and shoot. The Elph 300Hs is almost identical in size to the older SD630 with a few more rounded edges.  Right away it felt a little slippery in my hands but I liked the fact I could use the same case, battery charger, and battery as my old camera.  The menu system has been revised from older Canons but all things considered if felt pretty familiar.My first use was in a trip in the mountains.  The outdoor shots in Auto mode were just ok and frankly I was a little disappointed with the sharpness and detail. Everything had a washed out appearance (which I recognized as overexposure later) The real problems started when I took the camera to my son's wedding. The auto mode produced horrible pictures. Overexposure (noted by some reviews) was present in almost all shots. In some cases I took shots within a second of each other with the same scene and the Auto setting drastically changed.  ISO, aperture, speed was all over the place.  I ended up switching to program settings to fix the ISO at 100, keep the flash on, changed to vivid, and fiddled with the exposure.  This helped a little but I still was not happy, especially since I expect a point and shoot to work well in Auto. I then tried some more fixed settings with higher ISO and no flash to take advantage of the sensitivity.  I can honestly say the results were worse than my cell phone camera.  Giving up I switched back to Auto for the rest of the wedding and ended up taking many bad pictures with motion artifacts, overexposure, out of focus, you name it.This camera may have been defective but I don't think so. After doing some more research it seems that these CMOS sensors my not quite be ready for prime time.  I sent the camera back and upgraded to the Canon S95. I could not be happier!  The S95 takes amazing pictures in auto mode and is a lot of fun to try out some of the manual options.Do not get fooled by all the positive 300HS reviews. This camera is not worth the high price.  You would be much better off going more high end with the S95 or just buying a cheaper point and shoot and saving some money.""

"20110611","4.0","A Sweet Point And Shoot Camera","Based partly on the reviews here, I bought the Elph 300HS Silver, and played with it for several hours, initially shooting about 150 stills and about 10 minutes of video.  I settled on the Elph 300HS because I wanted a reliable and solid point and shoot camera, where the Auto feature would do all the work.  I admit I'm no photography pro, and I certainly don't have the time, patience, or inclination to fiddle with all the interminable and esoteric photographic settings, nor did I want a bulky camera to lug around.The video looks very good, especially on a hi-def monitor but tends to blur very slightly when zooming in too fast.  And I have to admit that having a zoom feature on hi-def video was a strong selling point for me.  The tiny stereo microphone works fine, and like all other similar cameras, picks up the ubiquitous wind sounds.  You should also be aware that these hi-def videos take up a lot more file space on your SD cards than 'mere' DVD quality.I compared one or two pics on the Elph to the same shots taken at the same time on my older Canon Powershot A710IS (12 vs. 7 megapixels) and there was a slight discernable increase in the quality of the still shots.  I had hoped that the Elph photos would be much sharper and clearer because of the newer technology and the additional 5 megapixels, but the increase in quality, while noticeable, was minimal.  In all fairness, however, I did not print the photos, I only viewed them on my hi-def monitor.  With the price of ink cartridges these days, I'm very selective about printing color photos on my printer, but I am certain that the Elph photos, if printed, would look much better than those of my older camera.As claimed, the Elph does indeed take great shots in lower light, but the tradeoff for this is that the resulting photos seem to be a little softer than the shots taken in normal light.Another slight disappointment, as pointed out in another review, is that the videos are saved as .mov files rather than .avi or .wmv files.  Windows Movie Player will play them, but only by expanding the file types to 'any file'.  Fortunately, there are several programs out there which will convert these .mov files.  The one I use, Prism Video File Converter, can convert these .mov files to .wmv files (among others), and the .mov file sizes are reduced by an astonishing factor of one fifth, without a noticeable decrease in quality.  If you plan to edit or combine your Elph videos by using Windows Movie Maker, it will happily handle .wmv files, but not .mov files.The really surprising thing about the Elph is its very tiny size, a worthy example of the art and science of miniaturization.  Yet, it still feels quite heavy in the hand, no doubt due to all the electronic components packed into its tiny but solid metal frame which provide all its many features.  Bottom line?  It ain't perfect, but it's one hell of a sweet point and shoot camera.""
"20110611","2.0","photo happy, owns SLR and old canon 890 both superior quality to this in regard to photo compression","FirstMuch like the Canon PowerShot SD890 IS the build is GREAT!!!!!  Better in my opinion ( this from someone who has repaired her 890 after dropping to get it to take photos again, ya OPENED and it works perfectly :)  )it is smaller and thinner then previous PowerShots and even some of the 3000 and 4000 range which I tested and returned  the same day due to a similar issue that this model has.  LACK OF DETAIL in laments terms and for others the compression and more so I feel the digic 4 processor makes the camera for those who will need to take photos and edit USELESS.  HOWEVER, if you want a simple point and shoot and will never edit your photos then get it.  If you want something that allows you to lets say take shot where someone has closed their eyes and edit their eyes from another photo where they are open THIS IS NOT THE CAMERA FOR YOU!  (or me as I have done this with my Canon PowerShot 890 IS for a photo from a bridal shower of a friend)The video zoom is great, grainy but better then my 890IS my SLR does not have video which makes me peeved but the fact that it has a digic III processor every photo comes out fantastic.I want to keep this camera because the build is great and it does take web posting worthiness photos when there is good lighting aka indoors in a kitchen but with the lights on and natural light from outside HOWEVER the loss of detail is there on zoom and not suitable for large prints or editing only for 'as is' shots etc.I am a Canon user/fan for years and upgraded and upgraded from one Canon to the next and after trying theCanon PowerShot Elph 1400 and SD1300 and now this model....I think I am going to have to abandon a brand I loved for over a decade.  I am so sad that despite consistent complaints that canon has not rectified the compression issue.  My 10 megapixel old Canon PowerShot takes better photos then this and the other aforementioned NEW models then there is a problem.  I had my Peterbald sit in his bed in low light conditions using flash and full auto on both this model the 300 and my old model the 890 and the loss of detail on this model was abysmal compared to my 890 using same subject same lighting conditions and same distance and same sd card.So I am back on the hunt for replacement still and every camera that has the digic 4 and regardless of cmos or ccd because they have such a high pixel count the cameras just do not cut the mustard and this issue is I need a point and shoot that has video for when I am taking pictures of my Peterbalds or my baby cousins or anything to have to lug my slr and my video cam (which is a canon btw which is great) is ridiculous.signed really ticked and hoping Canon comes out with something better...:(""
"20110609","3.0","I wanted to love it but...","I feel like Canon has been putting out products that aren't as well-made as before.  I'm going to start with the design.  I was glad they've added black in their color variation, but on this particular model the black is dull.  Not sure if it's matte black, but there's a texture on it that I don't quite like.  It feels alright when you've got slippery hands but the texture attracts dust like a moth to a flame.  I wish Canon would adopt some design ideas from Sony or Samsung.  The LCD screen feels like it's not secure, and if you look closely you can see the spaces between the lcd and the camera.  The bottom right of the screen kind of pops up and i dont really feel good about it.  I actually got a replacement because I thought the first one i had was a bad one, but the second one is just the same.  I'm in the process of returning the replacement for a refund.What I liked about this camera was the ease of use and how fast it operated.  The new HS system is really nice indeed.  I don't think i liked the CMOS sensor though.  It caused overexposure often, and colors were off and flat looking.  I always had to use Vivid color mode which on my previous Canon Powershot was extremely vivid and saturated but on the 300 HS it's normal colors.  I own a Canon T2i and a Panasonic LX3, i've tried numerous cameras in the past so I can say i know a thing or two about IQ. I am by no means a 'pro' photog. I don't do 'portraits' or those studio-like pictures but I am into still life and street photography.  The Elph 300 HS is good for snapshots.  Clear images with very minimal to no noise at all.  It does smear a bit but isn't as bad.  I wouldn't go above ISO800 though.  And the i-Contrast is just horrible, don't use it you wont need it.  The HD video is AMAZING, though the mic is super sensitive to wind so it's a little downside.  I don't record video anyway.  Most people who are getting this probably want it for low-light pictures.  I'd have to say the low light performance is better than a regular Canon Powershot SD but don't expect wonders because it still has a small sensor and an aperture that isnt wide enough. If you want anything close to dSLR quality images, you'll be better with any of the advanced p&s like the Canon S95, Panasonic LX5, Olympus XZ1, Samsung EX1 etc.  All of those have a sensor of 1/1.7' or bigger, and the Oly and Samsung have an aperture of 1.8!  Another thing i want to bring up is the inconsistency of the images.  The focus on this camera doesn't seem to be as effective as older models, so trying to shoot macro is a little bothersome because it takes several times for it to find the subject.  I think for the price, it should perform a little better.  My advice is to get the 100 HS and save $50, or spend a little more and get the SX210.  If you're looking for best image quality as an alternative to a dSLR then  you might want to get the advanced p&s that i mentioned.  if you just want a camera to take snapshots and want decent IQ, you would be fine with any of the Canon A series, even the SD1300 and SD1400.""
"20110609","4.0","Wonderful Little Camera, but watch out for the black shadow","This camera works best in Program Mode. Like others have said, images appear better in ISO 100. When using the flash, my only concern is the black shadow in the bottom right corner of images. I've discovered a new way to avoid the infamous black shadow. Remember: 'Keep the light on the right.' If you have a light source, keep it on the right of your shooting frame. I took several photos and noticed that if i moved the bottom right corner of the frame into a light source, the black shadow disappears. You could also Zoom to avoid the black shadow. Anyway, it's best not to use the flash if you don't have to. Canon could have avoided this issue by moving the flash to the right side. Other than that, this camera is wonderful!Make sure to buy a spare Canon battery and camera case!""
"20110609","4.0","great camera, with a few caveats","Quickly:  very pleased with this camera, good for indoor kid shots and such.Longer (much!) version for those interested...Background  We've been looking for a replacement for our dear SD870IS which died of the dreaded lens error.  We've been using a SD4000IS in the interim, which is acceptable, but hasn't quite lived up to the 870's shooting performance or image quality.  We've been through (and returned) countless P&S's from various mfr's, and this 300HS is the closest we've come to an adequate replacement.(Aside:  I found it interesting that I'm not the only SD870IS user that has ended up here, see other reviews -- pretty sure we're all seeking something similar.  I'd have bought another 870, but they're now going for 2X original price, yikes, and I know from trying some refurbs hands-on that it's a big gamble on whether it ever fully recovers from the surgery)The particular niche that we're in, and is one that I think this camera suits, is indoor shooting, kids and such, without flash.  For us, a camera either does a good job in that situation or it's a failure.  This is a job best left for our DSLR, of course, but when away from home (birthday parties, etc) we want a P&S that can at least come close.  I'd say my expectations are high, but not unreasonable - the SD870IS met our needs.So this review is targeted in that direction.  Outdoor shots in full sun aren't nearly as challenging, and this camera does a fine job at those, so it's not worth much comment from me.  Instead I'll focus solely on the 'is it good for indoors' aspects.Short answer:  Yes!  (but, see 'But...' below)The sensor is quite sensitive.  The lens is (can be) quite fast.  The autofocus is (can be) quite responsive.We're about 1000 shots into this camera.  Maybe 100 of those are 'careful' shots, and another 900 or so that were taken haphazardly just playing with the camera in various ways.  The vast majority of careful shots were 'keepers', and quite a number of the haphazard shots turned out as well.  (By 'careful' I mean that, at the very least, time was taken to frame and half-press prefocus in anticipation of the right moment;  by 'haphazard' I mean just point and full-press, cross fingers, and hope something interesting happens when the shutter opens)Images are of low noise, not overly softened, and (for the most part) have proper tone/balance/color/etc, JPG artifacts seem minimal (using best setting), etc - overall quite pleased with image quality.BTW, I'm not a megapixel junky, 12 is plenty, don't fall for the hype.  Canon is (partially) headed in the right direction by (partially) reversing this trend.  I say (partially) because they have other models that are still chasing that megapixel marketing monster with 1/2.3' CCD sensors, which seems ridiculous to me.  The A3300IS, for example, would not at all be appropriate _for me_.Heck, I'd be fine if this had been a 10Mpx sensor in the hopes of getting yet one more stop of sensitivity.  That's a tradeoff I'd gladly make.  (SD870IS is only 8, SD4000IS is only 10, both are adequate for our use)  I say this only so you get a sense of where I'm coming from, what's important to me in this review - maybe it is/isn't important to you.  That tiny sensor DOES appear to have enough sensitivity to support (most of) Canon's HS hype at 12Mpx.The 24-105mm f2.7-5.9 is very nearly same as 870's 28-205 f2.8-5.8 on paper.  Just a tiny smidge wider and faster at full wide.  Though my sense is that the 870 might have had a bit better glass overall.But... to get the most out of the low light sensitivity of this camera you'll have to live within it's sweet spot.  It's not AS fast, with just ANY settings.Some caveats:  The lens is only fast at it's widest setting, and gets noticeably slower quite rapidly with any amount of zoom.  That's fine for our use, as we zoom with our feet, and in fact I just treat it as a 28mm prime lens.  (if you're outdoors in sun, f5.9 at full tele is plenty fast, so full range of lens is usable)  Problem with wide angle is (as mentioned by others) the flash is too close to lens and bottom-right will be shadowed.  Again, that's fine for our use, as I despise flash, and force it off.  I'd rather have an underexposed picture in natural light than a properly exposed picture using any P&S-caliber flash, so I'm willing to ignore this flaw.  Auto mode isn't always that smart, and it does seem to slow down shooting performance noticeably.  Some of this is apparently the continuous AF, which, while would be a handy feature, seems to be a performance penalty rather than benefit, and is only available in Auto mode.  The remainder is probably the 'scene detector', you can often witness it 'change its mind' as to what it thinks you're shooting if there activity in the scene.  Program mode, even with everything left at defaults, is far better, and is definately my favored mode of operation.  Auto white balance can be fooled, though it's more often ok than not.  A small gripe, and is the case with most P&S's, so I'm not overly faulting this camera.  Again, though, if you're inside and can set it to tungsten (or as appropriate, or manual) specifically, you'll get better consistency.  (and tho I can't confirm it rigorously, i have the feeling that this too, like auto-scene detect, makes the camera ever-so-slightly less responsive in full auto mode - so set it yourself and solve two problems at once)  BTW, if you can accept the reduced resolution, the 3Mpx modes (high speed burst & low light) offer opportunities to capture some photos that I'd never expect a camera of this size to get.  I've tried similar modes on current Nikon/Sony/etc, though none were as effective imo.  For the most part, I don't intend this review to cover the other 'effect' modes, as I myself will never use them, but these two modes seemed worth mentioning.Other issues:  I do miss the 3' screen of the 870IS.  I sort of wish there were a '400HS' model that used the (nice) screen from the Sx230HS.  (am personally NOT a fan of 500HS's touchscreen)  Of course it'd have to be a bit bigger, but that's ok, it's so tiny right now there's some room to grow and still be pocketable, and they could probably then fix the flash location too.  My dream imaginary '400HS' would also have the remaining PSAM modes (shutter/aperature/manual missing here) of the Sx230HS.  I'd particularly like to have a shutter priority mode (or at least a 'sports' type scene mode that strongly favors fast shutter in its overall solution).  But I don't need the 230's GPS, don't like it's flash, don't need all that zoom, don't like the lens speed tradeoff you make for that zoom, autofocus seems a bit laggier with that lens, etc -- in short, the Sx230HS wasn't a good fit for me overall, so that extra bit of control was something I had to gave up to get a better overall fit with the 300.A note on the texture of the black model:  It's subtle, and I personally like it, makes it feel like a camera.  No, it's not sleek like your cell phone, but you can get the red or silver model if you'd rather have a camera that's more likely to slip out of your hands.Summary:  If you're doing well-lit shots, then no problem recommending this camera, it's as good if not better than others in this price range.  If you're doing poorly lit shots, particularly if you don't need zoom, then I'd highly recommend this camera, as it's currently better than any other that I'm aware of in this price range.  Same for all the current 'HS' line (Elph 100/300/500 HS, Sx20HS), I've tried all of them, though this is the one that best suited me, so I know it best -- check out the other model specs and see which best suits you.  I'd give this camera 4.5 stars if I could - as I more than 'like it', but fall short of 'loving it'.  It's really just about as good as it can be for what it is and what it costs, but Amazon calls their stars 'like/love', so 4 is more appropriate.  I'd have to reserve 5 stars for the ficticious '400HS' as described above - come on Canon, build it!! :D""

Lately, its just my red IXUS 220 HS (or ELPH 300) that I bring along everywhere. It's simply amazing what this small gadget can do and I haven't even explored half of its features yet. Though, I'm used to shooting in RAW (which this camera doesn't have), it's JPEG output is great. In fact, some of my shots look so professional that my colleagues couldn't distinguish some of my shots taken with this camera compared to my pictures taken with my 5DMkII. Together with my iPad and an SD adapter, I can easily show my pictures and video in a bigger screen in a jiffy. I'll probably get a Eye-Fi X2 card for this camera so that I can wirelessly upload the pictures to my iPad since this camera is very compatible with the Eye-Fi technology or as what the manual says. Simply a must for photo enthusiasts!!""
"20110606","4.0","Watch your Lens Cover","A lot of people have done a good job covering the camera.  I am highly pleased with it.  I do have one caution.  The tiny lens cover that covers the lens when it is powered down is subject to being damaged easily.  I noticed something on my lens recently when I was out taking pictures.  After having cleaned the lens, I powered the camera off and noticed that thin cover did not close properly.Recommendation:  do not put it in your pocket without a case covering the lens.  I believe that something in my pocket caused the problem with the lens cover.  This problem did not affect the funcion, just won't close properly at this time""

"20110604","5.0","Great Camera","This is a fantastic camera.  I love its compact size.  It easily fits in my pocket.  I bought this camera so I could take both still images and hi-def movies.  The camera is easy to operate, and has an automatic mode for true worry free 'point and shoot', that gives you the perfect setting for any environment, or you can play with different settings yourself.  I was impressed with the movie quality.  The full 1080 movies look fantastic when you plug the camera directly in to an HDTV via the HDMI port.  It's almost like watching a blu-ray.  The only draw back is the movie image gets a little fuzzy if you zoom in too far.  Also, the stereo mics are prone to picking up wind noise.  Otherwise, the audio quality is quite good.  Overall, this is a fantastic camera for the money.  I'm very happy.""
"20110604","4.0","Love the camera cause it's very compact but...","Okay, the first camera I had sent back due to the fact that the lens would not retract back inside. Was replaced by amazon without any hassle.  The second camera the screen cracked within a month which was sad since now I am using a camera with a cracked screen. However, despite these mishaps, I have many reasons to really like the camera. First, the size is great as it is very small and easily fits into my pockets to carry around with me wherever I go. Second, the pictures are quite good despite the small size, low price and basic features. Are they the best pictures I have seen, absolutely not, but for a daily use camera that you toss in your pocket, they are fantastic, clear and vibrant.  Highly recommend despite having to return the first and the LCD screen cracking within a month. By the way, I called Canon support, the guy was friendly enough and he told me to send it in for repair and gave the the mailing address of some place in VA.  Surprisingly, the customer service guy couldn't tell me weather it was covered under warranty or not which I found kind of confusing. I may just take the gamble and send it in and hope they fix it or send me a new camera free of charge. I like Canon products so I am hoping they do the right thing. In the meantime, I am snapping photos almost every day and loving this little teeny tiny itty-bitty camera.""
"20110603","5.0","Robust features packed into a petite package.","Like many customers for things like this, I absorbed dozens of Amazon customer reviews and sought out video reviews of  the camera as well. So, I anticipated going in that this is a great little camera and have not been disappointed since it arrived about a month ago. About a day after receiving the camera, I mounted it to my helmet and took it on a favorite mountain biking trail here in southern California. Here's a short video the camera captured on that ride. The video I took is 720 HD, but this youtube video was bumped way down in resolution for ease of playback. Note, the last two clips of a water crossing are slow-motion, which is just as it was shot by the camera, which also shoots nice slow-motion (but, by design, the slo-mo it shoots is much lower resolution, which you'll notice). Oh, and the music is composed and played by my son! :)[...]I won't get technical, here, because lots of surrounding reviews do that nicely. This camera is loaded with features, many of which I'll likely never use. Things I like most: I can easily tailor it to my needs with a very intuitive onscreen menu, it'll shoot with or without a flash, it takes amazing photos, it's SILENT, so can be used on location for production stills during television shoots, it's SMALL, which makes it very easy to take along on any excursion, and it's easy to use. I have a Canon Rebel xti for special occasions, but I seldom use it. This little gem is just too proficient to leave home.  Hope this helps""
"20110601","3.0","I expected more from a Canon","I got this camera a week ago and have been disappointed.  I decided on Canon because I had one years ago and really liked it.  The quality seems to have gone downhill. The best feature is the compact size.  I find the 'smart auto' not to be so smart.  The images are usually over-exposed and at times out of focus.  It's as if the camera can't figure out what I want to photograph and instead picks some detail I'm not interested in.  The menus are not obvious and I have to keep running to the computer to read the manual, which is not very handy if I'm away from the computer.  I got this to replace an old HP digital camera that took great photos.  The image quality of the Canon is much worse.  I suspect that the HP had a much better quality lens.  The battery needs to be recharged after about 170 photos.  I haven't tried the video yet, but I suspect that will shorten the battery life even more.  I was used to taking 250-300 photos with my previous camera before changing the battery.  I read some reviews that said not to even bother with the smart auto mode and I think they are right.  I need to experiment with the 'P' mode to see if I can get some decent photos with this camera.  I had considered getting a cheaper model of the Canon powershot camera but opted for this more expensive one because of the extra feature.  I think the extra money was not well spent since the Canon ELPH 300 performs about as well as a camera costing half as much.  To be fair, I've only had the camera a week and there is a steep learning curve.  If things improve over the next few weeks, I'll add an update and may give this camera a higher rating.  At this time I'm feeling disappointed.Addendum (6/5/11): I've now had several more days to play with the camera and after trying all kinds of settings the picture quality is not much better.  I finally made some videos, which looked nice, but the microphones picked up a lot of extraneous noise even indoors in a quiet room and introduced a kind of background hum into the audio.  If the quality of sound doesn't matter to you, the videos are quite nice.  I've decided to keep the camera because it's so compact and I plan to take it on trips.  The photos are passable but nothing spectacular.  The problems with focusing and overexposure have continued.  I think the lens is just not as good quality as in previous cameras I've owned, including an old Canon.  Maybe the fault lies in me since I'm not an expert on photography. A friend who is a serious photographer offered to go over the camera with me, so after we get together I'll have a better idea.Addendum (6/24/11):  I had this camera for over 3 weeks now and have taken hundreds of photos with it.  My original impression has not changed.  It takes decent photos in general.  The AUTO feature is useless and needs to be avoided outdoors because it totally over-exposes the photos.  It's kind of ludicrous that you can't use the AUTO feature outdoors on a point and shoot camera.  Indoors the AUTO function is acceptable.  The Programable mode does a better job, and it's all that I use now.  Generally I'm disappointed with the quality of the images and It think this has to do with the cheap lens this camera uses.  As I said previously, it is nowhere near the quality of previous Canon cameras I have owned.  The best feature is the small size of the camera, so I will be keeping it and using it on vacations because it is so portable.""

"20110531","5.0","Awesome pocket camera!","Bought this item to replace an older, heavier Cannon PowerShot.  We LOVE this product - excellent pictures, very high quality case, really good zoom level, very light and slim, and absolutely rock solid picture quality! Flash can be a little over-bright at very short distances, and this camera isn't fantastic for taking super-close ups of busy items (especially flowers/plants), but it has a really great face finder, and even manages to capture animal and bird faces.  Focus is very quick, and the camera turns on very quickly, which is great for capturing quick shots.  High level of pixels means you will have to crop or adjust to load to web, but these quality snaps are going to look great.We are big fans of the Cannon PowerShot series, and this is yet another fantastic product in their line.""

I am very happy with mine.I don't like that most of those that knocked this camera start off by saying what other more expensive camera they have. It doesn't fine tune this or that the best, blah, blah, blah. If you're a photography snob or perfectionist then use your expensive camera and be done it.""
"20110527","2.0","Disappointing image quality","I own a Canon EOS 7D (DSLR) and an old SD400.  The SD400 is nearing its end, so I wanted a new small point and shoot to replace it.  I would never expect a new P&S to even approximate the quality of my 7D, but I'd certainly expect more out of a couple generations of PowerShots.Unfortunately, I'm disappointed and will be sending the ELPH 300 back.The good: It's very small, sturdy, and constructed well.  The handling is quite nice with a powder-coated metal frame.  It powers on quickly and the menus are fairly easy to navigate.  The video modes are nice, too, with the 120fps 640x480 mode and 240fps 320x240 mode.  I'd probably never use them, but they're cool.  The newer PowerShots also support SDHC, so they work great with my 8GB Eye-Fi SD card.  The SD400, unfortunately, doesn't support over 2GB.The bad: A new camera isn't worth it if it doesn't exceed the quality of my old 5Mpixel SD400 and this one doesn't.  The auto white balance is poor and doesn't compare the SD400 in either flash or no-flash modes.  With my EOS 7D, I'll shoot in RAW and do post processing in Lightroom, but the point of a P&S is to avoid those hassles.  I'd need to properly balance every picture taken so far with the ELPH 300.With 12 Mpixels, you'd expect pretty good images, but the problem is that the ELPH 300 compression is turned up so high that the sensor's acuity gets lost (softened) in compression.  Without a 'super-fine' mode or at least a higher-quality fine mode, the best simply isn't good enough.  The 5 Mpixel images from the SD400 come pretty close to the acuity of the ELPH's images and are 1/3 the size.""

"20110525","5.0","Best camera of this class. Period.","Well, its better than the Nikon coolpix 3100 that I retuned.  The Nikon did cost me $135 , so I cannot bash it too much just because of the  price.  The biggest quality is the clarity of the HD video, every detail can be seen ,  and yes you can optically zoom while  recording.  Not  like the Nikon which could only digitally zoomed.  Unlike the Nikon, the footage didn't loose quality  while zooming. ( Digital zoom decrease quality on both , pictures and videos )It also  takes great pictures , I know , Isn't that supposed to be the  priority lolMy biggest issue is that it takes a lot of memory for the full HD.  If you don't have at least a 16 GB, you might reconsider  recording in full HD.  I am talking about 555 MB for a 2:07 seconds videos. Yes , you read that right, 555 Megabytes for a two minutes and seven seconds full HD video.  I have two Sandisks SDHC class 10 , one 4GB and one 16GB, the 4GB was almost full before I knew it .  For  Those of you who  are wondering, yes it is fast , nowhere near like a rapid shooting SLR  camera, but with the class 10 , you will get the best for your  money. I was getting  2 second lag between shots.  It was perfect for me although some people might consider that as very slow . Compared to the Nikon I returned , that was a great improvement just in that area,  the Nikon was Slower.Also a little advice, not all SDHC class 10 are the same. From my researches (please forgive me if I am wrong) I could only find one brand that could do 30 MB/S maximum and it was Sandisk.  At least on Amazon .Update: If you turn the preview off, it will take up to a second for the camera to be ready between shots.  It now feels like a rapid fire SLR. Buy his camera, you won't be disappointed .""

However The canon with it's cmos sensor blows away my Panasonic in low light and it does HD video almost to par with a camcorder, Feels good in your hand too , slight sand texture on body makes it feel solid and expensive and easy to keep from slipping.

"20110515","2.0","Canon Quality Lacking","Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to try it out  as after a few hours I received the dreaded 'Lens Error' message, and it stopped working.I purchased the camera from another vendor, and I probably took about 10-20 indoor shots before the zoom lens broke. My observations are: very noisy ISO 400 and above, IS at 1/20 seems to be the threshold, picture quality quite dull and muted.I used center focus, and it did focusing, focus lock, recompose very well. The speed burst mode worked well too. In general, it's very responsive and the controls are well-planned. I'm just surprised how poor the images look. I will say, my other cameras are the 7D and the G11 so perhaps my expectations are too high. However, I did compare other photos I shot with my dinosaur Canon SD200, and they looked much better for a point & shoot. I really think they should continue to match/reduce megapixel count to the resolve power of the sensor.I've also researched the cryptic 'Lens Error' message and it looks like it's a very common problem with Canon point & shoots. Canon has a high failure rate amongst point & shoots, while others such as Panasonic (and I don't own any Panasonic cameras) have better quality controls.""

Never once dropped it but there was an internal software problem. Just sent it in to be fixed after owning it for 3 weeks. It works for 60 sec before a message comes up saying e3 error and then it shuts off. I've had 4 canon powershot cameras and this is my first time experiencing this type of problem but I trust canon and always come back to it. I always recommend canon over other makers and this is the first time I've had a problem with a canon camera that wasn't self-induced. It should be fine once it's fixed and shipped back to me. Theres a one year warranty and canon's customer service is very helpful. I'll always stick with canon.""
"20110514","5.0","Fantastic Little Camera","Pros: absolutely fantastic photos in low-light scenes like clubs, parties, and concerts; lots of fun features to keep you entertained (slow motion movies, miniature effect); records detailed 1080p video; fast, always ready, instant on; low noise, especially for a point and shoot; sharp pictures with punchy colors; HS system isn't marketing fluff, it works; teeny.Cons: jell-o effect (rolling shutter) in HD movies, which isn't the camera's fault, it's the nature of CMOS sensors; weird autofocus box tracking thing in auto; scratches like a bitch; screen could be higher resolution; the lens sits in this little ring that protrudes a tiny bit from the front of the camera, and dust collects in this ring like crazy, I have to use a tooth pick to dig it out; flash recycle times aren't incredibly fast.In short, if you need a camera that fits in your pocket (it's smaller than my BlackBerry) and can keep up with your life, get this. There's a few little things you could nitpick, but I dare you to find a better camera for the price.""
"20110514","4.0","Great Point and Shoot","This has got to be one of the best Point and Shoot cameras out there (and believe me, I've owned / tested a lot!).

"20110512","4.0","Love it!","I've had this camera for about 2 weeks now. I received it well within the timeframe specified by the shipper. I havent used the camera much but my initial reactions are:Pros:1. Very small and sleek: I used to have a canon powershot A95. So this is a welcome change. Fits very easily in my shirt pocket and really lightweight.2. Picture clarity: This is really good. Took about 30-40 pictures near the lake and experimented with the different scene settings [foliage] - I can see the difference clearly.Cons:The LCD screen is quite large [compared to the A95] and is always open. So I get a little worried about fingerprints and smudges. I am trying to find some sort of a cover for this similar to what I have for my iPhone.I think the lens is wider than that A95, so pictures taken when I am about 10 paces from the subject seems to include a lot of area around the subject. In fact I love that it has a wide-angle lens.To me, neither of these two 'cons' are a deal-breaker.I plan to experiment more in the coming weeks, so I will be updating this review in about 3-4 weeks.Bottomline: If you are looking for an affordable, sleek, lightweight camera with really good results, go for it! I love canon.""
"20110512","4.0","Creates .MOV Videos","I've owned several Canon Powershots and all have recorded videos in .AVI format.  I purchased this today and shot a sample video.  I then learned to my dismay that the video was recorded in .MOV format, not .AVI.  I've read many reviews on this product but didn't see that fact mentioned.  So for any of you that prefer AVI format, be warned.Also, for anyone who dislikes the rough, sandpapery finish on the black model, the red model has a smooth finish.""
"20110512","4.0","Great size and video, poor image quality","I bought this camera after reading all the positive reviews here. Overall, I can say that I'm kinda satisfied given that I wanted a small pocket-sized camera that takes good video WITH optical zoom. I wasnt really looking for or expecting great photos.PROS :1. It fits into my purse beautifully, is light and doesnt weigh down my purse (with all the other junk inside it), and form factor is wonderfully portable. Moms : you will love this! :-)2. Video with optical zoom on a small point and shoot!! Yoohoo! This is the main reason I bought it. Of course, you have to hold the camera very steady otherwise there is video-shake, but that is to be expected since this is such a tiny camera. I like the slow 5X optical zoom, because it doesnt cause jumpy video. So far, I've taken lots of video of my kid using this, and quality is very acceptable for my standards (which are not very high).CONS :1. The photos that I've taken so far are really disappointing. I have read other reviews saying they got very good pics, so that is leading me to wonder if I'm doing something wrong here. I cant beleive that a Canon would take grainy pics (even in broad daylight, shooting in Auto mode with largest resolution). Not that I'm expecting DSLR quality, mind you, but I was really surprised at the lack of color richness and sharpness. Can someone please let me know if I'm missing something here? I've owned a Nikon Coolpix point and shoot in the past which took way better photos than this one.Overall, since it meets my specific needs, I'm keeping this camera. But if someone is looking for an all-in-one point and shoot that takes both good pics and video, then look elsewhere!""

"20110508","5.0","excellent pocket camera","I bought this to have a small pocket size camera when I didn't want to bring along my higher-end Canon DSLR.After taking many shots and small video clips I am very impressed-just what I was looking for!.  The size is fantastic for travel or slipping in your purse/pocket, and easy to take quick shots without drawing attention (like a bigger camera).  I love the red color since it's easy to see and doesn't show fingerprints.  The pictures are all very sharp, zoom is great for most common purposes and videos are crisp.  The shutter isn't super fast like my high end camera, but for a everyday pocket camera it is more than fine.  easy to use, good battery and easy to transfer photos.  highly recommend!!...solid choice for a pocket camera.  Got in 2 days with my Amazon Prime.""
"20110507","4.0","Good camera with some very nice bonuses","Needed a replacement for my Canon SD750, and this seems to be just fine.Thing that most impressed me is the video mode, with various quality options, but MAINLY actual OPTICAL zoom during recording, and it uses some special technique where the zoom works slower, but it doesnt make noise or vibration, thus not interfering with the recording - very nice ! Will be interesting to compare it to my Canon D60 video capability [when  I get it back]m since DSLRs don't have this nice mechanical smooth zoom functionLow light photos are pretty good also, impressive. General image quality seems to ok, but I still need to do some deeper analysis.The physical layout is pretty  basic and simple, nothing special... the outside does feel like light sandpaper as others have stated, but I guess that good, so theres no risk of it slipping out of your hands.Anyway, haven't had much time to play with it yet, and if any new facts come up I'll update this post, but very happy with it for now !""
"20110505","3.0","Good Features, Bad finish","The 300 HS has good features and takes good photos. However, after about 4 days of use, it has developed numerous small radial dents in the bezel around the lens.  This is rather troublesome for long term durability.  The camera has been carried in my pocket and has been treated very well.  I think Canon skimped on the finish and metal thickness of the bezel. Also the black finish around the bezel is easily mared.  It's a great little camera in terms of features and photo quality, but I am considering returning it because of the issues stated above.  I would think very carefully about purchasing this camera.  See the review of the 300 HS at www.steves-digicams.com.  He has similar conerns about dents in the bezel.  Unfortunatly, I did not read Steve's review until after I purchased the camera.  I am very disappoined in Canon on this issue.  By the way, I have owned at least 25 digital cameras over the last 8 years (70% Canons) I have not seen an issue like this before.  I believe that this is a design defect which could eventually effect picture quality.""

"20110503","5.0","Traded in my Sony DSC-TX5 for this. Couldn't be happier!","I just sold my Sony DSC-TX5 because I was not happy with the image quality. I've played with the new DSC-TX10 and the image quality is pretty much identical to my DSC-TX5. The Sony is a fairly highly rated compact camera but about 40% of the images turned out somewhat blurry, simply lacking sharpness, even in bright light conditions. The Sony does have a lot of nice features such as the 10 feet waterproof, panorama, and low light mode, but what's the use if you have to delete 40% of the pics you take??Getting back to this camera, I am indeed very impressed with it! Images are crystal clear. This is true even when I take side shots while rollerblading! Hand-held night shots are pretty impressive too. Video is great quality (although it eats card space fast). Camera is fast, responsive, and very compact (fits in your jeans no problem). Love the textured coating! I had the Canon SD790IS before and I was looking for something that could give me the same quality of pictures but perhaps smaller and with a wider lens. This is it!Only drawback is that sound quality in video is not great. The microphones seem to be very sensitive and even when you're recording in silence, there's a constant sound of static in the video. I suspect, it would fail miserably in a club setting. All in all, a solid Canon product! Got mine off BestBuy actually (made in Japan!)""
"20110427","5.0","Does everything well","I bought the 300HS to be my sole photo and video camera. A trip to Disney and 400+ photos & video clips later, I declare it a success. This camera does everything well.With the 300HS, shots that should be easy are easy and they come out well. For shots that are difficult you can switch to manual mode and pick one of several presets for different conditions, or go fully manual and set the exposure, etc. directly. Every shot you'd expect a point & shoot to take, the 300HS takes well. As light levels go down, image quality degrades gracefully -- there are no surprises. The shutter is responsive enough and the camera & flash recycle quickly enough for most uses. I've found no annoying quirks with this camera, it seems to do everything well.For me, this camera replaces a Canon SD1400is that fortunately I broke just in time for the trip. Yes, fortunately. The 300HS is just a minor step up on paper, but everything works so much better -- the images are much sharper, the colors are better, no focusing problems, you can zoom during a video, and it refocuses as the subject moves during a video.Like all Canon Elphs, the camera easily fits in a shirt pocket. The 300HS has a textured finish that makes it less likely to slip out of said pocket.One nice feature is separate buttons for taking a still photo vs. recording a video, so you don't accidentally start a video when you think you're taking a photo and vice versa. A cool feature is slow motion video -- great for analyzing a runner's stride, a golf swing, or just for fun.Minor complaints: You can trim a video clip but there's no way to join two adjacent video clips. The microphones are on the top edge of the camera so I often accidentally cover them with my finger. The 10-minute HD recording limit may prevent you from videoing your kid's school play (though 640x480 records up to an hour). The battery ran down when I used the camera all day, but it's a standard size and aftermarket batteries are cheap; I carry a couple I had left over from my previous Elph. The camera doesn't come with a memory card (I use a Sandisk Ultra 16gb type 4, though type 6 is recommended).Overall the Canon Elph 300HS has great specs, takes great pictures and videos, and is a pleasure to use. You should buy one.""
"20110423","5.0","Canon PowerShot ELPH 300","This is a great camera,  small, easy-to-use and takes very good quality photos and good on the video.This is the fifth canon compact  digital camera that I have owned and without a doubt is the best.  The picture quality is very good on macro, zoom can be a little grainy if you don't have a stable platform to take the photo from.Quite a number of my photos are aerial shots from the helicopter and I find sometimes the delay between taking photos can miss the preferred shot, it's a matter of judging your timing and speed.The video shots I have taken have tended to be a little jumpy but I believe that was me, I need to keep the camera more stable when filming.Overall I'm very happy with the camera, takes great photos and is good value for money.""
"20110421","5.0","Great SLR  companion","I bought this as a companion to my D90. It takes great pictures and is the perfect go-anywhere replacement for my trusty, 5-year-old Elph. Super slim and slip-resistant finish. Fast lens and CMOS sensor takes great low-light photos without flash.I originally bought a Powershot S95 but returned it. The S95 is not as pocket-able, does not zoom while shooting video and doesn't shoot 1080p. I miss the custom settings of the S95, but it's an acceptable tradeoff for the 300 HS's small size and simplicity.I also returned a Panasonic Lumix ZS6 that someone got me for Christmas. The menu system and slow lens/indoor shooting in the Lumix is terrible (in my opinion).Negatives: The lens isn't THAT fast: you'll still have blurry shots of fast-moving kids indoors unless you turn the flash on. Scene selection in the menu system seems awkward.Overall, the 300 HS is an excellent camera. I am glad I returned the S95 and ZS6.""
"20110419","1.0","Poor image quality","EDIT #2 (December 2011). I become more and more disappointed in this camera as time goes by. Just reviewed loads of photos from this summer/fall and I hate to say it, but -- they suck! My former Canon AS1100 (vintage 2008) took photos soooooo much better than thing. Interior shots are especially bad, whether flash is used or not. I figured to take this camera on a long international journey, but forget it. The photos are that disappointing. I did take the AS1100 on a long international journey (six months in Africa) and its photos were awesome. One even won a photo contest. The AS1100 hd a CCD sensor and the Elph 300 a CMOS -- that's the thing.So, I guess I'll be shopping for a new camera in the next few months. :(EDIT: I originally gave this 5 stars. Well, after shooting many photos under a variety of conditions during a recent vacation, I have to drop it to 4 stars. Using the camera's Auto mode, on many shots, the image quality is poor to mediocre. I assumed Auto mode image quality would be superior to the last two (and less expensive) Nikon and Canon point and shoots I have owned, but that is definitely not the case. Auto mode images tend to be soft and faint and not realistic, e.g., grass is a faint green, not the rich green of healthy grass. Pretty disappointing! To get the most from this camera, you have to use Program mode and set ISO at 100 or 200, and experiment with the manual white balance settings. Then photos come out much better, with improved quality and richness and color accuracy. Unfortunately, the camera doesn't allow you to apply custom ISO and WB settings to various scene modes, like Foliage or Fisheye.ORIGINAL: One of the best things about this camera is its 24 mm wide angle lens. This is wider than the 28mm lens that is standard on most pocket-sized point and shoots (and the Elph 100, a step down from the Elph 300) and it is very cool. If you're not familiar with how 24 mm vs. 28 mm compares, do a little Googling. It's outstanding for landscape shots and group shots and makes photos more engaging and descriptive, with no downside. Great move, Canon!The small size of the camera is fantastic. Pocketability and performance are very nicely balanced in this well built and well designed camera. It was good to see Canon back out of the megapixel war and reduce the megapixels on this model to 12.1, from 14 in its predecessor (the SD 1400). With the 5x optical zoom, CMOS sensor (vs. CCD), HD video and an impressive palette of shooting options, there's a lot to like in this little gem.One peculiarity is that the volume on video playback on the camera is extremely low. It's difficult to hear if you're playing back videos on the camera. It's a lot lower than another Canon point and shoot that I used for a few years. I think I have it adjusted to the max, though I have to take a closer look at the manual. Which leads me to ...Raspberries to Canon for not including a full user manual booklet. Since when has it become acceptable to sell a product without providing the customer with an easy means of learning how to use it? (I know, lots of mfr's do it but still). I travel extensively for months on end with a point and shoot and refer to the manual fairly often. If I want to look up some detail or just browse, I could just grab the manual from my pack over a cup of coffee. Does Canon expect me to lug around a printout of the full PDF manual? It's not always convenient to have a netbook running and use the manual on it. Nor is it as enjoyable or instructive as flipping through a book.Though I can see some logic in not providing a full booklet and am all for not wasting paper, I would be happy if Canon made available for purchase a proper user manual for $10 or $12 or whatever.""
"20110409","5.0","Great Little Camera","I was interested in the Flip HD pocket video camera or the Kodak Playsport. Then I came across a Youtube video by 'The World According to Jon' where he argues against purchasing a pocket video camera. Instead he recommended buying a *real* digital camera with video capability. I followed his advice, and after several days of painstaking research, I finally decided to buy a Canon Elph 300 HS.Size:I went to a brick and mortar store, and was shocked to know how tiny this camera really is. It is almost like the size of a credit card, and almost as thin as a smartphone. It is very light and very pocketable.Build:I bought the black unit. It has this anti-slip, gritty feel to it. I appreciate this tiny nuance to avoid accidental slippage. The camera body is metal and not plastic. It feels good in your hands and it looks pricy rather than cheap. It looks very stylish and hip too.Features:I'm amazed how Canon was able to squeeze tremendous features into a camera this tiny. It has features available only to more expensive and larger digital cameras.Price:This camera is way *UNDERPRICED* ... but don't tell Canon about it. BTW, I got mine on sale at BB for $20 off retail.Performance:I ordered two 8-gigs SDcard from Amazon which has not arrived yet. So, I used an old Sandisk 2-gigs, class 2 SDcard. I used the Smart AUTO function and took pictures in low light (only the light from my computer monitor in a darkened room). The quality of the pics was very good. I took a few seconds of 1080p video hoping that my Canon won't choke. I was amazed that the Canon took a 1080p video although the quality was a little bit grainy (in very low light). I took several pics underneath flourescent lighting in the gym, and the pics were excellent. Flesh tones were true and not saturated.One of my favorite features so far, is the Movie Digest. If you select this feature, this little Canon will take a few seconds of video before it takes a picture. So at the end of the day, you can stitch together a full-length video show out of the few seconds of video snippets. Simpy amazing !!!!!I'm still exploring the various features of my tiny Canon. I'm like a kid playing with a new toy I just unwrapped under my Christmas tree. It is Christmas in April.Conclusion:If time is priceless, then this camera is a good investment because it captures and freezes moments extremely well that would have otherwise been lost forever.I have absolutely no regrets with this purchase. It is money well-spent and the ROI is mind-boogling. This little camera is way beyond my most optimistic expectations.""

If you are looking for a pocket point and shot, this is a Great Camera.""
"20110402","3.0","Not a bad little camera but some things need improving","I bought this to replace my old A590IS. I also have a good canon HD video camera and a Nikon D40 dslr. I'm going to Florida in a week and wanted a great point and shoot that could do it all. I was going to only use the 300 HS and keep my video camera and DSLR at home. I did a lot of research and bought the ELPH 300 HS. I'm impressed with the features and the speed it can take photos. However I'm disappointed at the size of the videos, audio and very short battery life. I set the camera to 720P and recorded myself playing guitar for 10 minutes. I then loaded it onto my computer and noticed it took up 1.62GB of space. I compared this to a 10 minute 1080 video from my canon HD video camera and that only took up 800mb. There is no excuse why the 300 HS has to take up twice as much space on a ten minute video. For example the new flip video HD will record 2 Hours of HD video on only 8GB. If you recorded 2 hours on the 300HS at 720P (not even the highest setting) your looking at about 20GBs.  Also there should not be a time limit of ten minutes for the videos. It should let you continue recording until the memory card is full (I have a 32GB card in the camera). On the plus side the video looks great, the camera focuses great and I like the slow zoom when recording. Now the thing that bothers me more then the size of the video is the static sound. It actually picks up sound very good with no distortions but there is what I can only describe as a water fall sound in the background during my videos (and there was no other sounds in the room that would cause this). I can not use this camera to record my guitar lessons or demos seeing as the water fall sound just kills it. I also only got about 150 pictures and just a few videos before the battery went dead. I do have another one I keep with me but this seems a little fast. If canon could fix the static/waterfall sound during recording, bring down the file size of the videos and kick up the battyer life a little this would be a perfect little camera.""
"20110330","5.0","Power in a small camera","I have wanted a camera for some time that could take decent low-light photos and 1080p hi-def video.  I thought I'd have to go with a bulky Four-Thirds camera or an SLR.  But the CMOS sensor in the 300HS does a nice job in low light.  It would be interesting if someone could do a side-by-side test to see how close this camera comes to, say, the Panasonic DMC-GH1K in this respect.  I also like the multiple-frames-per-second stills (even faster at 3 megabytes).  The 24mm (equivalent) lens is free of fish-eye distortion (except in extreme close-ups where you might actually want it), perhaps due to computed correction within the camera.It is a bit inconvenient to switch between functions because the buttons and the screen icons are small.  Although a rotating function dial like the ones that Panasonic and Fuji use would make switching easier, clearly there isn't room for one on a camera this small.  If the camera is to fit in a pocket this is one of the necessary trade-offs.I had been concerned that the 300HS would be significantly larger than the SD780IS it replaced, but no worries.  The difference in thickness, the most important dimension for me in a pocket camera, is not significant.  So here is this little gem with 5X optical zoom, optical image stabilization, fast frame rate, hi-def video, and good low-light capability, and it all fits in a pocket!  Don't tell Canon but they aren't charging enough for this camera.""
"20110330","4.0","Great Camera with a rough finish","I have not had the camera for long (2 weeks) but so far it's great.Pros:-Very compact.-Great video and photo quality.-Wide angle lens is the best and now a must in all my future point and shoot cameras.-Miniurature scene mode is fun to use-Slow motion video is also great.-Compact battery charger is genius when you compare to the charger I have for my Nikon (bulky charger with a 3 foot cord/ a pain in the rump to pack when travelling light).-Power on and ready to shoot is super fastCons:-getting to a scene mode in a hurry is difficult.  Once you get the hang of it you get faster but still not ideal.-Rough finish on Black model (see more below)-Wrist strap does not tighten-up like my old Canon SD450 did.-mini usb cover looks weak (be gentle on it)I had to write this primarily because while researching the camera I was never made aware that the black Elph 300 HS has a very textured feeling.  At the end of a long winter here in Montreal my wife and I have quite dry hands and the feeling of the (slightly rough) textured finish is well kinda Icky feeling.  I can't describe how it feels except it's a slightly like holding a piece of sand paper.  Something you get used to after a few minutes but noticable after you haven't held the camera for a few hours. I hope the summer months will soften my hand and therefore the feeling.I would have prefered that black rubberized finish that you see alot on other devices such as my BB Bold, or the smooth finish you find on the silver model.However this roughly textured finish will certainly give you a better grip on the camera and help prevent you from dropping it.""
"20110329","5.0","Another great Canon product!","I currently own a 5D Mark II and was looking to replace my Canon S80 which is now 6 yrs old. While I love the S80 and the quality pics it captured, the bulkiness of this point-and-shoot (P&S) became inconvenient. My wife was adamant she wanted a more compact P&S this time around.In addition to great pics, I was looking for a P&S with 1080p video capability so I wouldn't have to get a separate camcorder. Let me say that the 300 HS is a quality camera packed into a sleek body that I can easily slip into any pocket on the run.Most Canon cameras (I am a Canon loyalist) take great shots. But what most impresses me about this camera are its low-light capabilities.  It obviously can not match the image quality of a DSLR, but for a P&S, I was impressed!  Indoor night shots of my kids WITHOUT flash (incandescent lighting only) come out amazingly crisp with minimal noise. Autofocus is quite impressive as it tracks faces in the frame further enhancing ease of use. Menu functions are quite intuitive (if you've owned previous Canon models). It's got plenty of preset shooting modes. And it's quick between shots for a P&S (a couple seconds with flash photography).I also compared the 1080p video vs Flip Ultra HD which shoots in 720p. The video quality is like night-and-day with the 300 HS finishing ahead by a mile. Low-light video is grainy but still watchable (unwatchable on Flip). In daylight, video looks beautiful. Video is easily imported into both iphoto and imovie.  Just make sure you have a large memory card as 1080p takes up 16GB/hour of video.  I bought a 32GB card.I did purchase an extra battery after reading battery life can be short. I've had the camera a week and have used it for 15-30 minutes daily (including video capture) and I have not needed to recharge yet.I'd also recommend the black body as it has a textured housing that makes holding this small camera much easier.Also purchased a Caselogic TBC - 302 compact camera case which fits this camera perfectly.  It has a small side pocket that I slip the extra battery in.Overall, considering the excellent quality of the camera, easy portability, and great price, this camera is worth every penny.""
"20110324","5.0","Best camera I have had yet!","I needed a camera that was small but took clear clean pictures and video. The Cannon ELPH 300HS delivers! I looked around for a while before making my mind and I am so glad I took my time. I have a two and four year old who are very active and we take lots of trips so I wanted something that was going to catch all the action but was still small enough to take around with me all the time. This camera is perfect for everyday picture taking and the full HD 1080p video with the HDMI hook up is a huge plus! Great camera for a great price!!""
"20110322","5.0","So far, amazed","Got it today. Taking pictures & video in low light. I'm very impressed - this is MUCH better than your camera phone, will make you forget Flip Video forever, and is tiny, tiny, tiny. Macro photos in low light, obscenely good. In twilight, flash off, snapped a photo of my computer keyboard, and saw an eyelash on my 'option' key (that's 'alt' key for Windows folk).Let me say it again, in low light this camera is amazing.Build quality is excellent, buttons are large enough for western fingers, and it's undeniably cute. Adorable even.My goal was to get something pocketable that would do better than my iPhone 4 for still pix. Check for sure. Replace my Flip HD. Check (and then some).I have a Canon G10 which takes awesome photos in good light. And shoots raw. And my rm has a Sony NEX5 which is even better. But the G10 is heavy, so I don't bring it. And the NEX5 isn't mine.I've bought other compact digicams in the past, but they have been so BAD compared to bigger ones. This one is quite amazing, a tiny bit of a compromise, but not by much. I'm finally happy with a compact digicam. You can slip it in your pocket just like a cellphone.""
"20110321","5.0","Trade up to this very nice camera","There were five things that attracted me to replace my ELPH 1100IS (which I consider one of the best of the point-and-shoots at its time) with the 300 HS: 12 MP, 24mm wide angle, 5x zoom, Image Stabilization, and new High Sensitivity CMOS sensor.  Lesser features were the HD movie mode and burst still shots.  The camera delivers all these very well except the 12MP, which I'll get to later.  The controls are slightly different from the traditional ELPH cameras.  The 300 HS has a dedicated movie button (so you don't accidentally take a movie in the middle of the old slide control), and a dedicated Review button (which allows you to switch back and forth between the Shooting and Review mods much more easily).  There is a mode 'switch' to select between AUTO, and Manual.Strangely, I get higher resolution pictures with the AUTO mode than any of the (MANY) Manual modes.  For example, in the Best Image Selection mode, I get a resolution of 900 Line Widths per Picture Height, where in the AUTO mode I get 2,000 LW/PH.  This is due manly to the Best Image Selection pictures being shot at 1984 x 1488 instead of 4000 x 3000 pixels.  However, with the 1100 IS I got 1,800 LW/PH.  Mathematically, the 12MP 300HS should have gotten 22% better resolution than the 8MP 1100IS, but only gets about 11% better resolution.  Maybe this is because the relatively small lens of the point-and-shoot cannot resolve the pixels on the chip.Image Stabilization seems to be improved over the 1100, and the CMOS sensor is noticeably more sensitive than the 1100IS.  This (and the improved IS) result in sharper pictures in low light, because they are taken at higher shutter speeds and ISO levels.There a few 'gotchas'.  The rocker switch is slightly recessed and harder to operate.  To select ISO Lock (for taking panorama pictures) one must first select the Manual switch, activate the Function Set, and select the Program mode.  All this was not required in the 1100IS.  One can read my test procedures at [...]All in all, this camera takes really good pictures.""
"20110319","5.0","Wonderful compact camera with hd video","I'm a DSLR photographer who shoots professionally and has managed a camera store in the past. I wanted something I can take with me everywhere but still produces good quality shots. I also wanted a camera that could shoot good looking videos. I researched several models and after much deliberation decided on the Canon 300 HS. I'm very happy I did.Image Quality:I tested cameras and lenses all the time while managing the camera store so whenever I purchase a new camera or lens I always test it. The Canon 300 HS doesn't produce the quality of images my Nikon D7000 does but I didn't expect it to. The edges get a little soft with the 300 HS when looking at the image at 100% whereas the D7000 images are almost tact sharp.Comparing the 300 HS to the Canon Powershot SD1000 from a few years ago, the 300 HS blows it out of the water. The SD1000 is a 7 MP camera. Shooting the same shots on a tripod with the same focal length on the lens the 300 HS uses its extra MPs well. When looking at the images from each camera at 100%, at the wide angle zoom setting and normal zoom setting both cameras have about the same relative slight softness on the edges. However the 300 HS has more MP so it actually produces much more detail in the image. I think it was smart for Canon to keep the MP at 12 because last years models while being 14 MP (SD1400) didn't give any extra detail from what I could tell than the 12 MP version (SD1300). The SD1400 was basically just creating larger files. When zooming in the telephoto setting the 300 HS clearly produced a sharper image than the SD1000. Often cameras have sweet spots in the zoom range in which it will produce crisper images. The 300 HS has consistently good sharpness throughout it's zoom range.HS system and ISO:The image processing with the HS system truly works to reduce noise at higher ISOs enabling people to produce better quality images in low light. The improvement in image quality gets more and more visible the greater and greater the ISO. ISO 400 with the 300 HS was almost as good as ISO 200 on the SD1000. ISO 800 on the 300 HS was a tad better than ISO 400 on the SD1000. ISO 1600 on the 300 HS was between ISO 400 and 800 on the SD1000. ISO 3200 on the 300 HS produced the same quality of image (noise) as ISO 800 on the SD1000. A 2 stop in film speed improvement is big.1080p video and slow motion:With good light, the 300 HS produces wonderful smooth 1080 videos. If you look at a lot of HD videos from compact cameras the video often looks jumpy. From what I've seen it wasn't until you got to the Canon G12 or Panasonic LX5 that the video looked smooth. Both of those cameras only shoot 720p whereas this camera shoots 1080p. The video also very good detail. It truly looks HD.If you are wanting zoom and continuous AF with your video this camera is the one you want compared to the 100 HS which doesn't allow you to zoom. The continuous AF with face recognition is stellar with this camera in video mode. I was videoing my wife while she was driving. It focused on her face. I switched to the scenery outside. It immediately focused on that. I then went back to my wife and it found her face and focused on it right away. I even videoed her reflection in the rear view mirror and it found her face in the mirror no problem and focused on it. AMAZING!!!!Commenting on a complaint I've read about the zoom being slow in video mode. If you like getting motion sickness whenever someone rapidly zooms in or out during their video this is not your camera. As smooth looking as the video is, the zoom is also. The smooth zoom creates nice looking transitions instead of warp speed ahead looks.The slow motion is a fun feature that works well. You need to have good lighting though. In low light even with high ISO's it produced very dark videos. In a review someone commented that it should have sound with the slow motion video. I honestly don't know how that could work unless you want to listen to everything at 1/5 it's normal speed. I think it's a good thing that it doesn't have sound with the slow motion videos.AF:I commented on AF partially in the video portion of the review. It does have several AF modes for various situations. The face detection works great. If you have a person in the picture but want something other than the person to be in focus you will need to change AF modes from face detection. The reviewer that had the problem with the 300 HS focusing on things he didn't want the camera to focus on likely didn't have the correct AF mode for the shooting situations. The 300 HS does have a center AF if you prefer that.Areas for Canon to improve on with the 300 HS:The camera is so well thought out that I'm surprised Canon let this slip. I love having a wide angle zoom go down to 24mm. It's great for scenery and photojournalist type shots. If you shoot at the widest angle zoom and use the flash, the lens on the 300 HS blocks the flash's exposure on the bottom right corner of the image. The corner is completely black. If you zoom in a bit so you aren't at the widest angle setting when using the flash you will be fine. Still all Canon had to do is not put the flash so close to the lens.When shooting video in lower light situations the video does start to get noisy and grainy quicker than some other cameras.Conclusion:All in all this is a wonderfully thought out camera with great image quality and image processing and it shoots stellar videos for it's compact size.""
"20110319","5.0","Great camera if it's what you're looking for","I've only had it for a couple days now, but I can honestly say this camera was worth every penny so far. It has a lot of interesting features, and is the only camera I have found that hits all the strong points I was looking for (120 fps @ 640x480 resolution, full 1080 hd video, optical zoom and auto focus during movie recording, strong low-light performance, good image stabilization, and small form factor [very small. much smaller than other cameras like it that I was considering])Other things of note: I have Photoshop, and use it regularly, so I wasn't looking for a camera that can do everything by itself. This camera cannot shoot hdr pictures by itself like the Exilim ZR-10 or 100 can, nor can it take panoramic pictures all by itself. It does have a 'panorama helper' kind of application, which will help you line up the shots, but you must then use software later to merge them (it comes with software, compatible with both mac and pc, that will help you merge photos, as well as sort through them and manage them, but I find that Photoshop does a much better job than the packaged software does at creating panoramas. I also use the HDR toning option on Photoshop to simulate an actual HDR picture. As long as all the details are there (not blown out or too dark to brighten), PS can create a very convincing HDR picture, and this camera does a good job at getting all the detail in pictures.It also doesn't take the fastest pictures (around 3 per second) on continuous mode, but I rarely (if ever) take more than 1 picture at a time. I may take pictures in succession, but I generally set each one up, rather than just shotgunning a bunch of pictures.The pictures are very sharp. I haven't had much time with video or sound yet, but the little that I have played around with it produced pretty good results. (altho sound can get very distorted with windy sound in a windy environment, as many camera's microphones can. still thinking about/searching for a remedy...)Also, just a little side note, the finish on the camera is left a bit rough. This is a good thing, as it gives the camera more grip, and makes it less likely to slip out of your hand. I have used cameras that were shiny and slippery before, and it make taking pictures with one hand much more difficult and risky. The rough texture keep this camera more firm in your hand. This also makes the camera less prone to finger prints, altho the screen will collect plenty of those (but that has never really bothered me much)Just a couple knocks against it that I have found so far, but they are not deal breakers for me. It says that it can take pictures with shutter speeds between 1/2000s and 15s. This may be true, but it is not user choosable. You cannot set the shutter speed of the camera. It has options for 'Longer Exposure' (or something named like that), but does not let you choose the speed. I have not gotten it to hit a 15 second exposure yet. I was thinking of trying a city scene on a tripod where you set the exposure long so that the car lights look like streaks, but it doesn't seem to stay open long enough.Also, the zoom doesn't seem to be variable, it goes at one speed, and it's pretty fast, so sometimes it can be hard to hit that sweet spot if you are trying to get a shot somewhere in the middle (5x zoom, which I think is very reasonable for it's size), and optical zoom is pretty slow while recording video, but still an option, which is more than many cameras of this type can say. The battery may also be a tad short (especially if doing a lot of video and/or zooming in and out, but that will shorten the life all camera batteries), but they are pretty small, and you can get extra, generic batteries for very cheap.There is no way to plug in the camera to a wall for continuous shooting/video, so you need to replace the battery when it dies. However, I have seen the option of having a battery stand-in that sits in the battery slot and runs a line down to an adapter that plugs into the wall, but this will require you to leave the battery door open while using it)For everything your getting, I think this camera is well worth $250. It takes sharp, accurately colored pictures look great on their own, as well as with Photoshop. If you do not own any imaging editing software, this camera still produces great pictures, has a ton of very cool, very interesting modes (some of which I've never seen on any camera before), and comes with some simple editing software (mainly for merging panorama shots. there is also other, free image editing software out there on the internet if you are so inclined)Edit:You CAN choose the shutter speed, it's just not as simple to find as some of the other options. You have to go into program mode, choose the Long Shutter option. Exit program mode. When you're back to the normal screen, press the up button (+/-). From there, you can choose the shutter speed by pressing right and left. Glad to find the option!""
"20110317","5.0","Some first impressions","So far I'm really enjoying this camera. I've had it for two days now so I'm giving my first impressions. As time goes by, I'll flesh out my review. And this point of view is from someone who has only used point and shoot cameras, by the way. :)Why I bought it - I wanted a more powerful point and shoot camera. I'm still very much a novice photographer but I do like having quality shots, especially for such events as weddings, graduations, bdays, and everyday outings. Originally I wanted the S95 but saw that the new PS ELPH 300 HS had comparable specs and was powerful but still had a simple design. $250 is the most I've paid for a camera but also cheaper than the S95. Nonetheless, I saw this purchase a long term investment of sorts!Design layout - the black model looks sleek, is thin and very pocketable. It doesn't weigh down my purse at all. It has a rougher material design rather than the smooth metal surface I'm used to, which is a nice change. I feel like a get a better grip on the camera which is already so small. Overall, I like the design.Button layout - Having owned two digital cameras in the past (Sony and Fujifilm) I didn't have a hard time figuring out what buttons do and the menu system. Low learning curve overall. And nothing reading through the manual can't help. :)Image/video quality - I've been playing with the different effects (fisheye and miniature are cool), video shooting (1080p HD and you can zoom during filming), macro mode, different aspect ratios (square mode, 16:9), indoor, outdoor, flash, etc. Very happy/impressed with the quality. Shots turn out very clear and crisp and you can see a lot of detail in the photographs- even in macro mode, which has been terrible in my old cameras!To be continued. Again, I'll flesh out my review as time goes on.So far, I really like this camera!""
"20110314","5.0","Awesome Point and Shoot","This is a point and shoot class camera, if you understand that going in, you are going to be more than impressed with it. I'm going from an SD630 and hands down, this beats it. I even had an SX210IS and these images are on par with it, if not better. I had to return my SX210IS as it had issues with dust on the image sensor and I've been waiting for a new P&S class to come out. I bit the bullet on this camera and what can I say - I am happy!300HS vs 500HS:There is a 500HS version of the camera, which is approx $50 more. To this point, the only differences I can tell are the LCD on the back as well as aperture priority and shutter priority, while the 300hs does not. The touch screen on the 500hs can also be used to focus on a particular subject. The 500hs also has a wider aperture at 2.0, the 300hs has 2.7.Form Factor/Display:Small. Awesome. There is a texture on the camera, I really like this as it seems like it will help if you hands are wet (sweat, snow, etc). Easy to operate one hand and if using both hands, flash isn't in a horrible place. Display is very bright and button seem intuitive as with other Canon cameras. Battery and SD are on the bottom door, USB and HDMI are in a covered side port. Comes with a wrist strap if you desire a little extra security.Boot Time/Software:Camera is ready to take photos very fast. From the time you press the button, it's pretty much set to catch the action. Time between photos wasn't terrible (about 1.5 seconds) and if you need it, there is continuous shot mode. Had no problem with the Canon software on Windows 7. I've used the Canon Photo Window import for a while, does a good job of getting photos off the camera without duplicates. I use Picasa to then manage my photo library (I skip the Zoom Browser, but it's really not bad if you want to use it, I'm just a slave to Google/gmail)Computer Connectivity:I didn't find this anywhere in the specs, so if you're looking, the camera uses mini-USB, similar to all Canon's that have come out over the last few years.Optical Zoom:You're going to be impressed with the form factor of this camera and it's 5x OPTICAL zoom. I immediately disabled digital zoom as 12.1MP + 5x Optical will get you very close to the action. You're better off digitally enhancing the photos later on.Battery + Memory Card:This uses the NBL-4 (again, I found confusion on this and accessories) - so if you have some of those laying around keep them as they'll work just fine in this camera. This is nice as my SD630 uses the NBL-4 so now I have 2 chargers + 3 batteries. It took my 16GB SDHC (Sandisk Ultra) without any issues and holds thousands of images. Images have tended to be between 2 and 3mb on the highest settings.Image Quality:Look, I'm no photo fanatic, I don't expect the people buying this camera are. I am looking for solid images and this camera delivers. There are a ton a feature you can delve into and I'm sure they are good. It has manual mode, so if you fancy that, you can go down that path. But I'm the type of person that knows when something looks good, OK or great. This camera consistently delivers GREAT photos. I'm happy with the low light and images aren't blurry or grainy (within reasonable expectations).Video:FINALLY! Optical zoom on a Canon during video! 1080p brings this camera up to par with others in its class and it does a decent job. I didn't notice any major noise when zooming in and out while recording video. I know this is the excuse Canon has used in the past as to why they never had this feature. It shoots nice clips for those quick moments. This will NOT replace a true DV cam, but hey, for a few minute clips here and there, you will simply not be dissapointed.""
"20110313","4.0","Good price nice cam.","I was debating getting a pocket HD cam and thought why not just get this, the price is about the same and maybe the video quality will be a little better.  Plus, portable point and shoot with fun modes built in. The video quality is comprable to the pocket HD cams, and it is smaller than the pocket HD cam I had before.  I am still surprised at the size.  It is smaller than my smartphone.I'm having trouble in lower light settings with all functions of the camera, but I'm still learning it.  The camera isn't as intuitive as I hoped, but as soon as I figured out where all the menus were I was more or less good to go and play around.Currently the amazon info says it has creative light 'Creative Light Effect Transform background bright spots to stars, hearts, music motes and more.' I was looking forward to this, but I haven't been able to find it, and it isn't listed as a shooting mode on the canon site.  That makes me a little bit sad.  One of the other things that isn't clear from the camera info is that you cannot shoot slow motion in HD (240fps is 320 and 120fps shoots at 640) and there is no audio.  Not the end of the world given all the other things the camera does, but again, something I was hoping to play with that I won't be able to.Overall the quality is what I would expect given the price.  I am still in awe of the tiny size and weight.  It really does fit in my pocket.  I'm happy with the quality of the HD video for web display (it doesn't look so great going through HDMI on our 42in HDTV).  And once I figured out how to access the different shooting modes etc, it became very easy to use.""
"20110312","2.0","Canon Elph 300 HS","I expected a lot better from a camera in the Canon Elph series than the 300 HS produced. The camera I received doesn't want to focus on the objects that I want it to focus on. I have tried both automatic and manual modes, and it still won't produce a consistant in focus photo. The couple of photos that I did manage to get in focus, were much to grainy. The camera is a severe disappointment for me, and is being return for a refund.The body of the camera has a rough feel texture. Another problem with this camera is that no where on the body is it designed for you to effectively hold the camera. The flash placement is such that it can easily be blocked or adversely effected by how the user holds the camera.""
"20110310","5.0","Awesome Pocket Camera","Got this camera from my Japanese friend as a birthday gift, which is IXY 410F.  I found out that camera name in USA is ELPH 300 HS.  After open the box and play couple days, the weight is super light as my old school Canon SD1000 and the indoor picture quality is not bad comparing with my current S95, so it catched my eyes right away after we received it.  Even it's SD1400 replacement from canon point of view, I have to say this tiny camera with S95 quality.ELPH 300 HS vs S95ELPH 300 HS wins on 1080P movie, weight (70% of S95), CMOS sensor, 24mm, 5x zoom, shooting speed (2 time faster than S95), cost (62.5% of S95)S95 is better on the sensor size (1/1.7' as G12), Aperture F/2.0, RAW.I would say...For sure S95 won on manual setting, but I used my Canon Rebel XS most of the time when looking for quality pictures, and S95 didn't provide more point-and-shoot advantages than ELPH 300 HS to me. CMOS sensor is more sensertive comparing with CCD, so I cannot tell huge difference between bigger size CCD and smaller size CMOS sensors even from those indoor low light pictures.  End out, I traded the manual settings to small size, light weight, and fast shooting speed.So, my S95 moved on eBay...... and IXY 410F (ELPH 300 HS) is in my wife's bag......  I have to wait for it to be available on Amazon to get another one for myself.""

"20120403","1.0","Good pictures, terrible durability","I bought this camera in June 2011.  The pictures were good, though not as great as I had hoped.  They were only somewhat better than those I had taken with a Sony Cybershot purchased in 2003.  The HD video, however, was excellent and quickly became a favorite feature.  Unfortunately, the camera refused to open when I turned it on in September.  I sent it back to Canon and they replaced it.  I paid shipping.  I had a new camera in a week.  The camera they sent me, however, was defective.  The shutter would not consistently open all the way or close completely.  I needed to send it back again.  They paid shipping this time, and replaced it once more.  Another week without a camera.  In January, I noticed a spot had developed on the lens that showed up on any photo I took with telephoto.  Very frustrating.  I didn't address it immediately with Canon, however, having already been frustrated with my experiences with the camera.  Then last week I took the camera to the park--I placed it in my front pants pocket as I've always done, and when I took it out, the top of the camera had split open and one of the tabs that held the camera together was sticking out.  I sent the camera back to Canon.  They considered this damage to the camera and refused to fix it without charging me $140.  Now, nine months into this camera, I'm left with virtually nothing--I'm not going to invest anymore money into the camera because of its durability issues.  My Sony lasted eight years--the main reason I wanted to upgrade was the advances in technology.  I didn't treat this camera any differently than I treated the Sony.  My recommendation is to stay away from this Canon Powershot Elph 300 HS--it's a durability nightmare.  Four major concerns in nine months, and now, no Canon support.""
"20120402","5.0","Great Camera","I've been using the camera for a while now and have not had any issues. It is easy to use and takes good pictures. I do recommend it. Excellent optics,small & thin... very compact.The only problem is I should have waited a couple of months to purchace it. It dropped from $180.00 to $130.00 in that time period.""
"20120401","1.0","Died within 1 year","I purchased this camera in May 2011 as a replacement for another Canon Powershot that had a lens failure (lens stuck out and could not retract). In March of 2012, our gently used PowerShot ELPH 300HS lens, while on vacation, also spontaneously had the lens failure 'Lens Error... Will shut down automatically.. Please restart camera' error. Ugh.All of the recommended tips to 'unstick' the guide pins on this lens failed so, I have another $250 down the drain. Never again. I researched this purchase extensively, and chose the 300HS so I could reuse the battery packs and charger from my previous PowerShot. The camera worked well prior to it's demise. However, after the second Canon PowerShot to die the same death with potentially dirt or fragile guide pins in the automatically retracting/extending lens...I have determined that this type of lens in general is a serious design flaw and should be avoided.With a camera at this price range, it's really not worth sending back for repairs, as it will be at least 1/2 the cost of the camera to repair.I would highly recommend people consider more ruggedized versions, or a 'sealed' lens that does not have fully automatic extension/retraction. This may be available in some of the higher-end waterproof digital cameras out there on the market that do not have the concentric lens barrels that can get small dirt or sand particles stuck in them causing this error. Another option I would consider is investing in slightly higher end fixed-lenses, or simply rely on better smart phones with built-in cameras if portability is a key factor.""

"20120330","5.0","slim yet powerful","Great little camera.A few things I liked:1) Black finish with unpolished texture to entire casing (gives it a rough, durable-feeling, unslippery grip to it) - kinda manly, too!2) Long battery life - I took it on a ski trip and it lasted me about three days of frequent shooting (HD video-shooting will definitely zap the battery a little faster)3) Cool picture-taking functions: e.g. function to stitch pictures together for a panoramic photo like city skylines, color-isolation like B&W photo of a woman with only red for the color of her dress, and too many more to mention but those are two I really had a chance to play with.4) Options for fine-tuning your photos and details: e.g. light-setting whether in dim-lit settings, bright sunny outdoors, cloudy day, or under fluorescent, etc.5) 1080P videos with really good stabilization.  I've tested the slo-mo function and that was really cool, too.6) Size: this camera was quite slim and fits in pocket nicely7) Price: Bought it for 149 from AMZNCONS:Well, there wasn't any, really.  I was so tempted to purchase the S90 mainly because I heard it takes closer to DSLR quality photos, but I'm satisfied with my Elph300 purchase mainly because of size and price factors.  Plus, the Elph300 received quite a lot of good reviews and has been in many hands that will vouch for it.If I had to list some CONS, I'd probably say1) It didn't include an HDMI cable - since camera takes full 1080p, it would have been great to actually see this quality displayed on a TV screen2) On my ski trip, the camera fogged up on me most of the time, but I don't think that would have been avoided with any camera due to the quick change in temperature causing humidity to fog up the insides of the camera.All in all, great purchase!  Can't go wrong at that price point.  Really good bang for the buck.  I'd highly recommend it.  Happy Shooting, everyone!""
"20120329","5.0","Who knew a p&s could be so spectacular?","I love this little camera. I was in the market for a point and shoot I could carry around in my purse for just taking photos, since I don't carry my high-end DSLR around. I'm a Canon fan-kid all the way, however I bought a Nikon p&s prior to this one. I returned it the next day and bought this one without a second thought. Canon always delivers the best, and this is the BEST point and shoot camera I've ever used, especially for the price. I'm very picky when it comes to quality, I have no complaints with this camera. It has fun effects to play around with, too. I don't think I'll ever regret this purchase, and you won't, either!""
"20120329","5.0","Best point and shoot for the price","I bought this camera because we were going to go on vacation and I wanted to have nice pictures. This camera did not disappoint, it is very small and takes wonderful pictures. I don't like to record much videos so I pretty much ignored that part when purchasing this camera. But once I got my hands on it and started recording things I was blown away by the quality. It has a wonderful image stabilization that will make your pictures and videos much less shaky. The video is also in 1080p so once you move the file over into your computer and watch it, it looks amazing. I recommend this camera to anyone just looking for a good point and shoot, but I would recommend you also buy at least a 16GB sd card.""
"20120326","5.0","A tiny, but powerful camera","This camera appears to have been discontinued by Canon. The small size of this camera belies the quality and many options available in this very small and light package. Think of it as the smaller version of the S-95 model, one I had for a while recently.The features of this camera are many, most of them  available through the menu, which is a little tedious, but thorough.The colors are very good, you can easily get  a good quality 8x10, as long as it's well-lit and well exposed.I have not used the video feature in the camera yet, but it has a slow-motion option, something not usually seen in cameras in this price range.Hurry and get this model, before it's all gone from the store shelves. If that happens, get a used model in good condition.""
"20120324","5.0","The elph canon PowerShot 300","The is definitely a fun an easy to go anywhere camera. How small it is this camera amazes me for the great pictures it takes. Very happy getting this camera and would recommend to buying it because this camera does hold up to its repetitation.""
"20120323","5.0","Love this product!","Absolutely love this camera. The pictures it takes are just amazing and the HD recording is unreal for the size of this camera. Would highly recommend this camera to anyone that needs a nice small camera to take amazing photos.""
"20120322","3.0","Auto focus? No focus!","Pros:  This camera performs better than my Panasonic ZS5 in low light indoor conditions, but that's where it's benefits end.Cons:  Lots of blurry and not sharp pictures in normal light situations  - where you would think camera should perform 'great'.  Also, it's auto focus is the worst: you might want to take a picture of a walking person or moving object, but it will focus on a fence, you will want to take a picture of a building - but it will focus on a branch of a nearby tree. You can tweak the settings, force infinity mode - but nonetheless, after my smart Panny the performance is extremely frustrating (keep in mind that they are selling for almost the same price nowadays).  Macro shots - look decent, but the ones coming out of Panny still have more details and are more sharp.I also feel that there is a lack of scene settings: they have added some 'extra' modes - like miniature effect and fisheye - but i really think it's pure BS - wish they have concentrated on features that are truly usable.After playing with this cam and comparing pictures to my old one, i'm returning this one - dont want to wait until it becomes totally unusable.""
"20120321","3.0","Kind of regret getting this camera.","I do like this particular camera for its asthetics and HD video capability. I've owned it for a few months now and it REALLY doesn't do a good job for what I need it for. I take mostly close up photos against a white background and some minor background lighting. This camera cannot handle macro mode very well. More times than not, the photo ends up blurry. It also likes to not use the flash in situations that probably call for it. There is no way to force the flash that I can see. Its too bad when you have just enough light for the camera to think it doesn't need a flash, but you feel it needs one. Ultimately the photo suffers. And speaking of the photos. There is something very wonky with the color profile. When I adjust the tone, brightness and contrast of the photo in photoshop it always pushes the photo into a darker range and the colors are always a little bit off of what they should be. Its not a horrible camera. I'm sure it works much better doing outdoor photos in daylight, or photos from several feet away. Its just horrible for close up photos with indoor lighting (even in macro mode). HD video and slow motion are really nice though!""
"20120320","4.0","Good camera","I've been using the camera for a while now and have not had any issues. It is easy to use and takes good pictures. I do recommend it.""
"20120317","4.0","good camera","Excellent optics,small & thin... very compact.The only problem is I should have waited a couple of months to purchace it. It dropped from $180.00 to $130.00 in that time period.""
"20120316","5.0","love this camera","I upgraded to this camera from an older Canon and It works really well. It works so well that I bought one for my girlfriend too after I tried mine.""
"20120316","5.0","Great camera for the price!","Great camera for the price!  Lightweight, compact, portable, and everything I want in a small, simple camera to take camping, concerts, and for just about whatever.  I highly recommend it!""
"20120316","1.0","cannot handle bright light","I am very disappointed in this camera.  I bought it because I have had good experiences with Canon cameras in the past, and because it is small and lightweight, and therefore, seemed like an ideal travel companion.  But it CANNOT handle bright light.  I tried every possible setting, and still, bright light shows up as white, and the rest of the picture is blurred or colors are all distorted.  One good thing is the video setting - it shoots nice videos.  But again, the bright light issue 'overshadows' all the pros for me.""
"20120315","4.0","love canon","I love canon products and refuse to buy anything different because they are so durable. however, the quality of the picture is not QUITE what I had hoped... some pictures turn out blurry. this also may be user error of course :)""
"20120315","4.0","Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Full 1080p HD Video (Silver)","This was a gift for my grand daughter. It is a great camera, it was easy for her to master in a few hour. My order was process promptly. Thanks for your attention to details.""
"20120315","4.0","Canon Power Shot","Camera is compact and light.  Very easy to learn to use and takes great pictures.  Great quality for the dollars spent.""
"20120314","4.0","good for novice","If you need a camera to augment a more prosumer-type camera, this camera is small enough to fill the bill. The only cons, IMHO, were lack of TTL and flash placement (I personally prefer pop-up flash - finger can block flash accidentally).""
"20120314","5.0","Best camera for the money","I was looking to replace my little point and shoot camera that I have had for years and years. I trust Canon the most for point and shoots and based on the reviews of this one decided to pick the Elph 300. I also use a Nikon D60 and wanted something that had excellent picture quality so I would not have to lug around my Nikon for quick shots. This camera is definitely it. It is so small! I'd say it is just a little bigger than a credit card. It is very light weight. The body has a sand paper like texture to it which makes it easier to grip. The view screen is very nice. I like the different ways you can customize your settings. It's pretty standard. It has tons of effects, if you like that sort of thing, like fisheye, toy cam, color swap, color accent, b&w, etc. As well as, various modes of shooting in different conditions. To access the effects takes a second. It takes great pictures! Really really great pictures! I have been playing around with it since I got it and I am pleasantly surprised every time. So far, I have yet to find a condition where the camera didn't take a great photo. I highly recommend this camera!""
"20120313","5.0","Amazing point and shoot","You won't be disappointed in this one! For a point and shoot camera, I found that the Canon PS Elph 300 lived up expectation and more. I just used it last week for my brother's girlfriend st. patty's day run in kansas city and the shots I got were phenomenal. Even the video I captured was awesome. I can't complain really. Setting the software up with my macbook was a breeze. Go ahead and pick one up. You wont regret it.""
"20120313","3.0","OK but not Great","Unit seemed too small in my hands, you have to be careful or you cover the flash.  Takes shots way too slowly I felt like I would miss too many pics.""
"20120313","5.0","Compact, Clear pictures, nice video, good manual functions","I bought this camera so i could have something to carry in my pocket on hikes and skateboarding and just whenever.  The quality of the picture is really good for a compact camera and the HD video is very clear.  The camera has a good amount of manual functions which I like to play with but also the auto does a good job of creating a quality image.  I also like the grippy texture on the outside, it makes it easier to handle.  I haven't owned it for long so I can't say anything about the durability but definitely a nice camera. I initially had issues with the video not saving right, so make sure you have an SD card class 6 or higher for the HD video and that you format the card (settings then format on camera).  The only downfall is the very wild angle lens.  I like the wide andle for some shots but sometimes it makes close up images a little weird (people have big heads and little feet)  This is not usually a problem and can provide cool effects and widen the shot which is good for indoors.  However, if your shooting outdoors i feel it limits some shots, for the most part you can solve this problem by zooming in a little.overall great camera for the value""
