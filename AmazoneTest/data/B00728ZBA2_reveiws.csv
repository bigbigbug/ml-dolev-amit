"20120611","5.0","ZS20, a nice step up!","I have had this new camera for a bout a week now, and I like it. I had another digital camera, admittedly, a sub 100.00 model and this really makes a difference. I like having some adjust ability on the camera, tho' it's easy to just point and shoot, too. Great focus, which was an issue on my previous model (GE A830--it was a disappointing purchase). Super nice video, 1080p, looks great on my 35' tv. Night shots, no problem, AMAZING 20X optical zoom, different color maps to make the scenery pop out, or mute it down,  HDR effect, nice build. It was a little bit more than I wanted to spend, but I'm glad i did. Use it as a point and shoot, or get a little bit more creative, you will be happy w/ the result. get a big SD card, cuz it has next to no internal memory (1 14 meg pic) The files are big, even when you use a 10 meg pic size (about 4.5 megs per pic).Overall, I would recommend if you would like an above average point and shoot super zoom cam w/ movie capability.""
"20120610","5.0","Panasonic camera is awesome.","We just returned from a trip to Germany and Switzerland.  The pics all came out great and even took a video while driving through the Alps and everybody loved the quality of the video.  It made them feel like they were there with us.""
"20120609","4.0","Terrific little camera","The zs20 has lived up to my expectations in nearly every way.  The only complaint I have, as have others for years, is Panasonic's tendency to create yellow-brown interior images.  I'd love to believe an update would fix this, but I doubt it either can or will be done.  Other than that the camera is fun and the images excellent.  And it's amazingly small size, compared to the Sony, make it easy to transport.  Very happy with my purchase!""

"20120606","3.0","Great Pictures but a little soft","I own a ZS6 and loved it, but because the ZS20 has 20x zoom and it can take still images while taking videos, I thought it was time to upgrade and I bought one.  I tried out my new ZS20 at my grand niece's christening and took pictures of my family and wow, all the pictures came out beautiful and the videos were great, better than my ZS6.  The thing I notice though is that pictures came out a little soft, even in bright sunlight and with flash.  This might be OK for other people but not for me; I like my pictures sharp.  I looked at old pictures that I took with my ZS6 and the pictures are sharper.  The other thing that I noticed with the ZS20 is that it doesn't have the Picture Adjustment mode where you can adjust the contrast, sharpness, saturation and noise reduction.  I use the sharpness adjustment a lot with my ZS6 when taking pictures of flowers and scenery.  The sharpness adjustment on the ZS20 would have solved this issue and I wouldn't have to return the camera.  I got it for a very good price too, $269.  It's a shame.I wish Panasonic would put back the Picture Adjustment mode to next year's model and increase the megapixels on the still images from video to at least 5 or 7 megs.  The 3.5 megapixel images taken from the video are too soft also.  I'm gonna hold on to my ZS6 for now.""

It was not fully clear if there were instruction on all languages on only in a few ones (English and Spanish only). Furthermore, it was not clear if the product could be made suitable for international use in other video standards, as generally happnes for most Japanese cameras.""
"20120603","5.0","Great camera for the price","This was the first camera of this type that I have purchased. It offers more features than the slr like camera I purchased 5 years ago that was $200 more.The panoramic feature came in very handy. The custom scene features work very well for novice photographers like me.Video was absolutely amazing. I thought I was watching hd tv.""
"20120602","5.0","This review is for the Lumix ZS19 which is the same as this camera but without GPS","I want to preface that I am not a professional or very dedicated photographer. My review is for people like me: love photography, use mostly scene settings, some manual tinkering (aperture and shutter speed priority) and love to take scenery and wildlife pictures. I am in the market for a smaller camera to take to my hikes/travel etc. to replace my Lumix FZ28 which was stolen on my recent trip to Costa Rica. I already have a Nikon D5100 which I love and takes great pics, but it is just to heavy and bulky to take along. I purchased both a Canon SX260HS and a Lumix ZS19 to try out because both their specifications seem comparable and I trust both brands. I took pics side by side with these two cameras, and here are my observations:1. color: panasonic colors were generally cooler with more green/blue vs. the canon's warmer colors (yellowish tones) for the same scenes and lighting2. the HDR features of the Lumix are amazing for high contrast/bright background.3. the zoomed pictures for the Lumix were clearer (less blurry) than the Canon's (I took pictures of a power tower and some distant hills in the late afternoon light)4. the most important consideration for me was the ability to focus. I took pictures of flowers and foliage and the Lumix clearly outshone with the feature of the touch screen (I could tell it to focus on a particular petal or detail just by touching the image on the screen) whereas I ended up with a lot of out of focus pictures with the Canon.Note that I did not try the GPS feature of the Canon since it is not that important to me.In conclusion, even the expert reviews talk about a better image quality of the Canon SX260, I decided that for my purposes, I prefer the images that the Lumix ZS19.I am going to return both cameras today and order the Lumix ZS20 instead (because of the promotion, the price of the ZS20 is the same as what I paid for the ZS19, so the GPS feature is for free!!!)""
"20120601","5.0","Buy it!","I searched for a while to find a great camera.  I am not technically saavy enough (nor patient enough) to operate technically impossible and heavy camera equipment.  I just wanted a nice, compact model that would take breathtaking pictures (Sorry Ashton, I passed up the cool pics camera).  I have done research and know Leica products to be very reliable and I trust this name. This one has amazing zoom, amazing special effects, takes great pictures, and even has a waterproof case if you want.  I just got it weeks ago and have not completely read the manual, but worth the money.  I am so pleased with the quality of the pictures thatI had to write this review.""
"20120531","3.0","Better for travel than indoor/people...","I wanted to like this camera so much, but will be returning it.My main goal was to find a non-DSLR that would work indoors to take photos of people without a flash -- kids, birthday parties, etc. Seems simple, but as I'm learning is a difficult thing to find. In the end, the ZS20 just didn't deliver there. The photos were never sharp indoors, even when people were perfectly still.The reason I'm so disappointed is that there is so much else to love. The 20X zoom is incredible...I got cool close-ups I never could have otherwise. The camera is FAST - it's ready for the next photo immediately. On the touch screen you can touch the spot where you want to focus and even take the shot just from pressing it. Other features like face recognition, panorama modes and macro modes worked were cool.The IA (Intelligent Auto) mode worked very well for me. Most of the time the camera quickly detected the best settings for the shot. An example was my kids...I was taking photos of them when they put a bunch of flowers close to the lens -- it immediately went into macro mode and took a great photo of the flowers.Indoors, the color quality of still shots was great, but it was the PEOPLE that never came out crisply.Outdoors, photos were amazing, but a lot of cameras are.I borrowed a Nikon Coolpix P300 to try out...and it just took those critical indoor shots better. I compared them side-by-side. If I was traveling and outdoors more I would keep the Lumix -- there are SO many other features on the Lumix ZS20 that I love, but if I'm always going to be disappointed by my indoor photos of people, I just can't keep it.""
"20120531","5.0","My ZS20 is a keeper","First pass test of stills & video, including zooming to 20X meets my expectation...and then some.  After doing a serious review of camera data for several models, I rated this Panasonic unit second to the Canon S100, but the S100 has only a 5X zoom....I needed more.  After a data review determined the top 3, I did a hands on feel, operationonal fuction, and sample photo tests.  The ZS20 won based on a more solid feel, and faster focus.  The other two had a light weight plastic feel.  Ease of operation and picture quality were all close to equal.""
"20120531","5.0","Awesome camera. My second Lumix. They keep getting better","The camera works flawlessly. Pictures are shap even in low light with out using flash.  The GPS feature is super for geo tagging photos while traveling.  The long zoom lens (why I purchased this model) is great!!""
"20120527","2.0","I wanted so badly to love this camera","Where do I start?  The features on this camera are amazing.  The burst shooting modes, the 1080p video, the 20x zoom, the manual controls, scene modes, handling, and menus, are stunning and as close to perfect as you can get - at any price point for a camera that easily fits into a pocket.  This camera seemed a bargain for the features.So why two stars?  Poor picture quality.  I have a camera with $400-camera features and $125-camera photo quality.  Maybe I got a bad copy, but I'm reading other reviews saying the same thing so either production isn't consistent or perhaps some people are less discerning regarding photo quality.  Several professional reviews (CNET, digitalcamerainfo, and others) have stated that though this model is vastly improved over the previous top of the line Panasonic compact offering it is still sub-par.  The guy from CNET said that 'Depending on what your plans are for its photos, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS20's shots are either very good to excellent or unusable'.  I have to agree.  If you never plan on going bigger than 4x6 or maybe 5x7s you'll probably be fine.  Comparing the photos from my five-year old Kodak Easyshare C875 showed only marginal improvements in some pictures, but most were about the same - some were worse and the colors seemed washed out and duller than reality.  The softness and noise of the photos is noticeable upon close inspection even at regular viewing sizes.  Oh, and yes, I did the half-press to allow the camera to focus - so that's not the problem.Using the 'Intelligent Auto' feature was frustrating at best.  Images rarely turned out nicely and I constantly found myself going into the manual modes to try to make the camera take a better picture.  As a father my primary purpose for this camera was taking photos of the kids.  When they're doing something cute or funny I don't want to mess around with settings.  I want to turn the camera on and capture the moment.  With this camera many moments were lost.  Also, I had many images blurred from movement while using the intelligent auto mode and I would think a truly intelligent auto should adjust shutter speed for detected motion.  The camera seemed to do okay when shooting subjects without a lot of detail and that were not moving.Then there are the burst pictures.  The concept is great, but usually people using this feature would be using them in action-type shots.  Unfortunately the intelligent auto feature doesn't know how to handle this and the pictures all turned out blurry.  All - even with the 'Motion Deblur' on and the 'iHDR' turned off.  Trust me I monkeyed and monkeyed with this thing to figure out what I was doing wrong.  In the end I had to conclude it was the camera.  The other problem with the burst mode is that, while the 2AF and 5AF photos were okay (though still sub-par), the 10, 40, and 60 fps shots looked like something taken with a prehistoric first-generation cell-phone camera.  Horrible and unusable for anything other than having.  Even the manual mode shots were mostly unusable at 10, 40, and 60fps.Other quibbles are the FLIMSY battery/SD door and the weird crunching sound from the lens when adjusting zoom - though they're definitely not deal-breakers.Some Amazon reviewers have loved this camera.  One said they dropped it from a five-story building and it survived.  Impressive.  Others have said they're seeing near DSLR quality photos.  Good for them.  Me?  I took well over a thousand pictures with this camera and spent hours adjusting settings to no avail.  I'm sending mine back and looking for a different model.  Though I'd like to give a different ZS20 another chance in hopes of achieving the type of success some reviewers here at Amazon are claiming, I really think these sorts of quality control issues are unacceptable in 2012.  I'm not even sure mine is an isolated incident considering the comments from professional camera reviewing websites.  A camera can have all the greatest features but if it can't deliver beautiful photos what good are the features?  I was mostly happy with the photos from my five-year old 8MP Kodak C875 so I don't think I'm being too picky.  I expected better quality than my C875 - what I got I'm not sure is even up to the level of the C875.By the way, I'm seeing on camera forums that Panasonic is rushing out a firmware update to improve the ZS20 photo-quality.  It's not out yet, and it may just be a rumor, but keep on the lookout.  While it's too late for me as mine is going back, maybe it will be useful for you.""
"20120527","5.0","Love my new Lumix","I have had Panasonic Lumix cameras before and liked them very much. But this one I love. It is finally fast enough to stop most of my action shots, which was very important to me with grandkids who needed to be photographed frequently. Sometimes with animals. It steadies the focus well when zoomed out. And it zooms out A LOT! I got it before my trip to Russia and it performed like a trooper. I did buy two extra batteries and a charger which I couldn't have done without. And a 16GB class 10 memory card. Filled it. Good thing I took an 8 GB class 6 backup card. People make fun of all the pictures I take. Multiples of almost every shot, if possible, because so many were usually blurry. So when I got home with almost 3500 pictures from a twelve day trip I thought it would be like usual and I would be deleting at least half because they were not worth printing. But I've only deleted about 80-100 as unsalvageable. So now I have lots of decisions to make as which ones are keepers. Best of all, it is still small enough to fit into my purse as a permanent accessory.""
"20120527","5.0","A Whole Lot of a Little Camera!","I have had this camera for a short while now and it is time for a review.  I have several Panasonic Cameras to include the FZ100 and FZ150, the FZ35 and the ZS3.  I also have the Sony HX9V and will make a comparison with it.  The ZS20 is an outstanding camera that takes sharp detailed pictures with low noise.  I have compared it with the Sony HX9V in low light and the ZS20 is just as good in low light with pictures.  I did notice the Sony does better in low light with video.I would like to say something negative about the ZS20, and the only thing negative I can say about it is I wish the f/stop would go lower than f/3.3.  It does go from f/3.3 to f/8, which is better than the Sony which goes to f/5.9. It also does not come with a battery charger, but they are cheap on Amazon.  The batteries are cheap as well on Amazon.  The battery life does seem to be fairly long between charges.The Panasonic works great in Manual, giving full control of the f/stop, the shutter speed, and the ISO.  The Sony Manual controls basically suck.  The only mode you can control is the shutter speed in Manual.The menus are Panasonic and if you have any other Panasonic camera the menus will feel right at home. The camera has 4 Priority Modes of Aperture, Shutter, Program, and Manual.The Shutter Speed is controllable from 1/2000 to 8 seconds in Shutter Priority and 1/2000 second to 15 seconds in Manual.Burst Mode:  The camera has 6 burst modes.  2 fps (frames per second) Auto focus,  5 fps Auto focus, 10 fps, 40 fps, 60 fps, and Flash Burst.  In the 2 and 5 AF modes the camera will focus in between each shot.  In the 10 fps mode, the camera will take 10 shots in a row.  wait one second and it will take 8 more.  Wait one second and it will take 8 more.  In the 5 fps AF mode it will take 100 pictures straight without stopping!  I assume it will do it in the 2 fps mode as well but did not check that. In Flash Burst it will take 5 flash burst pictures in quick succession.The ZS20 will zoom to 20X in the 14mp picture mode.  If the camera is set to 10mp picture size and I-Zoom is turned on it will zoom to 47.3X.  This is with digital zoom turned off.I have found that picture quality is extremely good and detailed.Macro works great and there are two modes.  The mode with AF beside the Macro Symbol is good for taking a shot of something at a distance of 3 to 4 feet.  Zoom in as much as needed and the camera will focus on the object.  If it does not focus you are too close.  The mode with the Macro symbol and the magnifying glass is for close up macro work.  The camera will only zoom to 3X, but will focus up close and personal.The camera has GPS Tagging.  I tried it and it works.  My photo software picked up the tracking and showed the place taken on a map.  I tried turning on GPS tracking and left it on for 5 hours while I turned the camera off and it showed no signs of battery usage.  I would recommend if you are going to use it to turn it on way before taking a picture as it takes a while to find itself the first time.  I was able to shorten the time it takes to find itself by hooking the camera to my computer the first time to tell the camera where I was located.The LCD can be seen in bright daylight.  I set the LCD to auto adjust by going to Menu Set in any program mode, such as Aperture, Setup Menu, page 3, LCD Mode and set it for A (auto power LCD).  Press Menu Set again and it will show the A with a square and a star on it in the picture mode. To get out of the Menu Modes press the return button on the bottom of the camera below the Menu Set rocker on the right lower side of the camera.A still photo 3.5mp picture can be taken while taking video by pressing the shutter button.  A still photo can also be captured in playback video by playing the video back on the camera and pressing the button on top of Menu Set to pause the video and then press Menu Set and it will ask you if you want to 'Save this image?'.  To save it highlight YES and push Menu Set.  In AVCHD progressing HD video the camera will record for 30 minutes.  In the GPH mode of AVCHD video GPS information is also added to the video.  I don't know how the GPS information is then pulled out of the video.  In the MP4 mode of video my camera goes 27 minutes.The SCN modes on the main dial work outstanding.  I really like the HDR mode that takes three pictures at different exposure levels and combines them into one picture.  The Night Portrait works great for taking a portrait with a building or night scene behind the subject.  Night Scenery works great and holds the shutter open for up to 8 seconds.  Handheld Night Shot is outstanding with no tripod and has saved me many times at night with no tripod.  The camera takes several pictures and combines them into one shot.  I also like it if you are in the SCN mode and turn the camera off.  When the camera is turned back on, press Menu Set and SCN mode is highlighted.  No reason to turn the main dial off of SCN and then back on SCN like you have to do on my FZ150.  The best mode in SCN is Panorama.  Just set the camera to Panorama, press and hold the shutter button and swing the camera for a Panoramic Shot.  You will have to play with that mode to get the hang of it.  At first I kept going too slow and it did not take the full Panorama.  The speed of panning has to be fairly brisk.  It makes one wonder how in the heck the camera can capture a shot panning that fast but it does.I especially like Zoom Resume. The camera remembers how it was zoomed on your last shots before turning the camera off and when the camera is turned back on it zooms back to the same setting.  It has saved me many times in getting a quick shot off and not having to zoom the camera again.  To set Zoom Resume, go to any priority mode, such as A, and press Menu Set.  Go to the Setup Menu, page 4, Zoom Resume on top and press the Menu Set button and turn it on.  Another really nice thing is to turn on the grid.  The grid will help you to take a picture in the Rule of Thirds and throws a grid on the screen to help you take a properly aligned shot.  Put any of the intersecting lines on the grid on your subject and instantly your pictures will be better and more enjoyable to view.  To turn it on, go to any of the priority modes, such as A, and go to the Setup Menu, page 3, second one down to Guide Line and turn it on.  The Histogram is also nice to see what the picture will look like, exposure wise, by looking at the Histogram on the LCD before you take the shot.  To turn it on, go to the Setup Menu on page 3, and select the third one down, Histogram and turn it on.The camera will Auto Bracket at 0, -1, and +1 maximum.  You can Auto Bracket at less with 1/3 exposure stop increments.  To turn Auto Bracket on press the button above Menu Set two times in the shooting mode.  Move the brackets by pressing the button on the right of Menu Set.  You can adjust exposure for all pictures by pressing the button above Menu Set one time.Manual Mode.  The shutter is adjustable from 1/2000 to 15 seconds.  The f/stop is adjustable from f/3.3 to f/8.  I really like how it works.  After selecting Manual, push the button above the Menu Set toggle called Exposure/Map.  Then pushing the button above and below Menu Set adjusts the shutter speed and the button on the left and right of Menu Set adjusts the f/stop.  To bring up the metering dial just half press the shutter button.That concludes my review at this time.  I am really enjoying this little camera and it takes some really great pictures.  I am amazed that they were able to cram so many features into such a little camera.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I am.""
"20120527","5.0","Great camera","This camera has lots of features and fits in my cargo pants pocket without pulling them down. The automatic mode is very impressive, takes great pictures without having to click several buttons and miss a good picture. I see some complaints about noise on low light pictures but this camera is far better than the old Lumix(s); the noise is barely noticable but I'm not a pro. I make picture books with pages up to 13' x 11' and the photos look great, even the ones in low light.I bought this camera mostly for the 20 (up to 40) zoom; it is amazing and with no camera shake; nothing like a close-up of a grizzly from 200 feet away; and the macro feature is excellent; near perfect panoramic stitching and the movies are very impressive. I also have an older Lumix and it uses the same battery, lucky me.Cons: the manual (and on-line one) is so-so. If you really want to know this camera you have to spend some time playing and testing all the features. The touch screen has limited functions and works OK, but it seems faster to just use the buttons. Also, when the lens extends it makes a little grinding noise which I guess is OK as I haven't had a problem.Overall, this is a great camera and if you are like me, just use the basic modes and have fun.""

Highly recommend for those tired of lugging their SLRaround.  Fits in my cargo shorts pocket - comfortably.""
"20120522","5.0","Astounding machine!","So let's get the low-light thing out of the way... I owned two of the early models of Lumix and was a big fan.  Big enough such that I only gave other brands a cursory glance when looking for another new camera.  The low-light problem has, however, been a problem with these models for a long time. It can be somewhat mitigated with the flash and exposure time, but low-light pictures can still be frustrating.While I was already a fan of the camera despite this one issue, this weekend solidified me as a customer for life.  Less than 24 hours after receiving the camera from Amazon I was on a rooftop bar in Asheville, NC taking wonderful photos of the mountains in the distance.  When the people in front of us moved from their table next to the edge, we moved over to get a better view.  A decision which next lead to me knocking the camera off the side of the balcony.  Five stories up.  I watched the camera twist and fall and finally, with a *thunk* land LCD side down on the roof of the building next door and then slide 30 feet and smash against the side of that roof.  I was sure the camera was gone, but I went down to check on it anyway.  To my complete surprise and delight the only noticeable damage was some very minor scratching on the LCD screen itself.  Even more shocking was that the camera still turned on.  And took pictures.  And video.  And the flash works.  Amazing.The form-factor on this camera is wonderful.  The zoom is fantastic.  The LCD screen is bright and clear, and I'm a fan of the quick-switch b/t taking pictures and viewing. (definitely a complaint I had with my first model)  But, really, if you're looking for a camera that just won't quit, this is it.  Not that I suggest you try drinking on a rooftop and kicking your camera over the side... but if you do, I won't be surprised to hear that it survived.""
"20120521","2.0","Not nearly as good as I expected","Unlike most of the other reviews, my experience with this camera was not good and I returned it.  I researched quite a bit and thought I was buying a good point and shoot.  I really wanted something that would allow me to leave my DSLR at home except for special occasions.  Maybe I got a bum lens or CCD, but the pictures just were not that good.  There was no crispness, and the colors seemed washed out and even unnatural.  I tried many different settings (fully manual, intelligent auto, shutter priority, aperture priority, color settings). None of them resulted in what I would describe as a good quality picture.  I'm comparing it with a 5 year old entry level 10 MP DSLR (Pentax k200), and an even older 6 MP point and shoot (Nikon Coolpix P4).  In my opinion both of those older cameras produced better quality pictures than this state-of-the-art megazoom camera.  Maybe it's unfair to expect this to perform as well as even a relatively cheap DSLR (although other reviewers here have done so), but it should have been way better than my old Coolpix P4.I have to say the zoom range on this camera was incredible.  I also liked the flexibility from full-auto to fully manual.  This would have been perfect for an SLR guy like me.  The touch screen on the back is borderline useless, but that's easy to ignore. Picture quality on the other hand?  I can't ignore that at this price point.  I'm back to the drawing board, and again researching other point-and-shoot cameras.""

"20120520","5.0","Panasonic Lumix zs20 vs. Canon SX260HS vs. Panasonic ZS15 vs DSLR","Panasonic ZS20 is an excellent camera. Autofocus is much better than Cannon SX260. Both have 20x optical zoom. Canon sx260 has issues with hissing noise in the background of all the video I took. I am impressed with the panoramic picture that Panasonic takes. Canon's way of doing panoramic is so slow and difficult because you need to use computer to 'stitch' them together. From the review I read, Panasonic ZS15 (lower price)is supposed to have better sensor, therefore better image quality, but comes with 16X optical zoom and no GPS.I would have tried Panasonic ZS15 had I read professional reviews earlier. Overall, I am very happy with this camera. It is supposedly smallest superzoom camera on the planet in 2012.  I was in the market for DSLR. But how often I am going to carry that camera bag around? This Panasonic can easily fit in the pocket, be carried around easily. I decided that a picture captured with my iphone or Panasonic ZS20 is much better than the picture I would have missed totally by taking the time to get DSLR out of the camera bag.""
"20120520","5.0","Great Camera","I bought this camera as an upgrade to my existing 5 year old compact digital. I specifically bought it to take on a Mediterranean cruise. While others were lugging around their digital SLR behemoths, the ZS20 comfortably fit it my pants pocket. I researched all type of cameras and once I settled on a compact digital, I decided to buy the newest, most feature laden compact digital I could find. I was not dissapointed in my selection of the ZS20. The picture quality is excellent and it is loaded with features. From one menu, you can pick settings for panorama, sunset, portrait, landscape, food shots and about a dozen more. However, left in its fully automatic mode, the picture quality is excellent. For the more advanced user, you can set aperture, shutter speed and a few other manual modes. It also has some neat picture modes - black & white, Sepia, one that gives you pictures a 1960's look, and one that makes your pic look like you are photographing toys. Filming video (1080 HD) is as easy as pressing one button. The 20X optical zoom is fantastic. You can double that with the digital zoom, but the 20X is unbelievable. You can shoot burst up to 10fps. There is a high speed video function that slows down fast action video (cool!).I was very impressed with the ease of learning so many of the features of this camera. It is very easy to use. This is a great camera if you are looking for a feature laden compact digital.""

"20120514","4.0","Very good traveling camera","So the Lumix ZS20 - currently the latest from Panasonic in this category of point and shoot, has a lot of pluses:* It's very small - easily fits in a shirt pocket.* It's fast - set on burst for 5 or 10 rapid photos in a fraction of a second.* Amazing range: from 25mm wide angle to a lens magnification of 20x and a digitally extended magnification of 40x. Photograph a rocky outcropping across a canyon with very good detail.* Color rendition is very good.* Shoot stills or video (HD) at will: not necessary to change modes for video.* Telephoto is available during video shoot.You can read about other features like GPS and photo effects at any of the better camera review sites: dpreview, cameralabs, etc..The main downside is image quality which can show digital artifacts, especially at telephoto. If you're used to SLR quality, then understand there is a trade off for the Panasonic's convenience and reasonable cost. That said, it truly is a good travel camera. And non-techies will find it easy enough to use too!""
"20120513","5.0","Good things come in small packages","Friends who lug around heavy DSLR kits (like I used to do) turn green with envy at what this little shirtpocket wonder can accomplish.  The ZS20's zoom range from 24mm wide open to 480mm fully optical at 14 mpx has to be seen to be believed.  You can start with a broad view of a landscape and then zoom in to capture a single bird on a tree so far away that you don't even see the bird in the landscape view.  The images are sharp, well saturated, with none of the blurriness and occasional purple fringing that troubled the ZS10.  The updated lenses also seem have shortened the depth of field so that I can now get the bird in sharp focus but the background some distance away is soft and blurry.  They've also vastly improved the digital zoom so that you can now take useful pictures at the equivalent of a 1013mm zoom range, and even longer at reduced MPx.  Those digitally assisted pix may not win photo contests but they'll tell you whether that distant shorebird was an avocet or a killdeer. Carrying this camera is like having a telescope in your pocket.  But the amazing zoom is only the beginning. Equally useful are the burst modes. Lots of subjects -- from talking heads to grandkids to puppies to birds to flowers in the wind -- are in constant motion, and if you take just one shot, you're playing roulette.  The grandkid jumping over a log -- you really wanted him in midair, not on the landing.  In burst mode, you'll get two, or five, or 10 or even more shots during the leap, and back home on your computer you can pick the one you like best and discard the rest.  I now routinely take dozens or even hundreds of images of moving objects, and back at home at the computer I pick out the one or two keepers, and discard the rest.  The camera also has an intelligent burst mode that takes just one shot of a static object but automatically takes a burst if the object is moving.  This camera is smart!  Although it has manual adjustments for aperture and shutter speed, I hardly ever need them.  The IA (Intelligent Auto) setting handles ISO, white balance, aperture, shutter speed, and everything else instantly and with reliably excellent results in a wide range of conditions.  The ZS20 also automatically performs some operations that previously took a fair amount of effort in Photoshop, with plugins.  I was very skeptical of the hand-held night shot scene mode until I happened to be out in the evening of 'supermoon' without a tripod.  The orange moon had partly cleared the hills when I clicked the shutter.  The camera took a burst of exposures and then internally sifted and merged them, and in a second or two gave me as clear and sharp an image as if I had used a tripod.  It made a believer of me.  Equally good is the HDR setting for high-contrast and backlit subjects.  The camera takes a burst of exposures, bracketing the aperture, and then automatically combines them to produce a single image with a well-lit foreground.  It used to take a lot of work and luck in Photoshop to achieve this.  Totally amazing is the in-camera panorama scene mode.  Without a tripod, you stand in a spot, hold down the shutter and make a complete circle in about 8 seconds (the camera shows you a progress bar).  A few seconds later you've got, in the camera ready for downloading, a perfectly merged super-wide panorama image with no, or only very faintly perceptible, visual seams.  No further processing necessary.  There are a number of other scene modes and creative preset modes, and you can save custom settings for quick access.  The video on the ZS10 was already very good, and the 20 has only improved on it, performing in full 1080p HD, with better placement for the stereo microphones.I also like the fact that the same batteries used on the previous models work in this one.  I prefer to remove the battery and charge it in a wall charger (supplied with the older models), and I can still do that, but the 20 comes with a cable that lets the battery be charged in the camera from a wall plug or a USB port.The one annoyance with this little gem is the touch-screen controls on the digital display.  These controls let you set the focus and the zoom, and click the shutter, by touching the screen.  I can't imagine any situation where this would be useful. I unwittingly activated these controls by touching the screen and as I handled the camera I unknowingly took dozens of shots of my hand, the inside of my pocket, the ground, the side of my pants, and like that.  You can't turn this obnoxious 'feature' off!  I've learned not to touch the screen when handling the camera, so it isn't a problem any more, but it still diminishes my esteem for the otherwise admirable engineering job that Panasonic did on this camera.This camera -- actually, already its predecessor -- convinced me to dump the 50-lb DSLR outfit I had been lugging around for several years.  I don't need it.  For me, the ZS series has disrupted the DSLR market much in the same way that DSLRs disrupted the film SLR market.  Who needs all that heavy clunky expensive gear?  I can do 95% of what I did with the DSLR, and a great many things I couldn't, with this little gem that fits in my shirtpocket.""
"20120510","5.0","This Lumix ZS20 is one amazing little point and shoot camera","Wow, I am so impressed with this new Lumix ZS20 point and shoot camera. It is amazing. I previously own a Lumix ZS7 and loved it. But I upgraded to this new Lumix ZS20 because I had a dust spec stuck in the lens of my old ZS7 model and could not get rid of it.  The zoom on this new ZS20 is awesome. This camera takes great clear pictures during the day and at night. I was worried at first after reading online reviews of it not being able to take bright pictures at night. But that is not true. I took a chance and bought it anyway and couldn't be happier. All of the pictures are clear and beautiful. The videos turned out great too. I highly recommend this camera to everyone. You will love it too.""

"20120508","1.0","Camera may be nice (?) but customer support makes it a bad idea to purchase","Rec'd ZS20  today. Overjoyed! Had spent a LOT of time considering what pocket camera would be best to complement my SLR-and-too-many-lenses-etc kit.  Used it for 10 minutes.  Handed it to wife.  She says zoom doesn't work. She's right. Suddenly, no control works, not even the off switch; camera is entirely locked up.No support phone number in the manual so search for it on the Web. I have spent the last two and a half hours trying to reach customer support at Panasonic. I have gone into limbo; been disconnected; had the line answered by an operator 3 times; been answered by one other person who said she is transferring me to the correct agent (that line has been on hold for 32 minutes at this point); etc, etc; been asked to enter full model number omitting no letters or numbers, a challenge when calling on a Blackberry, etc, etc; .  Operator has told me that all the problems are  to a system upgrade.  (What was it like before the upgrade? &lt;joke>  More seriously, what kind of idiot puts in upgrades to mission critical contact center software during business hours?)So I have fully lit up but dead camera; on/off doesn't even work. It is zoomed and I need to figure out how to unzoom it (zoom switch doesn't work) so I can fit it into the box and in utter frustration and disappointment return it to Amazon.And now, 37 minutes into my call being on hold I get an agent who tells me that there is no reason this should have happened; he can't explain it.  I ask for a return authorization.  He says they'll have it picked up for repair. I say 'unacceptable'.  He says he will transfer me to 2nd level support. Instead, he transfers me back to the beginning--and 'the voice' asks me why I am calling.  I tell it 'technical support' and it says 'sorry--we are now closed.'The hell with Panasonic. I am really disappointed - bought this for a trip to the Caymans next week.  It is going back to Amazon tomorrow.PS - another trio of Panasonic 'joy killers' (not misrepresentations or anything, just things that may impact the quality of your experience as a consumer):(1) No card ships with camera.(2) Battery does not come charged, so when you get excited as you get it out of the box you have to wait 4.3 hours for a charge before you can play with your new camera.(3) Manual is provided on CD only (unless you count all 18 pages of instructions in the 'Basic Owner's Manual').Boy, does the excitement fade quickly.UPDATE.  Last night I finally sent them an email saying that it was impossible to call them and I had spent 2 hours trying; would they be so kind as to call me.  They replied this morning (12 hour turnaround, not bad for email help request) but they said 'please call us for assistance'.  I replied 'Please call me; I was too frustrated by my experience to try to call you guys.'FURTHER UPDATE.  2 days later, no reply.  I have a return authorisation from Amazon.  Camera has behaved and not locked up again.  Not sure what I am going to do.""
"20120508","4.0","Extremely fun camera with great zoom, speed, and panorama","Product is very easy to use but a bit too small for my hand. Very portable due to its size, yet has fantastic reach. Color is a too strong using 'Happy' mode. The Panorama and Hand-held Night Shot mode is amazingly fun. Drains the battery extremely fast even when GPS is off. You would need to get at least 1 spare battery, for a full day shooting, you would probably need 2 spare batteries. Must get an external battery charger for the spares since it takes quite a long time for charging. Very fast to start up to take pictures. Highly recommended except for its battery life and the cost for spare batteries. The batteries do not last over 180 shots even without using flash. Buy it.""
"20120507","4.0","Small camera w/big zoom","I previously owned the Lumix DMC-TZ5. I think I have had it for about 5 years now and I have a lot of really good pictures from it. The screen just recently cracked in the corner and turned black, but it still works well. I bought the Sony DSC-HX9V because Cnet gave it such a good review, but I took it back because I didn't like the pictures. They looked too soft or more like a water color painting to me. I was waiting for a new and better camera that was pocket size, but with long zoom. I bought the ZS20 because it has everything I wanted plus some. The things that I wanted most were the long zoom, HD video, and good picture quality. It has that and more. The other things that are nice is that it has high speed video, panoramic, GPS, face recognition, and speedy auto focus. It also has a touch screen which I personally like. I like it because you don't have to use the touch screen for everything, only for a few of the controls. You can touch a person or object on the screen and it will focus and take a picture. The other thing is that if you use the zoom on the screen it will zoom all the way to 20x automatically. If you want to zoom in slow or only half way than you can use the finger zoom in front of the shutter button. You can also turn off the touch on the screen if you don't want to use it.  I actually haven't taken very many pictures with it yet, but so far it is nice. One thing I have noticed though is when you take a picture in low light the lens sticks out so far that the flash creates a shadow in the bottom left corner of the picture because the lens is in the way. That is miner to me though because I would rather have the long lens then not. I have used the video on the camera about three times now and it seems to me that sometimes the video will speed up slightly when it is played back on my computer. I am going to keep using it, but if it does it on every video I might have a defective camera. The GPS also uses the battery up fast. The battery charges in the camera now which would be nice while I am traveling, but it sucks at home because you can't use the camera and charge it at the same time. The camera has to be off to charge. The first day I got it the battery died really fast because it wasn't charged all the way so I had to let it charge up before I could start playing with it again. I definitely need to get more batteries and a wall charger. I like the GPS though. I turn it off when I am taking pictures around the house, but when I use it everywhere else I like to have the GPS on so I can see on Google Earth the exact spot I took the picture. If you download Picasa and Google Earth. It will show you right where you took the picture on a Google earth map, and I can see other pictures people have taken and shared. So far this camera is pretty nice and it is a keeper. The only thing that really sucks is that by the time I got the camera with 2 day shipping the camera was already $40 dollars cheaper.UPDATE: Has anyone else had a problem with the video speeding up for a second here and there? I'm sending mine back because mine does. FYI Amazon sent me a broken camera so i sent it back for a refund and they charged me an Item Promotion Deduction*: ($8.79). Not ever buying electronics online because if you ever have any problems with them it is a pain.""
"20120507","4.0","Panasonic up in coming!","The Lumix ZS20 is a great point and shoot camera. Not bulky, and easy to fit in your pocket. With the 20x Optical zoom it has, you can catch great photos from a distance. A nice 3' TOUCH screen display, allows you to tap and focus on an object. One thing i dont like though, at times it can be slow at focusing on the object. But a feature that I like, that a lot of cameras besides Sony don't have is the Panorama scene. Allows you to take various forms of panorama pictures.I would recommend this camera, Panasonic Lumix is a great model.""
"20120506","4.0","Hard to expect more from a camera this size","Just returned from a canoe trip where i left the DSLR and video equipment at home and used this as my primary photo and video camera. The best way i can say it is WOW. This camera takes some very good pictures and video. No, it's not going to match that of high end full body equipment, but if you're just looking for something to take good photos to share with friends and family, this thing does so very well. A nice wide angle, a telephoto that while it does loose some saturation and sharpness, is very functional (and beats the heck out of the typical 4-10x), stabilization works well, nice color, does a lot of things in full auto well, boots up fast, focuses well, video quality is adequate to very good, low light level performance is reasonable, it's manual functions are decent, and it all fits in a shirt pocket and costs under $300. My only complaint? White balance indoors, but that's easy enough to get around with the flash or manual calibration. Nice job Panasonic, you still have the best pocket ultra zoom on the market imho.""

"20120430","4.0","Excellent camera","I've had the camera about 2 weeks. It replaces an older 6x optical/5MP model. The older model uses AA batteries which I prefer, but can live with the new proprietary battery. The biggest concern was a reviewer who said the start-up time was a little slow on the new camera. I find it to be just as quick as the old model, and far quicker than several Kodaks owned in years past. The lens protection shutter on the new camera seems to hang up a little on closing. The same shutter on the old model would stick half way open which led to gluing it in the open position and it has worked fine that way for several years. The paper manual is small with lots of precautions about using proper battery, etc. While the charging cable has a USB connector, you have to look at the larger, 197 page, manual provided on a DVD to find that your computer can be a power source. A computer IS needed to see the manual! The ZS20 screen is larger with better resolution causing onlookers to comment about how nice images are on it. At full range the 20x creates very little problem with movement distortion but some difference in multiple shots can be seen. I live on a river 6 miles wide and boats photographed about 4 miles out appeared pretty sharp in most digitally enlarged shots. It has more bells and whistles I probably won't use, like stereo digital sound recording and GPS. GPS draws power even with the camera off, unless disabled! It's just as compact as the old camera and is light weight, but more suitable for belt-mount, than a pocket. The old model was the same. It will take larger capacity memory chips, but seems limited to battery life for any video efforts longer than about 30 mins. With just a little more engineering it looks like a smart phone could have been included...Update: May 11, 2012Still very impressed and after my son saw it and liked it, we ordered one for him as a birthday present along with extra batteries, a case and a SD card!  I like the Case Logic we got for me and him that shows as an option under the camera on Amazon. It just fits, has a separate zipped space that nicely holds a spare battery, camera fits just right, and it comes with a detachable D-ring and separate belt loop. Padding is just enough to protect if dropped onto the sidewalk I think.I'm finding it a slow learning process. Selecting features is time-consuming. I wanted to program one of the 'C' settings so it would always allow the 42x zoom, but am not sure how to make the changes and when I finally stumbled on how to do it, they would not stay permanent. Need a 'Dummy' book.The manual on page 75 finally shows all the icons on the screen, what they stand for and which pages discusses them.The jitter demo feature is useful to show how hard it is to hold the camera perfectly still. And at 42x it's impossible to stop the shake while hand-holding. (The anti-jitter mode is also turned off for that, I think, which raises the question of why when this is when it is most needed.)  I'm looking for a uni-pod. It sounds more versatile than a tripod. Be nice to find one that doubles as a walking stick...!""

"20120419","2.0","Small Camera with Great Zoom but Poor Pic Quality, A bad Copy?","My Boss lady bought this camera as soon as it was available couple weeks ago.  The same day she got it she decided to return the camera.  She complained the picture qualities were not as sharp as her other older compact cameras.  I asked her to try a couple days and get use to the way the camera take pictures.  She brought to work and we tried different settings(ISO, Iauto, P, S, A,...etc) and shooting conditions indoor, outdoor, macro, zoom(mid to long).  I had to agree, for some reason the ZS20 is not taking as sharp picture as my dad's ZS7 or my Panasonic LX5.  I know it's comparing to orange to an apple when it is compare to LX5 but it's hard to keep the camera when the only decent pictures we got were macro shots.  Everything else was too pixelated on my 24in monitor even the ones with ample daylight. She end up taking her Canon T2i and Olympus EPL1 with her on family trip and returned the ZS20.The camera is amazingly small(with the mega zoom lens it is even a bit smaller than my LX5, but this can also be a problem if you have a big hand....) and zoom is great if you do not care the pictures are not going to be sharp.  We don't know if we had a bad copy or not but my boss lady doesn't want to spend more shipping cost to find out~The buttons and menus on the ZS20 is very similar to other Panasonic compact camera families(at least compare to older ZS and LX5).  So if you had an older Panasonic, learning curve on this camera is very fast.""
"20120419","5.0","Panasonic ZS20 great mega zoom point and shoot camera","First, I consider myself a serious hobbyist when it comes to photography. I've been shooting with Nikon DSLR's for several years (currently using a D300s). I shoot RAW images only and process everything in Lightroom. You can visit my website and have a look. I live in Miami, FL, so there's a lot of local stuff, but also travel galleries. I love birding and I'm often in the Everglades. [...]That being said, I always carry a P&S camera. I have a young daughter and I like to have more than a cell phone camera handy. I also do not like lugging the heavy gear to kids events, etc. For years, it's always been a Canon P&S for me. I had a very hard time finding just the right upgrade this time, with all the new mega zooms now entering the market. However, I didn't see anything out there that beats the Panasonic in price and features.Overall, I really like the ZS20.  It's full of features and includes an HDR setting and Pano mode (which is amazing I might add). I keep GPS turned off to save battery.  Keep in mind, this battery drains quickly if you are like me and you take pictures, videos, go in and out of the menus and are constantly reviewing your images. I purchased a couple of spare batteries and the external battery charger.  Sorry, but the USB to camera charging system sucks and the cable couldn't be any shorter! Keep with the Panasonic original batteries only and keep a few charged and on hand when shooting.Picture quality outside in good lighting is excellent. Shooting 1080p video on this camera is awesome and iMovie recognizes my clips and brings them right into the program. Indoors, I'm still struggling to get a crisp shot. I do find the images noisy, just as I have read online in other reviews. I haven't played around enough with the settings to try to do better, which I do believe I can do. I love that this camera has A, P and M mode, plus 2 custom functions. I find the placement of buttons to be comfortable and love the grip.I will keep experimenting and will update my review if I encounter something worth updating.  Keep checking my Flickr galleries, as I will continue to add test shots. The images on Flickr are straight out of the camera images (no editing). Please visit the site if you want to check out what the camera can do. Also check out the gallery of our new puppy, which were also test shots taken with this camera with no editing. [...]""
"20120414","5.0","Excellent!","Video is smooth and high quality.  Control and button placement is good and easy to use especially for video with its own button on top.  You can take still photos while recording videos.  Telephoto works while shooting videos.  Single photo 20x and extended 40x telephoto works well and focus stays sharp. GPS tagging works well for me with Map Flickr and Flickr and will make for a nice trip display for photos taken in the same trip.  The map data downloaded to the SD chip without a problem and the maps make for a nice on-camera display of the locations the photos were taken.  GPS tagging with the actual name of the location and not just coordinates is a feature I wasn't finding in other cameras. It's easy to burn through the battery in 1 to 2 hours while trying out all the features.  I've ordered two more batteries to ensure more picture and video taking time.  I like the up to 60 picture per second bursts and the more controlled 2 to 10 fps bursts.  Reviewing and deleting photos is intuitive and easy.  The ability to touch the screen to tell the camera the focus of the photo is useful on a moving object like wildlife.  The up to 14M photos are the best I've taken with a digital camera.  USB charging is very useful.  I've ordered an AC wall charger to be used charging back-up batteries while the camera is in use. I'm glad I waited for the ZS20 to be released and didn't get the new Nicon or Canon telephoto versions. Smallest of the 20X cameras I was interested in.  A great buy for less than $300.""

I've tried other pocket cameras that claim 10fps but didn't deliver. Shots of kids playing, sports and pets in full flight will not be missed. I also like some aspects of the touch screen functions. You can touch a subject anywhere within the frame and the ZS20 will instantly focus on it and immediately shoot the picture. For the time being at least this has to be the best travelzoom around. It's small enough to be a constant companion on my belt and fast enough to fire at a moments notice. Definately a keeper.""

I purchased the ZS-10 and was disappointed with the low-light performance to the extent of returning it. The ZS-20 is a major improvement over the ZS-10.I have taken only 100-200 pictures but the low light performance is much better and comparable (or slightly better) to the ZS-3.

Might be because of the extended zoomOverallGreat compact superzoom, small, light and produce great pictures. Does well what its intended to do.UPDATE: April 9- Learning curve for touch screen is faster than I originally felt- Video looks great at good light, low light performance for video is not great compared to my panasonic camcoder- HDR works great with minor caveat - do not shoot moving objects as the processing gets confused and the blended picture includes multiple fragments of the moving object (in my case kids). I believe this is an issue on all HDR's - general recommendation, always take an extra pic on no HDR since a garbled HDR picture is useless- Macro works great- I played with custom setting on the dial which mitigates the multiple switches and dials this to some extend. For example, relatively easy managed to setup custom scene for HDR so to switch from HDR to iA is just a turn of dialStill very positive on the camera, great buy. Easily fits into my pocketUPDATE: April 22- Zooming on video adds a slight humm noise to the soundtrack- Touch screen is great! - I love the fact that you can just touch the specific object you want to focus on and have the camera focus on it and immediately take a picture.

One thing for all to note if you are familiar with this series is that the battery must now be charged in camera with a short USB cable to a Panasonic wall charger. For me, this is a disadvantage, since I have enjoyed the flexibility of the previous arrangement -- a dedicated charger into which the battery is placed outside of the camera. I found this 'old' setup to be more convenient and easier to use when traveling, and easier to pack. Maybe this is not a problem for you, but it was an unpleasant surprise for me. As others have noted, though, the old charger works with this battery (same battery as before), so you can easily purchase a stand-alone charger.Update 4-6-12I have now taken some representative shots with the camera and have some observations. Like the previous three models, the display on this one is not ideal in bright sunlight, although it is acceptable. To my eye, the photos are really good for the category, and an improvement on the previous models. Having the extra zoom is quite nice. I have always enjoyed the Lumix menu system, which is fairly intuitive in this segment.Since many of you are interested in the low light issues, I have taken some extremely low light shots and looked at them closely after enlarging. I find them quite good, and remarkable with a small sensor. I took a shot today, in one of our classrooms with no lights on, only illumination from an outside door half panel over 50 feet away. I cannot imagine better results with a camera this size with such challenging light.I also took some photos outside with both bright sunlight and deep shadows in the shot. The photos were excellent, rendering detail in both the sunlit elements (as expected) and in the deep, dark shadows (pleasant surprise).I have not made use of the touchscreen features yet, so I cannot comment on their usefulness. I assume they will be helpful in some situations.All in all, this is an nice update to the previous models and I am sure will serve me well in my travels. It remains easily pocketable, easy to use and full of features to experiment with and explore. The compromises are few and the benefits are many.""
