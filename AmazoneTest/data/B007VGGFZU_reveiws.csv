"20120609","5.0","Nikon D3200 is Great!","I purchased the Nikon D3200 as a replacement for my older Nikon D70 and I am not disappointed! This camera 'navigates' like my older Nikon so I did not have to relearn anything in that regard. And the newer features were very easy to learn. In fact, I took the camera to Europe for 3 weeks only days after it's arrival and was perfectly comfortable and proficient with it immediately!The autofocus is outstanding and super intuitive. The speed in which I can take rapid, multiple shots is amazing and the overall feel and weight make the camera very comfortable to carry for long periods and to use quickly!""
"20120605","5.0","Impressive!!!","I was looking for something simple with high MP to mix with good lenses. This is a good buy. The video is fantastic still sots are about 5-6 MB at large.""
"20120604","5.0","Well, I guess the pictures are enough not to say any other word","I was very interested since it was announced and finally sold my D90 which I love forever and was my best nonliving friend since my son was born and bought this. although I was hesitant to sell D90 but I guess now the new little brother has a lot to say comparing to it.Pictures are really vivid, great colors and much more closer to real colors of the environment, focusing is not different from D90 although is accurate and fast enough, it is very handy and much more lighter than D90 and handling is quite easy. the settings are very easily adjusted and lacking the other dial is really not making any difference to me at all.I did not even use the 18-55mm lens and since I opened the box I added my Nikkor 35-f1.8 which is a huge addon to this camera.resolution is interestigly not double but triple or more of the D90 actually. I know it is only twice of that but really much more improvement you'll see when compare those two.colors, colors, colors, I love those. I am sure no other camera with in this price range can be compared to it. and even better ones can pass the scores in a hard way.it is magnificent and no one will regret buying it.Thank you Nikon.Update 06/08/12:I can't resist my temptation to state that it is more than what someone can expect from a $700 DSLR. the pictures are magnificent. Focusing is really fast and accurate even in total darkness. I love this box and happy for exchanging it with my D90. Resolution is unbilievably high and colors are really vivid. I have uploaded a few flower pictures in full resolution.Best purchase ever for $700.""
"20120601","5.0","Nikon D3200 24.2 MP DSLR","I just received this camera 3 days ago but have already run at least 250-300 frames with it.  The performance is amazing in addition to the 18-55 kit lens being outstanding.  I also purchased a Nikon 35mm lens to go with the camera and will review it after working with it.All of the controls on the D3200 seem to be placed with care and are so intuitive to use that I feel like I've had the camera for years.  The menu system is also quite intuitive and anyone who has ever used a DSLR before (whether Nikon or not) will find it very easy to work with.The material the camera is made from appears to be quite sturdy as does the construction of the camera.  A typical Nikon product...excellent.  The feel of the D3200 is quite good.  The only thing I'd change is the grip.  As other reviews have stated, it appears to be made for smaller hands.  But certainly not a deal breaker.I'd recommend anyone interested in using a great camera to buy this model.""
"20120601","4.0","A decent DSLR overall with a couple of issues","In terms of photographic usability... the Nikon D3200 is excellent. It's fast, comfortable to hold and shoot with, the menu system is intuitive, and LCD is much improved over the D3100. It feels solid and well-made and could stand up to the weight of a more pro-grade lens.I have to say though... if you're thinking about upgrading from the D3100 thinking you will get better image quality out of this camera... then you might be disappointed. I think the image quality is very good but not spectacular. My main problems are two things: 1) The camera routinely overexposes and 2) It appears that there is a fair amount of detail smearing due to noise reduction. This becomes noticeable especially at ISO800 and upwards (JPEG). If you shoot RAW, of course, then you can tweak the settings to your liking. But since this is a consumer-oriented camera... many people at first will want to use the pictures straight out of the camera. To be fair... on the overexposing issue, this isn't the first Nikon with this issue and it's easily correctable by applying negative compensation. Nikon made a bold move with this camera to include such a high-megapixel sensor (24MP). But you have to consider that the upcoming Pentax K-30 and Canon T4i DSLRs are using re-worked versions of their 16 and 18 megapixel sensors respectively, which I am almost 100% certain both of those will have a clear advantage in image quality over the D3200 (maybe not in other areas of performance though). You also have Nikon's own 16MP D5100 which shoots cleaner files than this does at higher ISOs. That's not to say that this camera isn't capable of taking decent shots... it is. And I think Nikon has done a bit of a better job with their 24MP sensor vs. Sony. But it would be pure dishonesty and/or ignorance for a salesman to tell that this has better overall image quality than its peers solely on the basis of its higher megapixel count.One disappointing feature that was on the D3100 but not of the D3200 is the drive mode switch on the top of the camera near the mode-dial. Also the switch between movie and video has been replaced with a button.The video is pretty good on this camera. I have not messed around too much with the video but from the footage I have taken so far, the video has been sharp and clean.So, gripes on the image quality aside, the D3200 is a great camera. The person who buys this camera will certainly enjoy using it, especially since there is a huge performance boost over its predecessor. Just watch the exposure and consider shooting RAW for most of your higher ISO work.""
"20120601","5.0","Nikon D3200","The Nikon 3200 is a special treat in the Nikon lineup. The 24.2 sensor is usually found in the much more expensive Cameras. The guided settings prove to help in unusual environments were you don't have time to experiment. Bought this for my wife to replace our well worn D70. Very nice improvement and the 1080 HD video is a welcome addition. Even better my all of my lenses work with this camera.""
"20120601","4.0","Awesome Camera","Camera is ultimate. Features are user friendly. Battery lasts for a longer time. It was good if bigger range lens was provided. you cannot do much with this small lens.""
"20120531","4.0","Good entry level DSLR","D3200 is a good entry level camera. 24MP may be too much at this level, however. Even when using a prime lens (35mm/1.8 in my case) I can still see noticeable softness when viewing images at 100%. Even more so when using the 18-55mm kit lens. Still, there is more resolution in images under ideal conditions compared to the D5100, which I also own. Overall I prefer the D5100 images for sharpness, dynamic range, colors and low light noise.One other thing I noticed with my D3200 is that the VR on the kit lens can introduce blurring of images. Shooting at 55mm and 1/100 shutter speed (which Auto ISO and auto min shutter speed option will select and should be considered sufficient to eliminate camera shake) causes shaking which is visible in images. Only when switching VR off that blurriness is gone (this also means I can hold the camera steady enough). Also, I could observe the same with the 55-200mm lens at 55mm. So I don't think it is a lens issue. So I will keep VR on the kit lens off when shooting in good light. For the 55-200 however this is more complicated as at the 200mm tele end the VR switched on seems always better.Edit: upgraded the rating to 4/5 stars since there is a workaround to the issues I found. Also, I didn't want this review to be seen as negative.Update: The image softness at 100% pixel level is caused by the in camera jpeg processing. I just developed some of the RAW/NEF images taken with the 35/1.8 lens in good light and low ISO and they come out clear and sharp at the pixel level (with a little extra sharpening applied). Also there is more detail in areas of lower contrast from the NEF developed images compared to the jpegs from the camera.""
"20120530","4.0","Good camera, but have to send it back","Very good camera, a little bit small for my hands, but very light.It makes pretty good picture, no questions. Why only four stars? And why I want to return it...OK, there is a huge deal breaker for me - no FP mode. Yes, I know, it's totally my fault, I should read spec more carefully. I bought this camera in a single click after reading a general spec. I have the d90 and was interesting in more cropping ability, I don't care about video, I have a good camcorder, but I do need a better low light performance with higher ISO. My d90 is best camera ever, but I don't like to go with it above iso 400, even with ISO 400 noise is noticeable.I'm not a pro. I'm just taking pictures of my  18  months daughter, a lot of pictures, almost every day.I mostly do it at home and use sb-900 flash with various lenses. And now you probably understand why high synchronization speed is so crucial for me. The d3200 allows you to shoot with  flash using 1/200 exposure or higher (slower), it's definitely not enough for my high speed baby :-)Also, imaging you are shooting portrait against a sun, you have to use a fill flash and you also want to preserve thin DOF to get a nice blurry background, it is also impossible with d3200.About pictures quality - I didn't notice significant difference between d3200 and d90. My old and lovely d90 still very sharp. I've tried  Nikkor 50/1.8g and Sigma 17-50/2.8. In terms of sharpness and focus accuracy my 50 mm is doing better on d90, Sigma is my flagship for indoor shooting is doing pretty similar and very well on both bodies. I have not tried 18-200vr yet, I'm planning to try it over the next weekend. I also have a 60mm d macro and 105mm/f2 love to use them on d90, but they are both D and will not auto focus on d3200. The only gain that I see with using d3200 it's a much lower noise between ISO 400 and 1600 (compare to d90), but don't go higher. D3200 produces better colors and of course much more details (thanks to 24mp sensor). I didn't play with raw on d3200.Almost forgot, the face recognition is not that good compare to even some p&s, many times d3200 focus has been jumped between my daughter face and her toys, especially balls. I also like 3d tracking in my d90 much more, it's more accurate. The d3200 is not always can predict movement direction and set focus correct in 3d mode.So, I have pretty mixed feeling about d3200. It's a nice camera and could be a perfect walk around camera, this is a good and light backup camera, this is even nice prime camera if you don't use flash much as I do. But it doesn't work for me. Just one more feature and this camera could be a champion, but no FP HSS means no deal for me.Sorry Amazon, I'm really love your  30 days return policy, It's not my usual practice, but this time I have to return this little baby, it doesn't feet my needs.Bottom line: I would recommend this camera as a first slr camera to people who want to advance their photography experience and people who like to control their cameras settings. Good luck to all of you!""
"20120530","5.0","Preliminary impression: Love at first sight!","Since I went all-digital ten years ago, I've used nothing but Nikon DSLRs (D-100, D-70, D-200, D-300), and now the D3200. With several DX lenses, I'm committed to the small AP sensors, so I was elated to see Nikon come up with the D3200. So far, I'm very impressed. The camera body is so compact and lightweight, you have to hold one in your own hands to fully appreciate it.It will take some getting used to having fewer buttons and controlling most functions with the multi-selector, but after a couple of days, I'm getting the hang of it. The learning curve isn't too steep.I haven't tried shooting flash yet with my SB-800, but the built-in pop-up flash works very well.After I get through checking out the camera, I'll probably keep my 18-200mm DX zoom lens on most of the time, but for everyday casual shooting, the 18-55mm kit lens is giving very nice results, and its light weight goes perfectly with the D3200 camera body.This is no stripped-down entry level camera. It has most of the functions and capabilities of my far-more-expensive (and much heavier) D-300. A novice could use it as a point-and-shoot, but an advanced photographer could have complete control over their shots. And having 24 megapixels to work with while editing images is awesome.So the bottom line is that for me, the D3200 was love at first sight. Please note that I did a separate review of the Nikkor 18-55mm zoom lens that came with the camera body in the kit.I'll update my review as I get more experience with the camera.Note: If you have older Nikon DSLRs, your CF memory cards won't work in the D3200, nor will your batteries. The D3200 uses SDHC memory cards, and the battery is an EN-EL14, not the EN-EL3e that some of the earlier models used.UPDATE (June 3, 2012): I've used the D3200 for a week now, and I'm even more impressed with it than I was initially. There are a few functions of my old D300 that aren't available on the D3200, but they aren't functions that I used very much, if ever. To me, the benefits of a smaller, much lighter camera body more than outweigh the negatives. Also, I've used my Nikon SB-800 flash on the camera, and the camera and flash work very well together.""
"20120530","5.0","Love this camera","D3200 is my first SLR camera and I LOVE IT!!!!  I have been researching and reading a lot of reviews and when the most recent review came out on this, I didn't hesitate and purchased it.  I have mostly used the automatic settings and I am extremely pleased with the quality of the pictures.  I have purchased the D3200 for Dummies book and I am looking forward to getting to know a bit more about it's capabilities.  I can't stop taking pictures.  With time, I will be purchasing a larger zoom lens.  The current one is fantastic but I want to be able to do more with it.""
"20120530","5.0","Outrageous Camera for the Price!!","I was planning on purchasing a Nikon D7000, but then found out about this camera.  Reading on the Nikon Rumors site, it appears that the D7000 may be replaced with a higher MP sensor (24.2 - same as the D3200) sometime this fall.Not wanting to wait, I thought I'd give the D3200 a try.  I still had to wait a bit, but finally got one from Amazon for $699 with Prime.This thing is NOT a toy!! It is a serious piece of camera gear, and if you spend time getting to understand all it can do, it will pay off handsomely with incredible pictures. I would also recommend getting a good Digital Image Management program to get the most out of your pictures (I'm using Adobe LightRoom 3).Doing some test shots with the D3200, those extra MegaPixels DO count, if you know what you are doing.  My brother-in-law (who just bought a Nikon D800 for $3,000 with no lens) was surprised at a shot I took at 6000x4000 JPG resolution, hand-held with available light at 1/20th of a second with the 'stock' lens that comes with the camera.  You can blow the picture up to 36' and still not see any blur!  You can get even HIGHER quality pictures by shooting in RAW format....Exposure bracketing is the only thing missing, IMO, but if they threw that in NOBODY would buy the D5100 or D7000 - it's that good.P.S. Make sure you get a HIGH Quality memory card to go with this camera. I got the SanDisk Extreme 32GB 45MB/s SDHC Flash Memory Card (from Amazon, of course) and it's a great combo for burst shooting or HD Video use.""
"20120530","5.0","All Nonsense!!","The only purpose for all these new High Mega Pixel cameras is to fill out your hard drive space at home. This will be good for the economy, specially for the PC industry. The new mentality from the camera indistry is to 'brain wash' you, specially newer younger generation of kids that don't have a CLUE of what photography is about, and by giving cameras a 'larger' mega pixel number they think they are getting a better camera. Sure, if you are going to be printing out POSTER SIZE photos then yes, please get one of these and set the IMAGE QUALITY to LARGE/LARGE and you will start seeing how fast your hard drive fills out. These newer cameras do not make 'BETTER' photos.The EXPEED 3 processors does not have anything to do with the photo quality what so ever, but mainly for better VIDEO and other little technical functions of the camera such as image download and refreshing. I have the D7000 and i dont even use it at 16MP, i have it set to MEDIUM and sometimes SMALL. In fact if you want SHARPER photos DO NOT set the image quality to a larger size. When you set the Image quality to LARGE or THE HIGHEST MEGA PIXEL, if you are just printing 4x6 or even 8x10 your photos will come out smoother or more blurry. I am not buying this camera because i dont need such thing, i am just letting you know what the camera industry is not telling you. Their job is just to sell it to you. I am sure this is a really good camera, just make sure you know what you are doing if you are new to photography or want to upgrade from a D40 or something.""
"20120526","5.0","A lot of value for the money","The D3200 is a brilliant camera for intermediate to advanced users. Beginners can of course use it too due to the pre-programmed shooting modes.Besides the pre-programmed shooting modes it is literally loaded with advanced features which is a huge advantage for the experienced user.The Info screen gives quick access to often used setup items like image quality, white balance, release mode etc. and the programmable Fn button on the left sideon the front gives quick access to setting the ISO (by default).So don't get fooled by the low price, this is really a great camera with excellent output and I would say that it could easily be used by professional photographerswith a good lens mounted (at least as a backup camera).I have owned several Nikons including the D700 and my conclusion is that you can't go wrong with this camera, but be aware that the image files are quite largeespecially if shooting NEF (raw).""
"20120525","5.0","Until my D800e get here.","I sold my D7000 as I ordered a D800e in Feburary.  Chances of getting it before the summer travels I have planned are slim to none.  Then Nikon brought the D3200 out, and you can actually buy them now.  I would much rather have this than a D7000.  It is lighter, just as good at the stuff I shoot and cost less.  With a 24 megapixel sensor, I can shoot my Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8 II without a TC17e II and crop to get in close on wild animals.  Nikon is finally earning the loyalty I have given them for the last 25 years.""
"20120521","4.0","An excellent camera but a questionable upgrade from the D3100","This camera looks and feels just like the camera it will ultimately replace, the Nikon D3100.  The major difference between these two cameras is the D3200's new sony sensor with much higher resolution; 24MP vs 14MP for the D3100.  The LCD screen on the D3200 also appears brighter and sharper than the D3100 LCD (but not movable like the D5100 LCD Screen)  Photographs taken with the D3200 in good light (ie up to ISO 800) are richly saturated and highly detailed.  The only quibbles I have (and this is also true for the D3100 and D5100) is the Automatic White Balance bias towards yellow under incandescent lighting resulting in an artificially warm look. Manual adjustment of the white balance is necessary to achieve better color accuracy indoors. There is no dedicated White Balance button or white balance bracketing option.  Also, the camera (a bit more than previous lower end Nikons) tends to overexpose quite a bit outdoors and underexpose sometimes indoors.  This is easily fixed by adusting the exposure compensation setting or by spot metering.  This camera (as does the D3100 & D5100) uses the EN-EL14 battery.  Only a battery actually manufactured by Nikon ($40+) and not a generic 3rd party battery will work.  Consequently, having a spare battery is a bit of a luxury with this camera.  The megapixel count of the D3200 is probably overkill for most people especially this camera's target audience.  The D3100 megapixel count is more than sufficient unless you plan to print highway billboards. The file size of .jpg files generated by the D3200 is over 11MB (almost the size of the D40's raw files).  An advantage of these larger resolution files is the ability to perform cropping without any concern for the smaller remaining file size.  The dynamic range of this camera for .jpg files appears about the same as the D3100 and D5100 at base ISO using the kit lens (and Active D-Lighting turned on).  Using a better lens, the dynamic range appears slightly better than the D3100 and slightly worse than the D5100.  These differences are really very subtle and are based upon visual observations, nothing scientific.  There is a downside to the D3200 higher resolution; some increased visible noise at high ISO levels specifically at ISO 1600 and 3200 reminiscent of the D3000.  Comparing photographs taken on identical subjects at identical conditions at 1600 or 3200 ISO on the D3100 and D3200, definitely shows cleaner photographs on the D3100 (and the D5100).  It would be helpful if there was more than one ISO stop between 800 and 3200 (there is just 1600) as well as a dedicated ISO button so that one didn't have to click through a menu to adjust the ISO.  In summary, the D3200 is an excellent camera but not a worthwhile upgrade in my opinion from the D3100 unless you like to really crop your photographs and do not generally shoot above ISO 800. Incidentally,  I did not use the  video so I can not comment on that aspect.6-4-12 UPDATE:  Within the last day or so, CNET and Cameralabs.com have each issued their respective comprehensive reviews of the D3200.  These are the first actual reviews by a major web site of the D3200 that I am aware of.  These reviews confirm that although the D3200 has some improved specifications over the D3100 (higher resolution for sure), the image quality of the older (and less expensive) D3100 is better than the D3200.  Specifically CameraLabs rated the image quality of the D3100 18/20 and the image quality of the D3200 17/20.  Consequently if image quality and value are primary considerations, the D3100 should be given strong consideration over the D3200 in my opinion.""
"20120516","5.0","Companion for my D3s","I purchased this camera to use it for landscapes or situations where high resolution is really preferred. The 60fps video is awsome for slow motion video.Overall, it's a pretty decent camera with crazy resolution at a very nice price tag.""
"20120512","5.0","Baby D800 ??","I had no plans to buy this camera, but eventually had to find a solution while waiting for my D800 to be delivered. I kind of felt, I could get some training by shooting high megapixel images on this entry level camera.My first outing after the camera arrived was to some birdpark with absolutely no prior preparation. The manual is still in the box, only charged the battery overnight and brought a selection of lenses in addition to the kit lens.First surprise, even the kit 'plastic' lens performs really nicely on this camera. Due to the nature of the objects of interest, the remaining shoots were done on a 28-300mm.I was accompanied by an experienced bird photographer and we took turns with the camera. Both made the following observations: From the angle of experienced Nikon users, this camera offers everything in terms of menus and dials to set the camera up the way one is used to from D90, D7000, D300s level cameras. This came as a surprise, as the D3200 does not have the front dial that we both were used to and familiar with. Nikon has done an surprisingly good job in making the menus very easy to access and after a short while, we where entirely concentrated on the shoot and only occasionally reminding ourself that this was 'only' an entry-level DSLR.At the same time, we were impressed how nice the software is tailored to the needs of a potential beginner, gently guiding him towards to goal of making better photos along the way.The LCD screen on the back is a huge step forward from previous models, as it allowed to effortless pre-screen the shots taken. I was even carrying a laptop computer to better inspect the initial images, but after a short while we only resorted the the built-in screen.The biggest surprise was however the image quality after we analyzed our initial >350 photos on a large monitor. The yield of usable photos was right out of the box very high, which reiterates the ease of use of this camera and the great auto-focus system (despite only 11 sensors). Also the smallish size of the body turned out to be less problematic, even with a bigger lens attached to it.We found the image quality obtained to be absolutely stunning, the sharpness of the images was 'picture perfect'. Colors just the way one would expect them, as is the hall mark of any Nikon camera. Even small birds could be cropped from the 24 MP resulting in usable 7 MP images. Post-processing was a thrill and resulted in a substantial number of images clearly qualifying as publication quality.Having seen both, the best and the worst in Nikon cameras, I can verify that this entry level DSLR is a keeper. Even though never planned, it will stay in the collection as a second body and now serves as the main camera until the D800 arrives.If an entry level camera already is this good, what may be expected of the upcoming updates of the other DX models, the likes of D5100, D7000 and the D300s?""
"20120511","5.0","Finally","I am going to be honest, I have never owned a digital SLR camera (30 years old) even though I am very fond of photography as it is was my grandfather's profession in the early 20th century in Iran. This review is for those SLR beginners like myself. I have never had the money to spend on a digital SLR but since now we have twin boys at home and D3200 finally came out I felt justified to spend the extra bucks. Specially after being disappointed by and returning the Canon S100.I have had the D3200 for 5 days now and even though I have not had the chance to take it outside that much, here are my impressions:1. Pictures are amazingly crisp and true to the color, simply beautiful2. FPS is fast and satisfying (although, with flash, not always fast enough for two 14 month old boys!). Now I find myself capturing motions that I could have never done before (compare to S100 of course)3. Takes Amazing videos with great sound4. Love the view finder, specially, since in this camera it's smarter and more detailed/informative than most LCDs5. The manual booklet is a good start for someone like me, but you will have to do additional research and playing around to understand all the available options in the Menu6. The Modes are quite useful once you understand them7. The LCD screen is so well pixilated that you can see the quality of your pictures right there and then8. The camera is the perfect size (specially if you're on the move and have your hands full already like me), light wight and grips well9. Battery is still on the original charge after about 200 pics and 10 videosFinally, I ordered the Wifi module last week but seems like Amazon is not going to get it anytime soon! I can't wait to try this functionality with my android. I will update the review once I get that but overall we love the Camera as is.""
"20120510","5.0","Solid performer for the price.","I only really purchased this as a studio cam. Don't need AF performance for that, nor high ISO's, but do need great resolution. So, with trepidation and reserve, I decided to try this one. I am coming from D700's, D3's, D7k's and other as my point of reference. I shoot for a living.The good:Resolution is excellent, especially when coupled with the 40mm macro from Nikon. I have shot a few hundred shots now and am very happy in that regard. The menus are simple enough that you can work them out if you already know Nikon's systems for menus. AF performance is great for this kind of body. Using my 17-55 with it, I could acquire focus only slightly slower that with the D7000. I tried in lower light to see how that worked, and while you could tell it was slower, it was not too bad. Every shot I have taken bar one (black dog in a dark room), was in focus as intended. So, AF is good for this kind of body. I like the layout of the controls too, everything was where it was expected to be.The bad:Small body means uncomfortable grip. However, that is what was expected, so I don't really think this is a 'bad' for this camera. I expect a person with smaller hands will thoroughly enjoy that aspect. Lenses (all but smaller ones) are front heavy and fell off balance. Pop a 70-200 VR on this and it is silly unless you carry/hold it by the lens primarily. Lastly, there is no AF fine tune, but.... I have not found the need on even one of the lenses I will use it with to make any adjustments, so not too bad a thing.Conclusion:Get one if you want it for landscape, low speed portraits (esp families) or for product/architecture. I highly recommend it.""
"20120508","5.0","Amazing camera -  D800 replacement?","Like many folks, I pre-ordered the D800 the same day it was available.  Alas, Nikon totally blew the market analysis vs production vs. supply chain formula.  After waiting 2 months, I had to leave the country before Nikon got it's D800 act together. I needed a beat-up D90 replacement camera, and the D3200 seemed like a decent place-holder.  I quickly ordered one before they were back-ordered too!  Sure, the D3200 is DX, not FX.  Sure, it is not nearly as flexible.  Sure, it can only AF with newer lenses.  BUT, you can buy about 4-D3200's for the price of a D800, AND it comes with a decent kit lens for $699!The tutoring graphical-based menu system is geared more to beginners, which I am not, so I find it maddening.  Most will love it, since it is somewhat educational, and offers a great variety of pre-sets to take creative shots easily.It is amazingly light weight - lighter than most lenses! It is very quiet. The AF could be faster, but it's plenty fast enough. When you dig deeper, you shockingly find that the D3200 has many advanced internal features from the highest-end cameras (D800 & F4). The high-res LCD rear screen, the EXPEED 3 image processing engine, and a new 24MP sensor.  The EXPEED 3 image processing engine allows the D3200 to perform at an altitude unheard of for a so-called entry level camera.  Nikon's Active-D dynamic range enhancement at 24MP at 4 frames per second requires substantial in-camera processing power. The amazing slo-mo HD video offerings just wouldn't be possible without this pro-level image processing engine.I bought this camera primarily for still photography. With the proper lenses & technique, the results are stunning.  Low-light/high ISO performance is far beyond what you should expect at this level camera. Candle-lit face images are noise-free, and look great. Still life's on a tripod at ISO 100, have more resolution that ANY DSLR I have ever used, with very little shadow noise.  In short, I might not accept my D800 when it becomes available.  I might use the D3200 longer than I thought, (waiting for the 24MP FX D600 for $1999 later this year -- my guesses on price & stats & date)...or, just keep using the D3200.  If it breaks (I'm hard on cameras), I'll just buy a new one.Bottom line -- the D3200: super light-weight, very quiet, super high resolution (& low noise, high dynamic range, superb colors), incredible HD video with slow motion.  It is no doubt THE most amazing DSLR value on the planet!5/14/12 UPDATE: I've now shot 100s of images, using lenses from 11 mm to 600 mm.  I've learned a lot.  Super-high resolution cameras are a new arena for most of us. On the surface, one automatically thinks you will get images twice as sharp (12MP to 24MP) as before. Wrong.  When you enter the hi-res camera stratosphere, photographic technique & lens choice are critical. While these high MP cameras are capable of amazing results, you have to work to get absolutely ALL the MP's this camera has to offer.  Do not blame the camera if your initial results are less dramatically sharper than your old 6-8-12MP Nikon. It's probably you...Set-up a table with clean background and a few artifacts on it.  Use the sharpest lens you have,  at f 8, on a sturdy tripod, perpendicular to the table, Shoot the scene with the in-camera flash on both old & new camera bodies. You will see the difference easily when images from both cameras are compared side by side, enlarged to 100% on your PC monitor.How does this translate to everyday casual shooting?  Not easily. Sub-par technique still results in sub-par images no matter what camera is used.  If you are a beginner looking for the best entry-level DSLR ever made, all of this won't matter -- grab a D3200 and shoot away!  Just note that the D3200 is capable of world-class imagery.  If it takes more effort to take photographs of this caliber, it's a good thing -- the D3200 forces you to up your game to get there!""
"20120505","5.0","Excellent camera","The D3200 is full of features and appears to be built with exceptional attention to detail. I've only used it for about 3-4 hours, but so far, I have found no issues with either the photography features or the video features. With a 16 GB SD card, the viewfinder says I can record 20 minutes of 1080P video, which seems reasonable. I also was able to take high-res pictures while recording a video simultaneously.So far, this is a top notch camera, especially considering the price point! I highly recommend this camera for anyone looking to get a solid, not over-the-top, dSLR camera.""
"20120505","5.0","Nikon D3200 hits it out of the park!","I was sceptical about the need for 24mp and what an entry level camera could do.  I went to Hunts in Melrose MA and I took two shots with my 40mm 1x macro and 1 x distant on three bodies, the D40x, the D3200 and the D5100.The D40x was crushed by both the other two cameras.  The colour saturation on both the D5100 and the d3200 were on par but the D3200's resolution even blew the D5100 away!!I got a good deal on the trade in of my D40x and I am now the happy owner of a D3200 and I'm blown away with the image quality!  I'm not sure what Nikon was thinging but this enty level dslr beats the 5100 on resolution which make me think it might also have better resolution than the D7000!!I'm happy with mine and my advice to anyone interested is to test the various cameras and judge for yourself. If you want more bells and whistles and less resolution go with the D5100, however if you are like me and want the best image quality then go with the D3200.""
"20120503","5.0","5100 VS 3200: Good Job Nikon! (ACR7.1 & LR 4.1 support RAW)","*** Update 6/12/2012 ***After analyzing the result more, I found that, for this kind of camera, my Sharp lens at the sharpest aperture is required to get real amazing sharp picture to the pixel. My Tamron 17-50 VC F2.8 at F5.6 is required for edge to edge sharpness.Also, Tokina 11-16 F.8 (which is manual focus with this camera), becomes more critical. Using the range finder mode is a must to get a tack sharp picture. That's new to me. But I am glad I learn the lesson. And now I am more happy with this camera (and lenses)...*** Update 05/31/2012***Update lightroom 4.1 today, now support NEF. And as expected despite the high resolution (24mp) cmos chips, the noise quality of D3200 is comparable with D5200.Meaning that D3200 has advantage of having more real estate (meaning more room for cropping),hence still have the same IQ with D3200. And thanks to Expeed 3 (which is the processor they use in D800 and D4 and D3200), D3200 is a very responsive camera. Bravo Nikon!************************Just received this Camera today, and this is my preliminary Review (will update progresively).Background: I have upgraded my Nikon Digital D100->D200->D90->D5100->D3200.Okay, seemed I downgrade every single time, but actually not. (I also use D300, D3X, but those are different class of equipment). This path, is more for daily activity platform (lightweight).D90 -> D5100: I actually considered to buy D7000, but chose D5100 simply because the price, and the articulated LCD because I use it 50% for Video. I am glad I did! D5100 image quality is SUPERB and on par with D7000. D5100 is lot FASTER than D3000 & D3100, but a little bit slower than D7000. From D90 to D5100, it has lots of improvement in image quality, low noise in low light, much better video (with 20 minutes max per session). The only drawback I can see, is the battery coverage is not long enough (on Video mode), but it is understandable, and the solution is add another spare.D5100 -> D3200:Other than the obvious layout design difference, the only thing I eager to know is the Low Light Noise!So I am glad to report that IT IS COMPARABLE!See my attached photo (The Costco Connection image) and judge yourself (both image are taken with the same setting at ISO 6400)So, 3200 is a clear winner!*** Update ***I upload an image taken at ISO 12800 (Hi1). For me the image is very usable.Will update the review in a couple of days, once I get the whole importance difference between 5100 & 3200 ...*** Update After 200 shots ***1. My copy of 3200 has slightly over exposure consistently (but not much, probably 1/3 ev, but I actually like slightly under exposed)2. I noticed  a slight improvement of Dynamic range. I take a shoot at an overcast day, but surprise how it can capture the clouds, the trees and shadows3. An improvement in response. It is slightly faster than 5100, but not in the same level as D7000.4. Smoother Mirror, and quieter. It is noticable (but not sure if this is consistent between model, or just batch/production variance).*** Update in Video ***The Video is also amazing. It is comparable to D5100, especially the color rendetion is great!The low light performance is on par with D5100.The addition of 720p 60fps, and the Manual Audio Level control + Stereo Audio Meter is a real plus for Video Maker, making this DSLR a good choice for Serious Video taker. I wish it has a headphone Jack, but probably too much to ask for considering the price level. The focus tracking in Video mode is also improved, not substantially but good enough to be considered. I did 4 songs video clip and really satisfied with the result. Both the end result and the operational experience are great. I use the 720p 60fps mode for this project, and really like the result.I noticed slightly longer battery time, but not sure whether this is consistent or only slight production/batch variance. (*** Update: I finally found that It is a batch variance, because the other battery I have give me noticable longer running time ***).The additional Audio Meter view (press Info several time in the live view mode), is a really good addition for me, especially while attaching external Mic for Video mode (see my image). Also the option to set the Audio Level (Mic Input) is very useful. I took 10 Video clips already, and use the Mic Input to capture the Audio from A Mixer. The audio quality is SUPERB!For all the test, I didnt use the kit lens, but use Tamron 17-50 F2.8 VC.""
"20120503","5.0","NIKON D3200","After much trying and failing to get this camera, I finally lucked out and did from a seller here on amazon. The camera is scarce right now especially the red model. I have the pleasure of getting the black model and all my other slr's are black so why break the mold as they say...First the camera looks very similar to the Nikon d3100 with a improvements to the sensors of course at 24.3 megapixel. The details and contrasts of the pictures taken are deep and rich and very beautiful on they eyes. The lcd screen on seems to be improved, much more clearer and in high contrast.I have the Sony A77 and this is my second Nikon joining my Nikon d5100. Since Canon has not came out with a high sensor that is affordable such as the 24.3 megapixel that the sony and Nikon now have. In no comparison the Sony a77 is much more expensive and you get what you pay for with it. However the Nikon D3200 is the way to go right now with a much lower price and takes great quality pictures that are vast and rich. I recommend this Nikon d3200 to anyone who can afford there 1st slr or a beginner in the field of digital slr cameras.""
