"20120611","5.0","Excellent all-purpose starter camera backpack","I've tried many different styles of camera cases over the years, and I know what I like.  Maybe it's a personality thing, but I tend to prefer the style of case that lays flat and features adjustable dividers.  Other styles like the top-loading variety tend to frustrate me more than help me when I'm on a video shoot.  And the thrifty side of me wants a well-designed, versatile case that opens up and lays all my gear out for easy picking.  The AmazonBasics camera backpack is a pretty good choice for the thrifty lenser on the go.There's three attributes that immediately jump out at me about this bag -- it feels well-constructed, it is thoughtfully and intelligently designed, and it's tiny.  Yes, it's a very small backpack.  For someone like me with -- shall we say -- ample carriage, this backpack looks like a fanny-pack on my back.  That said, it packs a lot of stuff and is a breeze to carry with me all the time.The pack zips open and lays flat, and features a good selection of velcro dividers, allowing you to customize the layout of your gear and keep it protected.  With the size of video and photo gear shrinking more and more all the time, you'll find room for your camera, memory cards, power and data cords, plus plenty of other accessories.  If you're a Flip-style camera fan, you could pack enough cameras in this bag to cover an NFL football game!  There's two zippered pouches inside that are clear mesh for easy reference of stored goods.Turning to the outside, there's a handy tripod mount on one side, pouch pockets on both sides, a couple deeper zippered pockets and a bungee corded tether on the outside to stuff even more stuff.  On the back of the pack and the shoulder straps, you'll find nice gel cushioning which makes this pack comfortable to wear.  The straps are adjustable far enough to allow someone like me to carry it, but the straps that buckle around the waist are a tad short for the pudgy shooters like myself.  I'll likely either tie these off or just outright clip them off as they do me little good.  Most of the time, I just find myself carrying it around by the handle at the top.The construction quality is great, especially for a pack under $40.  I was amazed how much I could pack into this bag, but be aware that the backpack is a little shallow if you're intending to tote longer items like a 300mm camera lens.  You may have to lay those items in sideways instead of top down.  The interior dividers are a little more 'cushy' than the sidewalls, so bare that in mind if you're toting sensitive, delicate items.  On the whole, I feel this is a bag that can take a moderate amount of abuse and keep the contents nicely shielded.  Don't go dropping it down the stairs or anything, but the occasion bump and jostle from everyday transport shouldn't be a problem.If you're an organizational freak who wants a well-made and well-designed camera bag that's just as easy to carry to a shoot as it is to carry on a hike, this may be the bag for you.  It's a great entry-level bag, or an affordable camera bag for your all-purpose social multimedia pro.  It's made for Amazon and comes in their 'frustration-free packaging,' which essentially means it comes in a plain brown box without tags, twist ties or extraneous packaging.  It's a great value and a case I feel I can count on for years to come.PROSSolid constructionThoughtful designDurable materialsCustomizable layout of contentsAmple storage for a variety of gearPadding on the back and shoulders for comfortable wearingCompact sizeAffordable price pointCONSCompact size may be too small for larger ownersWould like a couple more dividers for greater separation of itemsADDENDUM TO THIS REVIEW:  I don't think the item description mentions if it is water resistant, but I have come to find it pretty darn water resistant.  I stood out in the middle of the driving rain of a severe thunderstorm out on a pier, trying to catch lightning strikes on a bridge.  While I was mortified at the thought of my gear getting wet and ruined, I decided to stay out and keep shooting.  When I got back to my car, I zipped open the case while saying a little prayer.  Luckily for me, it kept 95% or more of the rain out, even though it was driving down directly on my back as I was wearing this backpack.  Obviously it's not 'waterproof,' but absolutely none of my gear got wet whatsoever.  I wouldn't buy it for its water resistance, but I can attest that it had enough protection to keep me high and dry in this foolhardy one-off trip of mine :)  I still wholeheartedly recommend this pack!""

I was able to get my DSLR along with 4 lenses, my speedlight and all the accessories in this and still have some room to spare.  The pack is compact and is comfortable.  The only somewhat 'tacky' thing is that the zipper pulls have the amazon logo on them which stands out on the all black exterior.  But hey, I suppose nobody will suspect that you are carrying thousands of dollars worth of equipment around in it.If you don't feel like spending a small fortune, and want a comfortable pack that does the job, I would recommend this.  I'm super happy with it!""

"20120606","5.0","Light Weight, lot of compartments, affordable prize","Received the package today and was amazed to see two card board package and good inner packing for a bag.. Thanks to Amazon for that..Regarding the product I actually went for this product after lot of research between Canon and AmazonBasics. Wanted to give a try as I just returned a Case Logic bag because of its size and weight..There are few things which I like and listing it here for future buyers1) Light weight with 2 straps one for chest and 1 to tie in waist.. Its not mandatory to use chest if it doesnt fit..2) I'm a lean person and definitely cant take lot of weight on shoulders for longer duration esp during a full day shoot.. This light weight is an awesome find for short and lean person like me3) it can hold the Tripod, and has lot of compartments inside for all the DSLR needs and has 4 straps which can be used for covering the lens and costly equipments..Hope this review is helpful..""

I also stuffed in an 7' android tablet, an ipod, chargers for the tablet and phone, extra USB cables.

"20120114","5.0","Excellent backpack","Very nice quality back pack with great padding and nice smooth zippers that dont get stuck. And again VERY nice padding front, inside and back.my only complaint is that there are too many straps there is a neck strap and abdominal strap that clicks on for more a secure feel but sometimes it just takes too long to get all that on and off, and if you dont use it, it hangs loose swinging around. But security could be a good thing since you're carrying something that expensive and not exactly shock resistant.""

"20120109","5.0","Excellent, high quality camera bag","I recently purchased a 55-300mm zoom lens for my Nikon D40, and knew that my old camera bag was going to be too small.  I read the reviews on this bag along with a few others.  I choose this bag for the amount of room inside as well as the durable looking construction.  I am glad that I did - this bag holds everything and has lots of padding and velcro-stabilized separators that keep all of my equipment in place.  I am able to bring along my video camera as well inside, as well as the zoom lens, an extra flash and flash diffuser, lens pen, the manual, and I still have extra room. I am still a DSLR novice, but there is room in this bag for whatever equipment I might need, plus anything extra I may want to carry.  Highly recommend it.""

"20120109","3.0","Ideal for D/SLR cameras WITHOUT vertical grip.","Although it holds my Nikon D2X with a 70-200mm lens attached and zips up...The bag is ideal for owners with D/SLR cameras WITHOUT vertical grip and small amounts of accessories.Pros:- No famous brand name (such as Lowepro, Tamrac, Aktiv, etc.) embroidered on the bag which is a great theft deterent - just 'Amazon' on the zippers!- Full of padding inside and also on the shoulder straps.- Easily configurable sections.- Does not feel and does not look cheaply made.- Great for carrying small equipments.Cons:- Could use a rain cover feature - perhaps if a newer model is in the works!- I feel if my bag is bumped with my D2X is inside, it might damage the top (dome part) of the camera in front of the hotshoe (I just have to be careful).- If you have several flash similar to the size of Nikon SB-800 or Canon brand, you can't store the flash(es) upright - you have to lay it flat, hence taking up more room.- Not great for carrying all equipments.Bottom line...I recommend it for photographers who are just starting out. This bag is not ideal for photographers who has all of the photographic accessories such as multiple flashes and lenses, etc.""

I even have the tripod attached with the two straps on the side. And the extra memory cards are stored safely in the zipper pouches.

"20120104","5.0","Excellent for the Photographer","This backpack is fantastic....for the avid photographer.The reason I say this is because this backpack has room for the DSLR and for quite a few lenses. You can also see that it carries a tripod, has many different pockets for even more storage. It's perfect for someone who takes pictures of natural scenery and walks a lot (for hiking and bike riding this backpack is absolutely perfect).However, if you don't plan on traveling a lot, I would suggest the Canon gadget bag. But for the price this is a great buy and the quality is legit. I just took it with me bike riding at the beach and it was comfortable and got the job done.

"20120103","5.0","AmazonBasics Backpack - An Excellent Carry-All","*Short take: Best bang for the buck.- If you are just starting out and already have a few lens and cameras to carry because you are worried that you might need the one you left at home, get this bag.- If you need a bag quickly and can;t decided on what size you really need and don't wana dish out the money for an expensive unit out of fear it may not hold everything, then get this bag.* Why:- Very low price.- Good quality materials and build.- Lots of compartments.- Good padding makes it very comfortable to carry around.- Straps make it feel very snug and secure on my back.- Lots of room to hold several lens and even two small-body cameras.- Overall low-key appearance: looks like a backpack and doesn't scream 'photography equipment inside'.* Suggested Improvements:- A little more height (2 inches or so) so once can fit a lap top (soon to be out dated technology anyway).- A little more depth (an in or so) so it can fit a Canon 1 series-sized camera standing up, attached to a telephoto lens.- The bright orange tabs be made a matching black to avoid attention.""

"20120101","4.0","Spacious, but need to be more sturdy.","Its quite spacious, comfortable to wear, but the inner walls are not so stable, that the camera keeps sagging down, and I dont remove the lens, so I guess the weight pulls it down real low.

I found my old camera bag (large ape case) held everything I needed but was inconvenient to get things out and too heavy for one shoulder.  This bag- being a backpack, distributes weight much more comfortably.  There is room for several lenses.  If you are packing a larger telephoto lens there isn't too much more room, but you can easily fit in a good size telephoto, a camera body, and maybe a couple smaller lenses into the bag.  I was under the impression that you could fit two DSLR bodies.  I can fit two into the bag, but with four small/medium lenses and two bodies it is a little snug.  I do like that it features straps for a tripod.  However, I have yet to try them out.""

"20111227","5.0","Excelent, just what I need for a good price!","Mi point of view:I bought this backpack some weeks ago and I am really satisfied by its ease of use and inner space, I used to have a Lowepro Slingshot 102, and since I have now some new things I did`t have before, was in need of more space to carry all my gear, I actually have a D7000, two YN-460II and one SB-24 Flash, A Sigma 70-300 DG, Nikkor 50mm 1.8, Nikkor 18-105 VR, Four YN radio receivers and two transmitters, 32 AA Batteries, two gel sets, and all accessory I carry around with me in the Backpack, lantern, chargers, adapters, cables, manuals, cleaning instruments, first aid things, etc, you get the idea, it all fits into the backpack and I can carry it all at once in one bag, I am happy since I had my car full of all this stuff when I had the Slingshot but now I feel more organized, and when I forget something at a location its easy to remember because its place in the backpack is empty so I immediately start looking for it.This backpack also helps me get out faster knowing that I am not leaving something behind, because everything is in the backpack.Quality:I like the zippers, the feel very professional and I can open it fast with only one hand, not having to grab it to open it, that is a big plus for me because sometimes I have my camera in one hand and need something fast, it is also very well padded in the back, I can carry this backpack for hours while shooting as I did on the mountains an it was just as good to my back and shoulders(or better) as my previous slingshot. I don't miss being able to take my camera out while carrying the backpack, I just have my camera always out and just put it in when I don't need it. Also it is well protected in case it falls, I feel sure my camera or lenses have very good protection, just as good as Lowepro.Cons:The only thing I don't like about this Backpack is its black background for the inner zippers, it is almost impossible to find my different accessories because they are almost all black, and thus indistinguishable in the black background, I think  will add a white sheet to solve this problem.I would also like to have a little pocket dedicated for memory cards, it doesn't have one, all pockets are big, so I had to put them all in a small box to keep them organized.Recommended!!""
"20111227","5.0","Doesn't fit gripped cameras well","Just got this bag today and I'm disappointed in the size.  If the bag was just a little deeper, it could fit gripped camera bodies so much easier.  I have a Canon 5d mk ii, gripped, and it barely fits in the bag.  I feel like I'm going to bust the zipper when I try to close the bag b/c it is a tiny bit too small.  If I took the grips off both of my camera bodies, this bag would fit both wonderfully.  I would only recommend this to people using non-gripped cameras.**Update**The camera bag seems to have stretched out a little and I'm able to fit gripped cameras a lot easier.  I also switched to Nikon and they fit even better than my Canons did.  I didn't think there was a noticeable size difference in the 2 brands, but apparently there is!Overall, I love this bag!

There is a plenty of storage for DSLR and 5-6 lenses or 3 lenses and other accessories. I keep a DSLR with a mounted lens, two other lenses, two speed light flashes, battery charger, batter charger for Nicad batters for flashes, ample SD cards, almost all my screen on type filters and a mono-pod if strapped to the side. No way do I carry all that stuff on a shoot but it stores everything nicely and makes it a breeze to transfer to a day pack. I have how ever used it as a day pack and the straps fell apart. The straps are also not made for full size man with broad shoulders. Amazon had my replacement to me in two days and shipped the bad one back, no big deal. If you plan on using this as a day pack expect the straps to come apart, they aren't heavy duty. If you wear larger than a Large T-shirt don't expect this bag to fit right.For what it is it's an excellent value. If the straps on this bag fall apart I will just cut them, I haven't even untied them yet on the new bag.""

"20111206","4.0","Seems OK","I just got my first DSLR and decided to try this backpack.The bag itself seems to be OK for the job but the simple fact that those zippers (all of the zippers) have the Amazon logo on them... makes me feel like an Amazon employee or something. I'm sure people will think you got the backpack from working at Amazon.Anyway... on a more serious note: I'm not sure if I'll ever travel with this backpack. It's very easy to open/close, so if you need a 'secure' backpack then you need to spend some more cash (you get what you pay for really)I'll update this review after a few months of use.""
"20111205","3.0","good but not perfect","I got the bag today. Looks exactly like what you see on the website. It is a good camera bag, but not perfect. It feels not as good as the laptop bags. The design is good, but the material is not good enough, thin and light. And forget about the waterproof, buy a rain cover if needed. Considering the $30+ price, it is acceptable. The only bad thing is the inside material, especially the adhere parts which were used to split the rooms. The material is so hard that you have to be very careful, otherwise your finger will get hurt. I don't know is it the same in the similar canon bags. Anyway, it is not the North Face bag, both the quality and price. I think its worth to have it.""
"20111201","1.0","Hate to be a hater, but this photo backpack is JUNK","As the title states, I 'hate to be a hater' and I'm certainly a fan of Amazon in several ways, but this backpack is really a piece of junk. And, sadly, I have to tell you to stay away... I don't know what other 5-star reviewers have been drinking, but anyone who's ever used a backpack specifically tailored for photography will tell you that this backpack is not even worth $20. Why so harsh?Pros:* Cheap (and that's it...really)Cons:* VERY thin padding* Poor stitching and workmanship* Ugly zippers, which will 'sweat' and get 'greasy' in the long term* Flimsy - poor internal structure means your gear will move around, a lot! Something you don't want to happen if you're looking for true protection* Pack rides very high on your back and is uncomfortable* chest strap is located too high up on the shoulder straps allowing it to 'sit' on your neck. Not good.I would certainly return this, but unfortunately I got this backpack as part of a promotion when I purchased a new camera from Amazon, and will lose the promotion price. Thus, I will 'gift it' this holiday season to my daughter to use with her every-expanding arsenal of personal electronics, since it should not be used with a DSLR that you actually want to protect.""

"20111120","3.0","Nice design, questionable quality","I bought this backpack nine months ago and immediately liked it's well-thought out design and functionality. I also own several LowePro camera bags and thought the Amazon Basics version compared favorably for about 50% less. However, there is a big difference in durability. My LowePros are nearly indestructible, whereas the Amazon Basic is already falling apart. I don't abuse my camera bags, yet the Basics bag is splitting at the seams and will eventually become unusable. Since it comes with a one-year warranty I wrote Amazon about the problem and they immediately sent out a replacement. This is one of many examples why I love Amazon and shop with them for about 90% of my online purchases: Their customer service is outstanding.Maybe my Basics bag was an exception. Despite my durability problem with the bag, I'd still recommend it for the price and its smart design.""

"20111115","4.0","AmazonBasics almost perfect SLR Camera Bag","My happiness with this purchase prompted me to write my first review.I have owned the bag for roughly a week so durability is still unknown, however at this point I don't see any pending issues.Size, I say looking for the right bag is like searching for the Holy Grail, a very subjective personal decision depending on equipment use and body size. For me this bag is perfect for walk-around, city shooting, I don't want to carry the whole shooting match. I carry a Nikon D7000 grip attached with Nikon 80-200 2.8 attached; 2 speedlites; a Tamron 28-75mm 2.8; Nikon 50mm 1.8; memory cards, fingerless gloves (when cold) and an Ipad in a neoprene sleeve. I have room for a little more but don't like carrying more than I need. I have placed a Nikon 18-200VR in it with the above mentioned and it all fit nicely.Build, looks good so far, as everyone had mentioned I could do without the labeled zippers, but a little gaffers tape took care of that.I modded my bag as soon as it arrived. It has a waste belt, I cut it and the little padded tabs off as well as the chest strap and the bungee cording on the back. Yeah I can't carry a tripod or hike mtns, but that's not what I use this bag for and don't believe you should either. If I am going in the woods there are bigger better suited bags for that. This is a city bag / shoot/ hit a coffee shop bag for me.Thats it for now, may attempt a video upload later.""

I am able to fit my Canon 5D Mark II body with 24-70L lens attached (and the bag is still long enough for a longer lens attached to the body) plus a 50mm, 85mm, and flash and still have a space left over for another lens or 2 or other accessories. The side of the bag also has straps for a small tripod. There are plenty of side pockets to fit all your memory cards and other accessories as well. I also like that the front panel of the bag has a pocket that is entire length and width of the bag so you can put a magazine, book or ipad in it with ease.The materials used look really rugged and strong. The only negative thing about this bag is that it is not lined with a waterproof material so if you need your camera bag to be water/weatherproof, this is not the bag for you. Otherwise, this is a great general use camera backpack at a great price.""

"20111104","5.0","Awesome!","There are plenty of SLR Backpacks out there.  Many of them are much higher in price than this AmazonBasics Backpack.  The backpack is extremely well put together.  There is plenty of room for a tablet, cables, filters, lenses, a flash, manuals, and even straps on the side for a tripod.  I've taken this backpack to New York, Maui, Las Vegas, and Omaha.  The straps are padded and the backpack doesn't feel too heavy even if you are carrying a bunch of equipment.  One thing I did not like is when I carry the backpack with a cutoff sleeved shirt, the material gives me a rash.  There are also too many straps on the bag in my opinion (I don't even know what they are all used for).  But those are just minor things for me.  Highly recommend.""
"20111102","2.0","Substandard workmanship","I invested $700 on my camera and lens so I was looking for an inexpensive but reasonable camera bag. I saw the Nikon bags and the Canon backpack in stores before purchasing the Amazon bag online. I am disappointed with the quality and finishing of the bag. The external material is reasonable but the internal material looks very cheap. My bag also has wrinkles in stitching which make it tilt on one side. The other bags in this price range that I saw in stores have a sturdier and more durable construction. I'll probably return this bag. Amazon could've/should've done better.""

"20111031","5.0","High Quality and Affordable.","A very high quality bag for your DSLR, lenses and accessories. I use a Crumpler Five Million Dollar Home bag for my day to day shooting - A DSLR body and a couple of lenses and accessories. But there are many times when I want to carry much more than that - 3 or 4 lenses, a battery grip, a reflector, a speedlight, cords, extra memory cards - and carry all this gear safely and comfortably.This bag is compact, with great ergonomics but cavernous in capacity. I had no problem fitting my Nikon D300S, battery grip and 35, 50, 70-300 lenses and a SB-700 speedlight. The pockets easily hold a folded reflector, ND filters, memory cards, lens caps, straps, etc. The Velcro dividers allowed easy customization of the main compartment for snug and safe storage of each piece of equipment.The padded shoulder and waist straps give a very comfortable and secure carry with 15-20 pounds of gear.This bag lacks some higher end features like a rain cover or more flexible outside storage of a tripod or attach point for other bags and pouches. But considering the price and utility of this bag, that's an acceptable compromise.Highly recommended!""

I looked around and found this one and decided, what the heck, lets see if its good. It arrived and I was impressed by the quality. No, it probably won't be better than a $180 bag but for under $35 you will not beat this deal.If you are wanting to get a camera bag and are considering this one, I highly recommend it. The quality is good, the 'feel' of the bag is nice and there is alot of padding. Stop hesitating over $35 and buy this bag. Look at all the reviews!  I'm sure they will be going up on these prices so get it while its cheap!

Also, there is still plenty of room for cards, batteries, cords, etc in the other pockets.  I will probably take my flash off and store it seperatly, though.  Now, I never leave home w/o my camera bag.  I can't fit 2 cameras in it and have what I need, too; but, for one complete setup; it's great.

This Amazon bag is pretty nice, fits my camera, 4 lens, a flash, extra batteries and all other wires as well.

The shoulder straps are also well padded, they feel good on my shoulders even after a long day of carrying it around Disneyland with my fiance.The important part is of course the inside of the bag. The compartments are able to be moved around and velcro in place, quite securely actually. The bag is very large, with room for a lot of different DSLR parts. My bag fits my fiance's D3100, 18-55mm lens, 55-200mm lens, SB-600 flash, tulip hood and wide angle lens with no problem at all. There are also a couple different compartments for holding books, or backdrops or whatever you can fit in there.

I have battery grips on my cameras and this bag isn't deep enough for them. I also like to carry 2 digital bodies and 1 film body so this bag was just a little small for me. I ended up selling this bag to a friend who carries less equipment than I do so that worked out for the both of us. I wish Amazon made a larger version of this bag because the construction was very good, the shoulder straps were nicely padded and I liked the tripod straps on the side. All in all, a great bag.""
"20110910","5.0","Super hyped on this bag","chillin bag for real, I thought it was going to be bigger and bulkier but when I first opened the box I was so happy with its size, and the room inside is perfect for all my gear, love it.""
"20110910","5.0","High Quality!","This bag is well made and can hold quite a bit of equipment. Of all the bags I looked at in stores this bag takes the cake. It is very similar to the Canon backpack bag. I chose this bag because it is simple and unnoticeable and wasn't screaming 'STEAL ME, I AM FULL OF CAMERA EQUIPMENT!'. The Canon bag has a large logo on it and is quite obvious.""
"20110908","5.0","Excellent Beginning Photographers Backpack","This is an excellent beginners backpack, it is well padded, has very comfortable shoulder straps and even thoughtfully includes a belt strap to help keep the weight balanced. Inside there is tons of room for multiple lenses, speedlite(s) and various gear. With the padding arrangement you can easily change the interior according to your equipment and needs. There is also plenty of room for filters and other materials. The outside has even more zipped pocket space and even two side velcro pocks perfect for cell phones or *gasp* cigarettes if you are a smoker. Having tried several different types of camera bags I can say for the money this is easily the *BEST* one to pick up as a beginner as it holds so much and even if you don't have the equipment to fill it now it will give you room to grow. Pick one up, you won't be sorry!""
"20110907","4.0","Cheap!  But you get what you pay for.","There are hundreds of back packs to choose from and with a HUGE price range.  I needed a back pack quick, inexpensive, and could get me through a trip to Iceland.  For those reasons I purchased this back pack.Construction quality is ok, but do not expect anything super durable.  One side of the loop handle has started to rip out of the bag, but that's because it was grabbed too quickly while on a cave tour.  Regardless, I highly recommend treating this bag with care while in use.As for storing your camera gear, the pack offers plenty of space and an ability to customize compartments to fit anything.  I carried a Canon 70-300mm telephoto lens, a 50mm prime lens, a 10-22mm ultra-wide angle lens, lens hoods, camera body, and flash in the main compartment without any trouble.  I felt the gear was protected rather well from scratching or light impacts on the bag.  Spanning from the straps again, I also was concerned and paranoid about the zippers popping open by accident while hiking.  The fix was to purchase a couple of luggage bag locks and locking the zippers together.  Probably overkill, but it was cheap insurance in my mind.Overall, I do like this bag for its price and capacity.  But, I do not see it lasting forever as I do a lot of landscape shooting and plan to carry my gear on moderate hikes for future trips.  For now I just may use the bag for storage and carrying to local destinations.  In the mean time, I will keep on looking for a new back pack that is rugged and can handle more abuse even though I may drop $100 or more.""
"20110907","5.0","great back pack","I ordered this backpack after looking around and reading reviews.  It is a great back pack and a great price.  I do alot of hiking with my camera and this works out perfectly for me.""
"20110906","5.0","awesome pack","This is fantastic camera bag.  I was looking at a lot of other big name camera bags before stumbling on this one.  For my needs, it does what I want and more for around 1/3 the price of the other bags I was looking at.  So far everything seems very well put together, but I'm pretty gentle with my things and don't throw them around too much.  Plenty of room for all my gear with room to spare.  Lots of compartments and pocketses on the bag.""
"20110905","5.0","bigger than I thought","It was bigger than I pictured from the picture on the site (and the price). That's actually a good thing since, I've heard, size is very important. I've had the bag for several months, and I carry around my Canon T2i and some lenses and a small tripod, along with some other stuff. It works very well. The first time I really used it was when my family and I went on Spring Break vacation to Oklahoma (Yes, people do sometimes vacation in Oklahoma. I was as surprised as anyone to learn this). I packed it up with my camera, and my wife's Nikon, and a bunch of lenses, and the chargers for everything, and my little pocket camera that I sometimes like to use, and some other stuff. It held everything with room for more, and it all felt well protected without being too heavy or bulky to carry around.And when I got home, I thought I unpacked it. Flash forward to a few months later, and I want to charge up my seldom-used pocket camera. I look everywhere for the charger and cannot find it anywhere. I even looked in the Amazon camera bag, but I came up empty. A couple of days later, I decided to look everywhere again. Checking the camera bag again, I opened a pocket I had forgotten was there and found the missing charger. So either somebody is messing with my head (a distinct possibility), or the camera bag has a lot of places to store stuff and then forget about.""

"20110901","5.0","SLR Backpack Review","I rarely write reviews, but I felt this was one was necessary! I bought it on a whim after seeing the video review posted on here. I currently own a Kelly Moore bag for day to day use. But when you're traveling or carrying extra equipment, having a bag strapped across your shoulder or chest is painful.I ended up LOVING it!The straps of the backpack are padded so it doesn't leave marks on your shoulder blades. The material doesn't make you itchy. Inside it's padded nicely so you don't need to worry about your equipment. It also has two extra zippers that you can use for personal things. I keep a book of choice, iPad and my medicine box in there. It also easily held my tourist maps, and misc. papers I picked up while traveling through Boston, MA. There's also two side holders, where you could put your cellphone (I rarely carry one, so I didn't test that out). I also enjoyed how easy it was to fix the straps. I'm only 5'0, so it's hard to get straps to adjust easily - however, I had no problem!To get an idea of what I carry in there: a d3100 Nikon Body usually attached with a 35mm, a Fujii Instax 210, 8 packs of film (it's big film too!), 2 lenses, my tripod (there's a side strap to be able to keep it on your bag), extra battery, Lens-Pen, extra SD card, my mother's Samsung point and shoot, and I squeeze a cardigan or my Northface parka in there.If you're a SLR user this is a must buy. The price is fantastic. The quality is durable. It held up in a New England rain storm! For the price they're selling it for you, you cannot physically get any better. When I compare this to the Lowepro backpack that I almost bought I feel so grateful for searching on here first. I can't wait to get more use of it. I'm most definitely 100% happy with this product.""
"20110830","4.0","Not Bad for the price","I wasn't expecting the greatest camera bag ever for the price but an pleasantly surprised by this.  I find that I tend to change camera bags as my needs change but this bag will probably stick around for a while. I fit my sony a200, a very nice selection of everyday lens 6 to be exact, my flash my various hoods and filters, monopod and still have plenty of room for other odds and ends. For this price am not expecting the build quality to last a lifetime but fully loaded i9t still seems solid, if it lasts a year it will be happy and feel i got my moneys worth.  Don't think that will be an issue.""
"20110830","5.0","Nice, safe storage/transport for your camera","No offense to Amazon, but I can skeptical when purchasing this product considering it was 'their brand'.

"20110828","5.0","Great backpack, Amazing Price!!","First off, great camera bag for my Nikon D7000, three lenses including an 18-200 VR.  I also house my HD Camcorder, chargers, extra batteries, remote, SD memory cards, and much more!!  More importantly, and the reason for the review is that I spent hours looking for a SLR backpack that can also house my 13' MacBook Pro.  I wasn't sure if this one could do it, but I ordered one anyways (since the price was so cheap).  I'm glad I did.  The middle pocket perfectly fits my 13' MacBook Pro!  Now I truly have an all-in-one backpack to take on my trips.  Look no further! Not only is this 1/2 the price of the more expensive backpacks, but it has more padding, more compartments and and it's way more subtle than the ones with NIKON or CANON put on blast (to prevent becoming a target for thieves).""
"20110823","3.0","Not the bag for a tall person","I read another review claiming the bag worked well for a tall person, so I ordered the bag. I am 6 foot 5 and when I put it on, with the shoulder straps sinched, the bottom of the bag was about 2/3 up my back, the waist strap just under my breast, and the sternum strap close to garroting me even when moved to the lowest position. Overall, it felt like I was wearing my two year old's backpack. On the positive side, the waist strap was long enough so that I could actually close it without a problem.Because of where the handle is attached I see why other reviewers reported that it ripped off. Not being able to use it as a backpack that could prove to be a significant problem.The bag itself is fine, with plenty of padding for equipment and extra pockets for the non-fragile items. In general it has a good amount of storage capacity with a nice selection of pockets and adjustable spaces in the padded section.""
"20110823","4.0","Packed Away","I wasn't sure of what to expect from this purchase. I compared it to several other name brand photo backpacks. I chose it because of the size and way my bodies and lens would fit in the backpack. I also wanted a plain facade so that it did not stand out to would be thieves. I was astonished to find that I can fit everything into this one backpack. It is organized and well thought out. It fits snug to the body.

"20110820","4.0","Great backpack for the money....","I was surprised with the quality of the construction and the flexibility of the layout inside the backpack to accommodate all sorts of lens sizes and equipment.  Padding seems adequate and the durability from what I can tell so far is very good.  Time will tell though as I've had this backpack for less than a months and only taken one trip outdoors with it.  Form and function are great and for the money it's a great backpack for camera equipment.  I'm hauling around a Canon 7D and 3 different lenses with batteries, iPad, extra memory cards etc...  If you have a macbook air it should fit into the sleeve no problem, my MacBook Pro 15' won't fit but I knew that before I purchased it.  The iPad with the USB converter is the best way to go for me right now. And it all fits no problem.Steve""

Love it!""
"20110801","4.0","Great backpack for the money!","I realize that I am only giving this backpack four stars. It would easily rate a five star rating overall if for one, you are a smaller individual. The material construction is top notch, the pockets and overall layout are thoughtful, and it can hold a heck of a lot of gear. I currently have packed into mine five lenses, a flash, a gripped SLR, and a spare P&S and it held all that easily. Of course, space is maxed out but on the flip-side, I have easy access to all my gear. I came from a 7 Million Dollar Home Crumpler and it held all the same gear except without the ease of access this backpack provided.The side straps I basically use to hold my iPad2 in its travel case when traveling. The combination so far has gotten me through multiple airport security checkpoints with a minimum of fuss. And this is where my gripes with the bag come in. For a 300# guy, this bag is too small to truly be comfortable. Every single one of my gripes with this bag revolves around the design too small for me to wear comfortably. The straps are too small, and it is a chore to get on and off my back at times due to the small size. Having to make the strap longer to wear comfortably means that the bag does not sit properly on my back and as such, leads to it being somewhat uncomfortable after a while. I will be taking it for a proper hike in the next month or so and will update my review to reflect any new findings (I've yet to wear the backpack while wearing standard summer fare).All in all, it is well worth every penny I spent on it. I will be jumping on a super-sized version if Amazon ever releases such though.""

"20110727","2.0","Barely adequate","This back pack bag is well made and a big step up from the little camera bag I have. I had to remove the inserts and put them back in reversed so my D-40 is at the bottom of the bag, not at the top where it would have been top heavy. The D-40 does not fit in the bag flat because of the battery grip and I'm not going to remove it to put the camera in the bag. There is was plenty of room for the 55-200 mm lens, my 3 piece macro lens set, a tulip hard hood, a soft 55mm lens hood, the Nikon remote, two spare batteries. There is room for a couple more lenses or another long lens and a flash but I'd hate to put a second DSLR in there.The straps are unnecessarily padded and bulky and I've removed the horizontal strap that connects the two arm straps. If the bag had been square at the top, there'd be more room available.I guess I should have gotten a hard case, but this bag will meet my needs for now.""

I find that adjusting the size of the compartments easy and that when adjusted they hold the lens and camera bodies snugly in place. I have not had the chance to really travel with it jet so I cannot say how it would feel on a long hike or trip but for the short trips I have taken it on I found it to be comfortable to wear.The drawback though is that it's opening is easily accessible to anyone that might be standing behind you, so if you know you will be traveling in an area that has a high pickpocket rate or theft from tourist it might not be the best bag for you.""

"20110612","5.0","THE BEST CAMERA BAG","I got this bag because I was shooting and videoing a 50th birthday party. I am an amateur photo hobbyist, whatever you want to call me.

If you can tell, this bag does wonders. It is able to reformat its interior so your cameras can stay nice and snug, as well as being packed like a pregnant woman. It is sturdy on your shoulders, but beware, the straps are not as comfortable as they seem. the straps that go horizontally as well are not that great. I wouldnt say im large, but im 5' 9 and weigh 185. my body is athletic; the chest strap is at my neck. the waist strap is good. I would say this bag is unbeatable. it protects the equipment efficiently from minor hits (i never want to hit it hard!) and it fairly weather proof, i walked the high line with a pentax 67s medium format and canon eos1v and my d80. i had my new 28mm f/2.8 and 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 as well as my 50mm f/1.4. the mist and ran only hit the exterior and protected my bag despite me not using an umbrella. if people would like to see the different ways i have packed this bag, please let me know, i have one time fit a Polaroid Sun 600, D80, Canon EOS1V, and Nikon D5000 in there with 3 different lenses.

"20110608","5.0","Value defined","This is an excellent product for the money.  I have seen some criticisms about it not being very substantial, and the like, which may be valid.  However, you are looking at more than twice this cost to get a comparable LowePro bag, so you need to be somewhat realistic.  The bag is well constructed, and easily configurable.  The padding and construction are not so robust that I would just drop it on the floor with my camera equipment in it, but I doubt any bag would pass that test.  The bag is a bit smaller than I had expected, which isn't a problem, but you should actually sketch out the dimensions if you imagine this may be an issue for you.The zippers open very easily and smoothly, which is a nice touch.  I have to agree with an earlier criticism I read that the (many) zipper pulls all have 'Amazon basics' emblazoned on them in bright lettering - I could really do without that, and it's not going to be easily removed.As a good friend once said to me, 'It is what it is.'  This is a _basic_ camera backpack, at a very attractive price point.  Given that, it's definitely a 5-star'er.""

However, with all these items, it's really full (and pretty heavy too).*It comes with several padded dividers that adhere with Velcro and let you partition the bag however you see fit.*There are plenty of pockets and it comfortably stores everything I own.*It's significantly cheaper than the Canon branded bag.Cons:*I've had this bag for about 6 months now, and normally when I carry it, I only use one shoulder strap.  I guess my bag is too heavy for this style of carrying because it's starting to fray where the bag strap attaches on top.*There are quite a few extra straps (one to go across the top part of the chest, one to go around the abdomen) and personally I feel like they look kind of tacky and get in the way.Summary:It's a great little (or not so little) bag for the money, although having the strap fray after 6 months kind of worries me.  I'll probably have to buy another bag in the near future.""
"20110527","5.0","Great little camera backpack","After reading other reviews, I was surprised by the small size of the backpack. But, once I started putting my gear in the pack, I realized it holds everything I own. It holds two camera bodies, my 400mm lens, and two smaller lenses with all the little extras. This is a great little backpack!!""
"20110526","5.0","Fully Functional Camera Bag","You might be thinking - why on earth would I need a backpack just for cameras?  Well, the serious photographer knows the answer to be sure, but as a hobbiest I didn't think that such a specialized item would come in handy.  However, after using this pack for awhile I understand its allure.First, the padded internal compartments allow me to store gear without worrying about scratches and dents.  The interior fabric is a brushed nylon and the configurable walls are padded allowing you to customize the size of the compartment you need to hold your gear.  The external loops allow you to lash a larger tripod to the outside of the bag if needed.  There are two elastic ties on the outside that you can lash gear to and an external pocket for items to grab in a flash.A feature that I also appreciate is that the bag does not scream 'camera'.  In this way people may not know what valuable equipment you might hauling around.  All in all a good bag, especially for the price.""
"20110525","5.0","Can't Beat It...","I purchased this bag to travel to Europe with (on a plane) and I couldn't be happier.  This bag is an exact replica of my friends Canon backpack, but less than half the cost.  It did have one minor issue though.  The tripod straps were never included in the package.  I called Amazon support and they gave me a partial refund for me to go out and get my own straps (they did offer to replace the bag though, I chose otherwise) and a lot better than having to ship back and forth between Amazon and I.The bag definitely has enough space for me right now though.  I have a d90 with lens attached, plus 2 other lenses in the bag, along with my flash, flash accessories, etc.  The zippered parts can hold miscellaneous small things in it (caps, batteries, etc).  There is also a second zippered compartment between the main area and front pocket that can hold my 13' macbook in it, albeit a little tight, so I wouldn't expect anything larger than a 13' laptop to fit.The ONLY thing I would want to see in this bag is a waterproof cover that slips out of it like some of the upper priced bags or have the bag made with waterproof materials.  The only part that is waterproof is the zippered compartments inside the main camera zippered part, which is a little weird imo.  With that in mind, that is why I gave the design layout a 4/5 rating.""
"20110524","5.0","Amazon Basics Backpack For DSLR cameras and Accessories","I was in the market for a new bag for my new Nikon D7000 camera, as I wanted a bit more room than my sling bag could hold. I liked the look of this bag as well as, and I have to be honest here, the great Amazon price.I was very pleasantly surprised on the fast delivery and high quality of this camera bag. My sling style bag was a fairly expensive name brand model and this Amazon 'generic' model was just as well made!!It has a good amount of storage and pockets for several lenses, my flash unit and many small items. It apparently is available in any color you want as long as you want black. I really like the place to attach my travel tripod to the side of the bag too, my other bag didn't have that.While not indicated to be able to carry a computer, my iPad fits fine in the larger front pocket (wrapped in a little extra bubble wrap, just in case!!)My only problem is that some of the straps to secure the bag in back pack mode don't quite fit me. I'm six feet tall and a big guy and the straps, even adjusted as far out as they'll go are a little short for me, tight or just not long enough. A minor inconvenience and not a deal breaker, plus my wife will be replacing the straps to lengths that will fit.Would I recommend this bag? YES!!!

It doesn't compete the high end backpacks, like the Lowe Pro, but for a smaller set of cameras and gear (one camera, a couple of lenses, and accessories), it's great.

"20110507","3.0","Get what you pay for","(1) I gave this camera backpack a try today. The size is perfect for an afternoon jaunt. For me its holds 4 lenses plus the camera. My longest lens a 100-400mm f4.0 fits nicely in a side pocket, or the center pocket with camera on. The other lenses are 24-105mm L IS, a 10-22mm, a 100mm f2.8 prime. No problems at all with more pockets to spare for the flash unit and other accessories. Has also more pockets for a rain poncho and such. The tripod straps on the right. All is excellent.(2) Construction appears very decent and good, especially for the price paid. Padding is plenty but could use 1 extra 3/4 strap to hold longer lenses in place and an outside strap (on the left) for additional equipment. The design & layout is really very good and it also depends on what you yourself make it since the dividers are removable. The durability is yet to be determined, but upon inspecting every nits and cranny it is just as good as all my other backpacks I have for long overnight treks.(3) The Huge CON is Comfort. I am 5'7' 145lbs and the pack pushes into your lower back. It feels like it's sliding down to your trousers. It Rides way too low for comfort. I tightened the straps to the point of discomfort but that didn't help one iota.That's my only beef - comfort. This pack reminds me of school kids who carry the backpack down their pants. All else is wonderful and for cost it is excellent if you don't plan on long hikes.If I had to do my purchase all over again I would have tried out camera packs in stores before buying because for me 100% excellence is more important than price.(4) I intend to use this backpack to store my long Tele lenses & to keep them safe and dust free.This pack makes an excellent storage case for your photo gear, irregardless if you intend to use it physically or not. I deducted 2 stars because the comfort lags besides that this pack is a steal.""

I looked at the bag and viewed the pics online and figured for the price I would try it out.When I received my bag it was exactly how it was online.  There are a ton of compartments and you can interchange as they all attach with velcro.  The bag is very very light and works well with my tripod on the side.  Durability, well it's fully padded but maybe could be just a tad better.

"20110430","5.0","Well worth the money!","This is a well made bag and for the price I don't think you will find a better one. I really only have two complaints about this bag but they are not big deals. I have a Canon 60D with the grip which makes for a rather tall rig. I wish the bag was about two inches deeper so the zipper would be just above the camera when it is setting in it, if you do not have a grip then it will fit perfect. The other complaint is the way the straps ride my body, not sure why it doesn't feel right when I wear it but it doesn't. It's something with the way the shoulder straps are designed it. Other than those nit-pick'ins I love the bag....I have yet to see anything... especially for the price that can touch it!..

Mind you, this is not the Lowepro construction and it is not comfortable enough to even be a day hiker, but if you need a secure place to store ALL your equipment, this is your bag. If you already have a nice sling, holster, or mid-size SLR bag, this is your bag. If the bag is going to do some light travelling, this is your bag.

There was plenty of room in the main compartment for all of my camera supplies and two lenses. I also had room to spare in the front pocket for a hydration bladder and snacks. In the front pocket I carried sunscreen, socks, baseball cap and trail maps. With the waist and chest straps the heavy load was bearable. My back did not hurt and I was comfortable the entire hike.

Overall I'm very pleased with the backpack but there are a couple of warnings. The top strap is not long enough to go over the handle of your roller luggage handle. Worse yet, after only 10 days of use the strap began to come apart from the body of the bag. The bungie straps on the back are useless because they are too weak to even hold a book. The little velcro fastened small pockets on the side are also non-functional because things fall out--so don't use them for anything.On the plus side, it holds everything I need to put in it. The compartments are perfect. Padding is adequate. I love that it does NOT have the name of a camera on it and it looks like it might be holding books instead of my $3000 camera.

Some photo packs are big, bulky, and heavy. One of the reasons I bought this bag, other than the price, was that it looked smaller. I'm 5'4' and about 125 lbs. The bag is not overwhelming for my frame.I was concerned my camera may not fit because I have a battery/vertical grip on my Canon 60D which adds some height. This causes it to not fit in a lot of bags, so I go sans grip, which is sucky. Well even though the camera w/grip is a little taller than the height of the inside of the pack, the zipper does not struggle to close. I can't believe what a steal this thing was.

"20110403","5.0","Great for a carry on! Fits perfectly under a seat on each plane I was on.","For my Mini Euro trip to London, Paris, and Amsterdam, I needed something solid that could carry all my gear(Canon 50mm f/1.8, 18-55mm and 55-250mm kit lens, Rokinon 8mm f/3.5 Fisheye, Canon T2i, couple memory cards, 5 batteries, Alienware M11X, power cords and chargers, cell phone, lens cleaners, sunglasses, iPhone, maps, at least one travel book(Frommer's), two water bottles, and a couple bags just in case of rain. Well let me tell you, this bag held all of these items and help up great over a two week period! I wasn't sure on the size when I first ordered it. I wanted a bag that would fit conveniently under the seat while on my plane rides and something that wouldn't be so big to knock people over while I'm snapping pictures. This thing is the perfect size! It fit perfectly, held everything, held up to being thrown around and loaded to the rim with stuff. I had no issues whatsoever. For the price, you CANNOT go wrong with this bag! It even rained on me a bit, a sprinkling for a couple hours of walking, but water never entered the bag! I still carried plastic bags just in case, but if you're stuck without them, you don't necessary have to worry too much. Padding was sufficient. Plenty of room to add more if needed, which I did not.Highly recommend this bag. I would rate this as a 'Best Bang For Your Buck' type item. If you're wondering whether it will hold a laptop the answer is yes, up to a certain point. My advice would be to not go over anything larger than a 13 inch Macbook(circa 2006). It fits my Alienware M11X perfectly. There is just barely enough room for the Macbook. Also be careful sitting it down when your laptop is in the front pocket. No protection does leave it a bit vulnerable. This thing exceeded my expectations and couldn't have asked for more. If you're looking for something that isn't flashy and doesn't scream,'steal me!', this is it.""
"20110402","5.0","I love this camera bag","I'm glad I went with the Amazon Basics camera bag over one of the other brands Amazon has available. I've been using this bag for several months now, and I love it. I've carried quite a few backpacks over the years, and this is by far the most comfortable. The padding is easy on the back and shoulders, and it does a good job of protecting my cameras and gear.The interior is spacious. The padding that protects the cameras and lenses inside is adjustable, so I can make everything snug and less likely to be jostled around with movement and bumps. I can carry nearly everything I need for outdoor photo-shoots with this bag.My one and only complaint is that the straps on the outside for carrying a tripod felt a bit small to me. I've worked around that problem by carrying a monopod instead of a tripod, though I didn't make the change because of the bag. Carrying a tripod for an extended period of time is cumbersome--on or off of the bag--and tends to get a bit taxing when I've got a lot of walking to do, and a monopod changed that for me.This bag is comfortable, spacious, plenty protective, quite affordable, and durable for the time that I have had it so far. This is an excellent piece of gear. You won't go wrong with this bag. I highly recommend it.""

"20110324","5.0","Kudos, Amazon","I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this bag.  I previously had a Lowepro that my business partner bought me, which is a nice bag, but for me it was overly bulky and only had space for one body with a couple of lenses.  Not to mention, it was heavy, before you put anything in it.  When we obtained our second bodies and I ended up with yet another lens, I started looking for a bag in which I could get ALL of my camera equipment - that is very important to me, even if I don't plan on using my second body (it's for backup purposes), I want it all together where I know where everything is.In my bag I have the two Nikon bodies, one with 18-105mm lens attached, and, if I can remember everything, the following: 3 more lenses, flash (unfolded), extra TTL cord, chargers for both cameras and a AA charger, extra batteries (4 camera, 20 AA), extra SD cards, cleaning kit, roll of Velcro, camera to computer cable x2, and probably more.  On the outside, on what I assume is meant for the tripod, I have my bracket with TTL cord and flash diffuser dome.I have not noticed any problems with quality at this point, like some other reviewers have mentioned.  I am hoping what happened to them was just a fluke.  Also unlike some other reviewers, I am able to wear this backpack just fine - I am NOT a small girl, either.  I admit it, I'm overweight, but the backpack is not tight at all.I love that the backpack keeps a smaller size yet has good padding for my equipment.  My only thing is it likes to fall over if you try to stand it up but I'll bet that's caused by my bracket hanging on the outside.  It's not a big deal to lean it or lay it down flat.Of course, if I have problems I will come back and update my review but so far so good, I couldn't be happier.  Even if this bag fell apart in a couple of years, I'd probably figure I wore it out and I would get another one of the same.""

The only improvement I would suggest is more extras storage, and maybe more storage or tie-ons for things such as a jacket.Overall though, for the average person going out for a hike with camera gear, this is a great pack for money, a very good value when compared to the name brand bags of similar size.

Just to give you an idea, I put my nikon d3000 + 4 lenses, a fish-eye adapter, all the little accessories and filters, my mp3 player, huge skullcandy headset, my phone, and in the second pocket I can fit my Macbook 13 inch that has a Speck case. (Yes, it's a very snug fit, but on emergency situations where I can't really travel with too many bags it's a great option to have) oh and the magsafe and adapters for the mac, AND my kindle!. The construction is very well made, and far from not liking the Amazon tags, I love them, it looks like a regular backpack so it doesn't attract as much attention as a Canon or Nikon bag, and I've used it for other purposes as well. All in all, it's my fave bag at the moment.The support belts are comfortable, but I guess on a bigger person (I'm 5'4) or larger person they could not fit.

There's just room to spare for a couple more things.The only things I have problems with are that the tripod loops are on the side, which overbalances the backpack when you carry a tripod. They'd be better on the bottom. Also, the front pocket doesn't open far enough to really see what's inside and rummage around.

"20110202","5.0","Great bag cheap!","This bag was exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for a well padded, comfortable bag with plenty of room. The bag has several large pockets, two convenient side pockets (that's where I keep my film so it's accessible), 2 large outer zipper pockets with mesh pockets inside (for filters or whatever).I can easily fit my two film SLR bodies (Minolta SRT-102 and XD-11), 2 flashes, 4 lenses (50mm, 24mm, 28mm, 70-210), several 55mm filters, a tripod, several rolls of film, and I still have room for 3 more lenses or another body (although those 4 are all I could ever need to take somewhere).The other big thing I like about this bag is unless you have a tripod strapped to it, it isn't obvious what's in it. Having a bag with a big Canon or Nikon logo (as others have said) is an invitation to steal it because the contents are definitely going to be a camera.I don't really know what else I can possibly say about this bag.

"20110127","5.0","Awesome, cheap camera case","This thing is pretty versatile, and quite a bit cheaper than anything else out there, but don't think it's subpar because of the price.  The build is nice, and can probably hold up to some pretty good wear and tear (I can't speak to the weatherproofing).  The internal compartments are roomy, and the entire padded area is configurable, so you can detach the inserts (they're velcro) and move them around to fit your equipment.  There's plenty of padding for your fragile items, and everything is held securely when the bag is closed.""
"20110124","4.0","Excellent carry-all with some quality issues","I've used this bag for about two months. Basically, I like it pretty well. The interior is padded just about right, and there are lots of little compartments (which can be customized) that hold my camera, a few lenses and other assorted gizmos. The zippers work very smoothly, and it's very easy to pop my camera in and out whenever I need it.But one of the straps has now started to come apart at the seam where it connects with the bag. I've filled the bag with gear, but certainly not overstuffed it. So it's disappointing that the manufacturing quality isn't what it should be. However, for the price I still think this is a decent choice.""
"20110124","4.0","Pretty good.  For the price, really great","It could be better in some areas, but it really is a steal for the price. Pros with expensive glass may want to spend more on one with more padding and stiffer outer shell.""
"20110119","3.0","Perfect Size, Not so good quallity","I looked all around to find a light weight backpack for my Nikon camera systems, and this one made for Amazon is the one with the perfect size for me. I can easily pack my whole system with some room for extra room for more small items. What in the backpack now are:1) D7000 body plus battery charger; 2) Nikon 80-200/f2.8AFS; 3) Nikon 17-35/f2.8AFS; 4) Nikon 28-70/f2.8AFS; 5) Nikon 60/f2.8D micro; 6) Nikon SB-28 flash; 7) Sekonik L-508 light meter; 8) Cokin P-size filter ring, mount and shade; 9) Gradual neutral density filters for Cokin P; 10) Nikon circular polarizer (77 mm); 11) Remote control, lens paper, flash accessories, etc.I cannot fit the original metal lens shades in the bag so I bought a rubber one. However, if you do not need to pack all these lenses, you can fit the original shades with two lenses. You can mount any above lenses on the camera and fit in the backpack ready to shoot.I am extremely happy with the size, perfect for me. However, the construct of the backpack is not so good. The side and bottom paddings are too thin, no good for the heavy weigh of the pro lenses. There is no problem that the bag will hold them. But you have to be really careful that no impact happens to the bag with camera equipment. When you put you camera bag down, you have to be very careful and slow otherwise you will feel and hear the impact of your lens hitting the hard floor.When I received mine, there was an hold in one of the center dividers.I am disappointed at the quality and construct of the backpack. A little more improvement could make it the best value for the price. Beside the padding, I wish the depth of the backpack could be 0.5 to 1 in more.The backpack is OK for casual photographers but not good for pro quality lenses.""

"20110114","4.0","Very Good Day Pack","PurposeBefore you purchase a pack for your camera gear, you have to decide WHY you want the pack. If you want to hike into the boonies for an overnight camera shoot, this is NOT the pack for you. It is too small. This pack has no room for overnight gear.If you want to carry all possible gear to be able to photograph anything that comes down the trail, this may not be the pack for you. It is too small. Consider wheeled photo case for this type of job.If you want a pack to carry your camera body, a couple of extra lenses, maybe a flash and a few other assorted must-have goodies, keep reading. You may have found your pack. I consider this pack to be an ideal size. On most trails, I only need a wide-angle lens for the scenics, a telephoto lens (and maybe a tele-extender) for wildlife, and a macro lens. This all fits into the pack nicely, along with a sandwich, trail mix, a 16-oz coffee container, and wind/rain jacket. Taking any more than this is not only overkill for the mission, but it is also heavy. Again, this pack is an ideal size for a day hike.Potential Pack ProblemsI have worn out a lot of packs in the last few years. Sometimes the pack material has worn out. This pack SEEMS as if the material is strong enough and protected enough that this should not happen. One frequent problem with packs is that the zippers are not heavy-duty. Although a zipper will occasionally give you warning that failure is imminent, having a sudden breakage five miles into a trail is just not fun. The zippers on this pack seem to be of good quality. However, there is no weather strip covering the zipper. Rain could seep in, although I haven't had the pack out in the rain yet.Another problem I have had with packs in the past is that the straps will tear off where they are attached to the pack. It is difficult for me to tell how well constructed this portion of the pack is. Only time will resolve this issue. While a broken strap could be a tragedy in the field, I have never seen a strap break suddenly. The rips in the strap extend slowly, giving the user plenty of time to replace the pack. Padding for the This pack's padding for the camera and other gear appears to be as good as any camera pack I have used. The padding between the pack and the wearer is also good.I have had several side-release (Fastex) buckles break in my life, but that is never a mission killer. Besides, the buckles are the only part of a pack (that I am aware of) that is user replaceable if they break. The buckles on this pack all seem to be of standard grade plastic and should not cause undue problems.The Big Problem and SolutionAll buckles on this pack are set up to be easily adjustable by simply pulling the strap or pulling up on the quick-release end of the buckle. Well, they are all set up that way EXCEPT the buckles on the waist strap. For some inexplicable reason (at least to me), this pack is set up with an extra triglide adjuster on the right side of the waist strap that makes it impossible to easily adjust the length of the waist strap. If you look at the pictures at the top of the main page, the triglide adjusters are the plastic pieces found to the left and right of the buckle on the picture showing the waist belt.When the triglide adjuster is attached to the right strap (the side with the male part of the buckle attached), the strap cannot be pulled tight, nor can the quick-release mechanism on the male side of the buckle operate to release the tightness. Changing the length of the strap is possible, but it is very cumbersome.I took the triglide adjuster completely off of the right strap on my pack and the straps now work as expected. [Note: the strap was also not properly wound around the male side of the buckle when I took to triglide off. The picture at the top of the main page shows the proper way to assemble the strap around the buckle.] I suggest you do the same.SuggestionOther than removal of the unnecessary triglide adjuster, the other change I would like to see in future versions of this pack is the addition of some kind of weather protection. A pack poncho attached to the top of the pack in a zippered retainer pocket would be a good way to keep weather off of expensive camera equipment during a hike in questionable weather, which is usually a great time to get some awesome pictures.  But carrying a small poncho or even a garbage bag would accomplish the same thing, albeit much less elegantly.ConclusionsI expect any pack to last no less than two years, but I always hope to get five years out of one before it wears out. I fully expect this pack to measure up to my expectations.I like this pack. It fits me. Because of its size, I cannot carry a lot of unnecessary (and heavy) gear, but it will carry enough gear for a single day hike. If I need more equipment, I carry it in my large, wheeled camera case and leave the case in the vehicle, carrying in the pack only what I need for the shoot.Pros:  1. Excellent size for day hike.  2. Comfortable  3. Good camera padding  4. Handle on the top  5. Zippers appear to be heavy-dutyCons:  1. The 'belt strap' can't by tightened on the fly (but read text for a work-around of what I consider a major design flaw)  2. I have doubts about the ability of the camera compartment to protect the gear from rain: (a) non-protected zippers; (b) no inner lining for the main camera compartment; and (c)no built-in poncho.  3. There is a piece of stretchable fabric on the chest strap that seems to be a bit fragile.""
"20110113","5.0","A Great Inexpensive Camera Bag","I needed a bag with room for more gadgets for my new camera.  I researched and read the reviews and thought I'd try this one.  It is a Great Bag.  It has multiple pockets you can adjust with dividers.  I was able to fit my GorillaPod tripod in the bag as well as all the cleaning supplies, filters, and other items.  It also has two zippered pouches on the inside of the lid.  I can store extra batteries, SD cards and other small items you don't want to lose in those.  There are also two straps on one side which I used to strap on my larger slik tripod. I took the bag out this week after a snowfall and was caught off-guard by freezing rain.  The backpack iced up but no moister got into the bag. I don't think I'd go out in a rainstorm to take photos - if you're looking for an inexpensive camera backpack - this a very good bag (I'm a casual photographer - not a professional) it's everything I looked for or wanted.  Also I'm 5' 10' and the straps adjusted fine for me to comfortably carry around for hours.""
"20110112","3.0","Ok for the price","The bag is ok for the price and built nice. If you have heavy lenses, it best to spend the extra money for better bag so it won't bent or fall out. If you have light lenses than it is a nice bag for the price.""
"20110112","5.0","Better than the Canon Equivalent !!!","Well the only complaint for my is the straps are somewhat short. (im 6' 2' so in my case they are short) So the backpack fits me a little higher on my back that what i like. But besides that the padding is great, good quality. The fact that the bag has no logo is also awesome. My friend has the canon version of this and he turns the bag over in his car so you cant see the canon logo. (people will see canon and automatically think its a camera and might try to break it) its almost the exact same design like the canon version but in my opinion better. The tripod straps are definitely better than the ones on the canon bag, but the placement could have been under the bag rather than on the side. Not a big deal. I store both my film SLR & my digital SLR. Along with a 250mm zoom lens, and two other lens and spare rolls of film, lens hoods, and memory cards. Plenty of space and great protection.""

I use mine for a Canon D90, 200, 300 and 50mm lenses, lens filters, speed light, filters for the speed light, spare battery, remote etc. I also carry the factory manual and another D90 book in the front pockets.My only reason for giving a 4 star instead of 5 is that the zippers are fully exposes and therefore not water resistant / proof.  If there was a flap covering the zipper I'd probably give 5 stars.  The construction and internals feel a little on the cheap side, but I've taken this on a number of trips now and it shows no sign of wear and tear, so perhaps its tougher than I first thought.Compared to other similar bags, this is a great price.  I'd buy it again.Brian""

I have my camera, 4 lenses and flash in the main compartment at the back and there is still extra room. The only thing I could think of is if you wanted to fit a note book in this bag that there is no dedicated spot, but you might just get a small on in there.No complaints at all from me, this is a great value bag for the low price.""

"20101222","5.0","Great backpack for a lot of camera gear","Just purchased this backpack as a gift for my dad. We both do photography with smaller body digital SLRs and I used it for a few days on my trip over to give it to him (I live in the states and he lives in the middle east, so it's quite a long trip - I used this bag as my carry on). I found the bag to have great construction and overall just be an excellent product. The compartment closest to you is where the camera equipment goes - there are velcro sections which can be moved around and it could hold 2-3 bodies and 2-3 lenses, depending on their size.There are to more zippers on the outside of the big section (so they're farther away from your body). The next biggest one is PERFECT size for my 13' unibody MacBook Pro, but might be too small for other laptops. It would also be a great size for an iPad, netbook, or smaller laptop. This section also has a little pocket thing inside which would probably be good for keeping an iPad from moving around. This pocket is farther away from your body, which is unusual for a laptop section (and it probably wasn't designed for holding a laptop), but it fits my bag perfectly.Some reviewers were concerned about the 'amazon basics' logos on the zippers. They are noticeable, but don't bother me. If they did, they could be removed and replaced or covered in plastic coating, as another reviewer suggested. Not really an issue unless you really care about this kind of thing.As backpacks go, this one is on the smaller side. I think this is preferable for a camera bag, as it could already hold far more photography equipment that I have. Personally, as I don't have this much equipment, I don't think I'll purchase one of these bags. However, I am tempted to (and might cave) just because it holds my MacBook Pro so well and is just a quality backpack at a great price.""

The first time I used it however I found out why.  I hadn't even loaded it completely yet and picked the bag up by the carry handle on top and the handle ripped off the bag on one side.  Needless to say I wasn't very happy since there was over $2,000.00 worth of camera equipment inside that had now bounced off of a concrete floor.  I guess now I'll find out how good the padding is in the bag.  I am returning it for a replacement and hope this was a one time problem, but I will check all the straps and handles before putting my equipment in it.

"20101209","4.0","Good bag for an affordable price","Purchased this bag about a month back on Amazon.  I was initially interested in purchasing a Canon backpack ( to go with my Canon cameras) but based on user reviews & price, picked this one instead. Delivery from Amazon was on time and the packaging was perfect.  This easily packed the following equipment ( Canon Rebel XT body, Canon 70-300 IS USM lens, Canon 18-55 EF-S lens, Canon 50mm prime lens, Canon EF-430 flash, a flash diffuser and a battery charger.  There was still one more compartment free.  The nice thing about the inside of the bag is that you can easily re-arrange the velcro dividers to create compartments of your preference.  It also comes with a zippered pouch area on the inside and outside to store additional, flat items.  The overall construction looked quite good.  The only con is that the padding is not very thick.  I recently returned the 70-300mm Canon lens and bought a much more expensive 70-200 f/2.8 Canon lens which was much more heavier.  Though this fits in the bag, I'm a bit worried about the the amount of padding available to protect the lens and as a precaution, am using the small air filled plastic bags that Amazon puts into the shipping boxes for added protection.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.""

Nikon D90 camera body (no lens attached)2.  Nikon D40 camera body with Tamron 28-70 lens attached3.  Nikkor 18-200 lens (fairly large)4.  Sigma 70-300 lens (again, on the larger side)5.

Maybe a sandwich or something. Seriously, this is a great backpack, and I cannot wait until I can take it hiking on the Wasatch Mountain trails. It's well thought-out in design and it is comfortable once you have the straps adjusted. The weight seems to be distributed between my shoulders, my upper back, and my lower back. If you're still carrying around a cumbersome shoulder (gadget) bag to anywhere but your sister's wedding, you really need one of these. It's better than some similar products that cost over twice as much. Thanks Amazon!UPDATE:  I finally got the chance to take this backpack hiking, and it exceeded my expectations! It's comfy and doesn't slop around when you get into unusual physical circumstances like I was that day! Still totally satisfied. My old Canon camera bag is hiding in the closet these days.""

"20101116","4.0","Does Amazon make a good camera bag? Yes, they do!","I know Amazon SELLS great products, but I was a little skeptical purchasing a product MADE by Amazon. However, I've been pleasantly surprised.I initially purchased the bag thinking that I was going to 'fill it up' with my Nikon D300 and 4 lenses. Boy was I wrong! Not only was I able to get my camera and 4 lenses in the bag, but I was also able to fit: an iPad (+ two cases), a pair of Bose Headphones, an iPad dock, an iPhone dock, an iPad charger, an iPhone charger, 4 extra camera batteries, a nikon battery charger, plus an assortment of other cables and adapters. With all of this, there was STILL room for maybe one or two more lenses!The bag is very well padded and securely attaches to you using two straps that clip around your chest and waist. While using it for the first time, it felt so securely attached to me that I felt comfortable enough sprint a few times with it on my back. This leads to the only complaint I have about the bag. The padded dividers are held in place by velcro, but the weight of the camera and lenses (coupled with my sprinting) was enough to cause the velcro to come undone. When I eventually opened the bag, the camera and lenses had all shifted into a 'pile' in the bottom of the bag (though nothing was damaged). I realize that it was my own fault for sprinting with $3000 of camera equipment on my back, but I figure I'd warn others about what could happen. :-)""

I have a full size DSLR, a premium (i.e. larger) compact digital camera, and two camcorders all fitted inside this backpack and still have room for a few more things. The only thing I like to see improvement on is in the design of the zipper pullers. I have the need to lock the two zipper pullers together sometimes, so it would be nice if there are holes in the zipper pullers to allow a smaller padlock to go through.

The small touches definitely favour the Amazon -- the inner zip compartments [perfect size for SD cards, lens cleaning pens, small manuals, tripod quick mounts, etc.] have a flap covering the zipper, which protects your expensive glass and camera bodies.  The foam 'foundations' for the velcro-ed compartments are firmer and a bit more sturdy [and padded] in the Amazon.  As others have noted in reviews, the shoulder strap is better-padded on the Amazon, and there is a belt cinch for ease and a healthier walk when the sucker is weighed down.  Not much difference, but a slight edge to the Amazon.  Add in the price (and no 'Canon' magnet for thieves), and the Amazon comes out ahead.Make no mistake -- this thing will hold a LOT of gear.  In the Canon, I took to Paris two Nikon DSLR bodies, an 80-200 pre-DSLR 2.8 constant zoom (big!), a 50 1.4, an 85 1.8, and a 20 2.8, SB-600 flash, along with table-top tripod, large air cleaning syringe, and assorted.  Cramped, but do-able.  And I've since put the same rig in the Amazon (but without traveling).Finally -- I also have Tamrac backpacks, as well as a Crumpler 8 Million Dollar Home Case (Blue/Orange) MD0810A.  [what can I say -- I'm a bag junkie!!!].  The others were all more expensive, sometimes over a C-Note more expensive.  And NO layout is more accessible than this Canon / Amazon full-zip opening backpack.  Lay it flat on the ground, and you can grab anything/everything in moment.  No digging, no hassle.Buy this sucker.  I got it in a lightning deal, but the normal Amazon price is still a great one.And no -- I don't object to the Amazon zippers. . . . .""

"20101006","5.0","Great backpack, great price!!","After searching for a backpack style for my Sony A550 with extra accessories, I literally just stumbled across this backpack.  Didn't even realize Amazon offered a 'generic'.  The other name brand backpacks are either too big or too small for my every day use or just too expensive.  This backpack is the PERFECT size and the perfect amount of compartments.  It is the size of a normal school backpack and the padded shoulder straps make it super comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I have not had it long enough yet to know really how durable it is going to be, but so far am far beyond happy with this bag.""

"20101006","3.0","A walking billboard for Amazon marketing ....logo, logo, logo everywhere","I am a professional photographer and use backpacks for carrying wedding gear.  I had a camera bag get ruined at the last wedding, so I purchased this bag to fill in.  The price is great, the comfort is great.  It reminds me of my old 'canon' backpack, although maybe a wee-bit smaller.  I was still able to fit my D700 and my d300 with lens, a flash, a fixed lens, and assorted batteries/memory cards and flash adapter.  But it was PACKED>HOWEVER, my biggest complaint with this bag is the AMAZON logo on EVERY SINGLE ZIPPER.  So the bag 5 zippers that are viewable to all... and 2 more on the interior.  Every single one has DUAL sided (14 in all) Amazon Basic written on them in ORANGE on a black bag.  Why, why, why.  I don't want to advertise that I purchased this bag from Amazon, Amazon is a place to purchase not a prestigious logo.  This is very disappointing to me, as to me it makes the bag less desirable.  I feel like a walking billboard.  Going to try black sharpie on the zippers, but I doubt it will work, since the letters are raised.""

"20101002","4.0","Exactly what I was looking for","I bought this backpack as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. I got the response I had hoped for - 'I love this bag!' - a few weeks later. He can fit 5 lenses, 2 flashes, 1 camera body, and tons of miscellaneous camera/photography stuff in it. The padding is substantial, I don't think he's worried at all about things shifting or banging into each other. And the straps are plenty long - he's not a little guy but he doesn't have to have them extended all the way to wear it comfortably. My only objection is to the bright yellow 'Amazon' emblazoned on all of the zipper pulls, but I guess you'll get something similar with any brand. All in all a great bag and a great value for money.""
"20101001","5.0","Just what I needed","I wanted a more efficient bag for my needs: I travel 3-4 times per year, where I carry my D90 SLR, 3 or so lenses, spare batteries and media, netbook PC with cables, GPS unit for the car, and a few snacks, and maybe a book for the plane. All of this needs to fit in a carry-on friendly package for ever more crowded airplanes. I've been using another bag that cost 3x this price, and has too many separate compartments to fit some of my larger items.Browsing for a better bag I found this one, and figured for the price I couldn't go wrong to try it. The night it came home, I packed it for my next trip (even though it's a month away). Everything fits, seems well padded. Bag is comfortable fully loaded. The front cover is plenty big for my 9' eeePC, and easily could hold a 10' netbook probably even up to a 12' model. The depth of the bag is not great: any lens longer than about 3-1/2 inches is going to have to lay on it's side. No big deal, I had plenty of room for allow that.Very glad I tried it.""

"20100929","5.0","Surprising!","You'd be surprised how much you can fit in this bag. You can also tell it's going to be protected. The padding is very thick and the velcro used to secure the sections is strong. I was able to fit a Canon T2i and Sigma SD15 body with 2 lenses for each plus accessories and there were sections left over. It is completely worth the price and more! Plus it has pockets inside to carry whatever else you don't want moving around in there. Like lens cleaning towelettes or 15 rolls of 120 film. Yes, I had those in there too.""
"20100929","5.0","Great bag!","I got this for my husband who has a canon 7D and several lenses.  He loved it!  Said it had a place for everything and was super easy to take on our trip to NYC without being an obvious camera bag.""
"20100928","5.0","I like this pack!","I bought this backpack so that I could take my camera gear wherever I went. I like this pack.  I can easily fit my Canon XTi, Tamron wide angle zoom lens, 100-400mm big lens, 50mm lens, external flash, video camera and pocket point and shoot.  The moveable velcro dividers are great for when I want to keep the 100-400 on the camera for wildlife photos.  I just move the dividers around to fit the lenses.  The other pockets/pouches carry all of my camera batteries and chargers for all the cameras, memory cards, manuals and notebooks, AV/USB cords.  Unlike my other bag, I don't have to leave anything behind.  The only way they could have improved this pack is if it would have more velcro straps to secure the lens from falling out of the compartments when the bag is opened but one could easily make some or just be careful to lay it down before opening it. I am a medium framed woman and it fits very comfortably but I imagine a larger person may find it a tight squeeze.  I would definitely recommend this backpack.""
"20100918","4.0","An inexpensive camera bag that just works","The AmazonBasics backpack is a great option for those looking to carry 2 DSLR bodies and 2-3 lenses.  The dividers are movable, as they are held in place by velcro.  This allows quite a bit of flexibility.  There are plenty of small pockets inside and outside the backpack.  They are useful for storing batteries, Compact Flash Cards, etc.  Another feature are the clips on the side to hold a small tripod or monopod.It's very lightweight yet sturdy.  One suggestion for change would be to change the handles on the zippers.  I prefer an open handle on the zipper to allow for attaching the two zippers on the main pocket together with a carabiner to prevent the zippers from separating and opening up the main compartment accidentally leading to falling hardware.I used this bag with one DSLR body and 3 lenses on a trip to Yosemite.  It was very rugged and performed it's purpose well.  Nothing happened to the camera nor the lenses.  It doesn't advertise itself as a camera bag, either, which may reduce the likelihood of theft.For the money, you can't beat it's versatility and light-weight.  I was thoroughly impressed.""
"20100917","3.0",""Decent" bag for the money","Completely disappointed when it arrived on my doorstep.  I thought it would be a little bigger.  I needed it for a time sensitive trip, so I loaded some equipment in it and kept it.  It's not the worst bag I have ever owned, but it is definitely NOT a two body bag, and the padding is too thin on the outsides for a quality camera bag.  If you're shooting an entry level DSLR, this bag is fine, but I wouldn't trust it with a full framer and pricey glass for long term use.  The price makes it attractive, and it is somewhat functional, but if you're expecting to be pleasantly surprised...  You're probably going to be let down.""
"20100916","5.0","Great bag, can hold more than just a camera","This is a fantastic bag. The movable slots allow me to make the perfect space for my camera and lens's while being able to create a bigger compartment to hold other things like my DSi, kindle and various cables I use to charge these devices. It's very convenient, I take this bag everywhere with me so it also doubles as my purse. It is a very comfortable bag and I recommend it over any side strap bag if you are not used to wearing them (it really starts to put strain on your shoulder).This bag is a little unbalance if you attach a tripod to the tripod straps, but you can get used to it. Something else I also liked it that the zipper pulls on the inside have coverings when they are shut so they do not scratch anything. There is tons of space in this bag including the pockets. This is something I will be using for a while.""
"20100914","5.0","Identical to the much more expensive Canon bag!","This is the first time I've seen the 'Amazon Basics' label but this bag looked identical to the Canon backpack except it is one solid color vs the 2 colors of the Canon bag. I am extremely pleased. A friend of mine has the Canon backback and I was able to get the same thing functionally with the same quality build for about $20 less than he paid for his - and mine is a solid black which makes it look different from the rest who are running around with identical backpacks!One thing I did discover is that in the front zipper area I can even pack my 12 inch Dell tablet PC!""
"20100914","4.0","Rating will depend on the size of the wearer...great camera bag for small to average-sized people","This bag can hold LOTS of photo equipment and still not make the wearer feel like a beast of burden.  Once full, it distributes the weight evenly, unlike some shoulder strap or sling bags.  I fit a Pentax K20D with 18-55mm lens attached, Tamron 70-300mm, Tamron 28-70mm, Pentax 10-17mm Fisheye, Pentax 28-105mm lenses, Pentax AF 360 Flash unit in the interior easily, plus storing various filters, cables, extra batteries and memory cards in the front and side pockets.There are numerous interior dividers that are easily reorganized for a customized fit, details, such as side holders for a tripod, side gusseted pocket and rubberized zipper pulls that make for easy gripping and zipping.The shoulder straps are nicely padded, as is the back of the bag.  Length of straps is adjustable as is the waist belt.  My only complaint with the bag is that despite all the adjustments, it still was not as comfortable for a wearer with broader shoulders and a little more endowment in the chest...the straps seemed too close and the across the chest strap just couldn't be made less confining.  A smaller person trying it on had no such problems.Finding the perfect camera bag is a challenging task...finding that combination of carrying capacity, good weight distribution and fit for the wearer can be problematic.  This bag will be a great bag for those who:1. Want to carry all their camera gear - the capacity of this bag is one of its strengths.2. Need a comfortable bag for a lengthy trek - the backpack style and waistband will keep it in place and secure for the lengthiest hike without shoulder strain. It will not be as convenient for those who need frequent access to change out gear.3. Are small to average-sized individuals - for those who have broad shoulders, this bag may not be as comfortable.4. Finally, price - Amazon is selling a quality camera bag for considerably less than many of the major 'name' bags companies.  Bravo, Amazon.""

Most bags that handle this much gear is usually triple the price plus so I am happy with my purchase!""
"20100902","5.0","The best backpak style DSLR bag for the money!!!!","I just got this bag delivered today and I was amazed as soon as I took it out of the box.  The quality of the materials on the outside are equal to the Lowepro and Cannon bags.  The padding inside was a concern of mine but this bag has more than enough padding to protect.  There are plenty of dividers that can be configured for whatever type of gear you carry, and when the bag is zipped up nothing can roll around.  Now to the big question- how much can it hold?  I have a Nikon D5000 with a battery grip and an 18-105mm VR attached.  A 55-200mm VR, a 35mm F1.8, a SB600 flash in its pouch, a Cannon 35mm  film Rebel, a cannon 28-90mm lens, and a small Sony flash memory video camera.  That all fits inside the bag correctly without having to cram anything together.  You still will have all of the pouches inside and a 2nd zipper section to fill with cables, cards or whatever. I was at a major camera store the other day and found exactly the same layout in a major name brand bag with the same quality of materials for $70.  The Amazon Basics line are definately my first choice when I shop from now on and I will definately recommend this bag to friends.  Thanks again to Amazon for saving me money on a great product.""
"20100827","4.0","Great camera bag, one short coming","This camera bag is very similar in quality and function to the Canon 200EG but cost $10 less.  It is comfortable on your back; build quality is sturdy and holds tons of photographic gears: at least 2 bodies + a few lenses.The only problem I have with this bag is that it holds your tripod to the side rather than having it hang off the bottom of the bag.  If you carry a tripod with it, it makes one side of your bag much heavier than the other.  The imbalance can be uncomfortable at times.""
"20100826","5.0","Great bag!","This bag is great.  I've been using it for a week now, and it's perfect for what it's being used for.  I am a photographer for a university band during football season and needed a larger, comfortable bag that I can wear all day and this fit the ticket.  Perfect for walking to/through campus, around the stadium, and it holds all the gear I could hope to ever have with me.  My only complaint is the upper chest strap isn't placed very well for me (chokes my neck) but I wouldn't wear it anyway (note:  I'm a 5'6' 130 lb female).  Also, the velcro partitions on the inside seem to get kind of loose sometimes.Overall, an AWESOME bag.  Tons of space.. I can collect all my freebie loot at the games, carry a poncho, my wallet, keys, and phone, along with all my gear.  Tripod straps on the sides (which I use to fasten a sport water bottle to my bag), velcro pockets on the outside are great for lens caps and cell phone.  2 seperate zippered pockets, and waterproof pockets on this inside.Buy this!

"20100820","5.0","Great Product for its price","The back pack is a great item for its price. The waist strap allows for good balance while walking. I was able to fit all my gear in it that would not fit into my 1500 p*&^can (fill in the blanks) hard case. I am very pleased with the product. It has ample pockets to fit all kinds of accessories needed when out and about for any type of photo op. I have recommended this product to a friend the night I got it and showed it to him. He also agreed with it being a good product for its price. He also said he was going to get one. The mere fact that it came with a tripod strap with the price you pay is very nice. I looked at quite a few back packs before deciding on this one. The deciding factor for me to make the purchase was seeing the video posted in the reviews of this product. When you are done reading this review then check out the video, you will see what I saw. Purchase and enjoy you will not be disappointed.""
"20100816","4.0","Great for what you're paying for!!!","Since you'll be using this bag for your camera/gear, it won't bring back memories in grade school when you used to carry a ton of weight on your back.  I am 5' 8' tall and about 180lbs. and the straps fits me nicely with some room to wiggle.  The padding is great although I haven't really gone mountain hiking to test it.  The only thing that I dislike about this bag is that the zipper is in the back.  I would have to flip this bag around my chest when in crowds, it would just be so easy to the would be thief.""

"20100712","4.0","a nice large backpack that will hold almost everything","This backpack is the size of what I would call a 'regular' backpack, the kind you get for school or day hiking trips.  Two SLR cameras could easily fit in here.  I have used it for my netbook and point and click camera and it works great.  Also, it fits my medical equipment (CPAP) and accessories with plenty of room to spare.  The inner adjustable compartments somehow work better than the same Velcro compartments I've used in my smaller camera cases.  However, the straps are quite short, which isn't a problem if you're just using this for packing and carrying short distances, but if you want to use this for hiking or a lot of walking and plan to have this over your shoulders, it's likely it won't fit comfortably.""
"20100710","5.0","Well Made and Sturdy","The best thing about this backpack is how sturdy and compact it is. That's hugely important to me when I'm carrying around my SLR gear. It seems to be made of a very thick canvas-like material and it protects my camera very well. I've used it a number of times already and I'm pleased with how it is holding up. It seems very well-made.The other thing I like is that the compartments inside can be moved around or just removed alltogether. When I first opened the bag I was very disappointed because I didn't think the compartments could be moved. I soon discovered that they can move and can be taken out! That makes organizing much easier. Good storage, and easy access to everything.My one complaint would be that the straps seem a bit small, even when you make them as 'big' as you can. They seem small for an average sized adult. There is a handle at the top, however, so you can carry it by hand instead of putting it over your shoulders. That said, this is a very compact bag, which is PERFECT for airplane travel, or any kind of travel really. Having to lug something huge around is a massive pain. I like how compact this is and how easy it is to store the bag.""
"20100624","4.0","Sturdy & lightweight "not so mini" backpack.","Four & a half stars. A well-made and practical backpack for photographers. I agree with the comments that it could hold 2 SLR bodies and several lenses or flashes. The compartments are adjustable. You could remove all the dividers and have one big compartment. As lightweight as this backpack is, I am surprised at how sturdy it is. The front pockets could hold flatter items such as memory cards, photos, maybe a lightweight reflective material. Although it's handsome enough for a plain black backpack, it's not exactly the most chic backpack, so I'm knocking it down 1/2 star. The surface on inside and out is quality. Not the cheap fabric you find in a lot of similar packs. I am uploading a close-up of the sporty tabs and texture. The other pictures posted are true to the backpack, so take a look at those.""
"20100623","4.0","Versatile backpack for more than cameras","This camera backpack can easily hold 2 full-size DSLR cameras and a few extra lenses, or even some point & shoot cameras all in the same case.  A mini tripod will definitely fit inside, not sure about a full-size tripod since I don't own one (if they fold up you may be able to).  Whatever you want this case to be for your particular needs, it can morph into it.The main section of the backpack is configured into 9 separate compartments.  However these compartments (slightly padded BTW) are fastened with Velcro, so you can configure the interior of the backpack into anything that you would need it for.  You can even remove all the compartments if you want and use it as a regular backpack.  Inside the 'lid' are two separate see-though plastic zippered compartments as well.As far as the exterior of the backpack, each side as two Velcro-closure pockets with flaps, which measure approx. 4.5' by 4' wide.  The outside top (lid) has 2 huge zippered pockets, there is TONS of storage areas with this case/backpack.The underneath part of the backpack which would come in contact with your back is made of mesh to keep you a little cooler while hauling it around.  The straps are lightly padded and adjustable.  It was comfortable for me (I am 5' 4'), but I doubt if it would fit well for anyone over 200 lbs.As a whole, the backpack is lightly padded with a somewhat soft tricot lining. The exterior is nylon and is easily cleaned with a wet cloth.  There is a handle on top if you don't want to use carry it as a backpack, which I do, since I don't think backpacks are all that comfortable no matter how padded the straps are.""
"20100622","4.0","Interesting backpack for gadgets","Depending on what you're looking for in a backpack, this can be a very helpful addition to your trip, wedding, or whatever event you'll be carrying gadgets to!  It's got a main pocket that would fit a small lap top, and the back pocket has nine different padded compartments that can store whatever you need.  The backpack is rigid and light, so it wouldn't be cumbersome to carry at all (it's also small).  The coolest thing about this backpack is that you can pull out the individual compartments via velcro lining.  You can also adjust the compartments in order to make them the size that you want.The only drawback to this pack is the shoulder straps are extremely small, so for any adult of an average size it's going to be tough squeezing your shoulders through the straps.  The straps are adjustable, but it would still be a challenge to put this over your back (I'm 6'3' with broad shoulders, and I can barely even get through ONE strap!).This is a quality pack, though.  If you're looking for something cheap to hold your cameras, iPods, GPS units, or whatever, this pack would be a good investment.""

Most of the cons can be resolved with a trip to the local tailor or with other accessories like a Memory Card Carrying Case and Filter Carrying Case...Overall I am Very pleased with this product.Note: When I said tight squeeze... the 500/1000mm lens (with 2x converter removed) in itself is almost the length of the bag.  My camera with its kit lens (18-55mm lens mounted) needed to be shifted to one side.... after reading original post I wanted to clarify that the 500mm lens was not mounted on the camera body.""
"20120309","1.0","made for a child.","this was such an odd fitting backpack. seems like a childs size. i had my hubby try it, too, with the same conclusion. the weirdly placed front chest strap comes right across  my neck (????) . just not a comfortable pack in any way , shape, or form. didnt even try the compartments out.""
"20120305","5.0","Well made product!!!","I got this recently to hold my growing lens collection and new Canon 60D camera.  It includes ample pockets for storage inside the compartment and on the outside.  The camera and lens storage is customizable to fit your lenses alone or attached to the camera just like the more expensive 'Canon' bag.  I could fit my camera with lens attached plus a 70-300mm, a 50mm, and a wide angle with more room to add another smaller lens.  There are straps on the outside to hold your water bottle, rolled fold-up deflector or whatever you may need.  I trust this bag to keep my camera and lenses secure while they're waiting to be used.""
"20120304","5.0","Awesome Camera bag.","This bag is absolutely awesome. Tremendous value for the price. Really good quality, lots of pouches and pockets, can't say enough about this bag. I've got a lot of gear so I was looking to carry less bags and keep more than just the camera in one bag.I keep a Canon HV20 in it with tons of other gear, lighting, cords, tripod mounts, wide angle lense, batteries,etc, and still has room another camera and extra gear. Looks small at first, but fits a lot of gear. Definitely worth every penny.""
"20120304","5.0","Great Photo Bag","Exactly what I was looking for.  I had a Sling Bag by Lowepro and sold it, because I needed a bag that fits my two Nikon cameras and some extra lenses, as well as batteries, cards, etc.  This bag from Amazon is perfect for me and easier to carry on my outings. It is well build and it has moveable protective walls inside.  The price is right too.""
"20120301","5.0","Great bag for the price..even holds MacBook pro 13"","This backpack is a great bag, large enough to hold more than just your standard two glass. I am able to have 3 differents glass, 2 full size Nikon flash, extra filters, cleaning supplies and anything else I may need for a standard shoot. The compartments are fully lined for protection and even the smaller compartment fits my MacBook Pro 13 inch and is padded for protection. The side compartments hold my 1TB external drive and the Mac power cord  on the other side. Attached it holds my tripod on one side, and in the smallest front compartment is my iPad. Fully functional bag that I highly reccomend.""
"20120301","4.0","Great Bag - Lots of Space - Mild Quality Concern","This was absolutely great for me.  Got it when I was going on a Safari in Tanzania and needed something to transport all-in-one my Nikon D90 body, 300mm zoom lens, Kit lens, 50mm lens, my netbook, charging cords, coverter, extra battery, etc etc.  I had more room than I could use.  It was very comfortable to wear travelling such a far distance (32 hours of airport travel one way).I didn't give five stars because I'm not sure how durable this little bag is for the serious adventurer. Upon returning form the trip my shoulder straps were coming undone and completely fraying.  This was a good purchase to use on a one-time safari and the bag is still technically usable but if I was someone going out often and/or using as my primary bag I would be disappointed to have a bag last me only one trip (two weeks).  I had a Jansport backpack in High School that I beat and abused year after year and this never happend to the shoulder straps.The price absolutely can't be beat and I believe you get what you pay for.  I just expected this to last a little bit longer before falling apart.""
"20120226","5.0","Nice","This is an unbeatable deal on a very sturdy pack.  You kind of expect poor construction and a bag that will last a year or so in this price range.  The build quality of this bag is every bit as good as the Canon brand bag that you can find here and at Best Buy for a significantly higher price.""
"20120225","5.0","Absolutely Perfect!","I purchased this backpack (and received it) only days before making a trip which included lugging a lot of camera gear to Ireland to photograph a family wedding there. I needed very good protection, lots of storage compartments and the ability to customize the interior of the backpack to securely hold all of my photo equipment (Nikon D7000, vertical grip, two flashes, two lenses, chargers, batteries (D7000 and a pile of AAs, cables, cards and more).Critical to my requirements, I needed a backpack that would fit inside my larger carry-on with room to spare for other 'stuff' of high value that I wanted near me at all times on the plane (not for check-in baggage!).Wow! ...not only did this bag work out extremely well for room-to-spare and safe protection from shock for all of my photo gear, but, it fit inside my carry-on perfectly and allowed me to add plug converters/power adapters, and several other personal high-value items to the carry-on with adequate room for this bag to be included.Traveling by air or not, I highly recommend this back-pack for those who wish to purchase a high quality photo backpack at a very fair price. It's built very sturdy, has more then adequate storage places and the price is 'right'.""
"20120223","5.0","AmazonBasics Backpack","I bought this backpack to take the place of my little camera bag.  I have a nikon D5100 camera that i like to take with me pretty much everywhere.  I read several reviews on several different camera bags before choosing this camera backpack.  I really like the compact design of this bag.  It has many different and easy to access compartments for each of my camera accessories.  It even has a velcro spot to put your tripod on.  The only Con that i can see is it is not weatherproof, but i have not taken it out in the rain to see how wet the inside gets if any.  I love the inside compartments where you keep your camera and several lenses.  All in all, this is a GREAT backpack for your digital camera and accessories :)""
"20120222","4.0","It's good but needs more....","It's good but needs more padding.  I had my camera body, flash and three extra lenses and Sat the bag down on the ground normally, not with any harsh force, and it was standing like it looks in the display picture, and I had my 70-200 lens with filter facing downward.  I heard a quiet snap from in the bag when I set it down but thought nothing of it.  A week later I went to use that lens and noticed the filter had been cracked.  I knew it was from putting the bag down like that because I hadn't moved the bag the whole week and there were no other explanations. But the price compared to the Canon bag, and the reviews I read all made me go with this bag and i am happy with it for the most part, aside from having to store all my lenses in it differently now to prevent anymore cracks.""
"20120222","5.0","great bag!!","after looking at multiple bags for several months, i decided to go with this one. i am so very glad i did! it's very well made, well padded and tons of room!! it can hold my nikon d3000, 3 lenses, my canon point and shoot, my video camera, plus all chargers and accessories for them all. i still have plenty of room for a flash when i get around to buying one and probably a few more other things. great bag!!! i highly recommend it!""
"20120221","5.0","Best value for dollar in camera bag.","I have always used Lowepro bags and was about to spend $200 for the Lowepro Vertex 100 AW backpack.  The I stumbled upon the Amazon Basics Camera backpack.  I figured for $35 how could I go wrong, even if I hated it, I could give as a gift.Well was I pleasantly surprised when I was able to fit (2) Nikon Bodies, (3) Len's, SB-700 flash, and many, many other accessories.Everything fits nice & neat.  Each piece is snug in it's designated slot.I highly recommend this case to any semi-pro/pro potographer.Thank you Amazon for a great economical alternative.""
"20120220","5.0","Pretty good","I received this as a gift for Valentines day and I'm really happy with it. It seems to be made well, haven't really put it through the paces yet though. It nicely holds my D60 w/ battery grip attached, an 18-55mm and 55-200mm lens with an external flash and my camera harness. I will be getting an adapter to use some old pentax glass and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find a place for all of the stuff I will be adding. With the extra weight I can see the top handle coming undone like others have said but for what I'm carrying I think it'll be just fine. And I really love the zippers and their pull tabs. Why? I dunno really, they just feel nice.However, I find the front slip pocket to be a little odd, nothing really camera related that I would stick in there so it's kind of a waste of space. But other than that, I'd buy it if it wasn't given to me.""
"20120219","1.0","Nice deal but fell apart quickly","The value of this backpack is huge.  The construction and the detailing are very nice.  I easily fit my Nikon D700, 4 other lenses, flash, IPad and a ton of small items in the pack.  Regrettably the hauling loop handle on the top of the pack separated from the pack after its first real use.""
"20120219","5.0","Great Item","This is a great camera backpack.  It is large and well-made.  In fact, the backpack was too large for my purposes and I returned.  Very impressed with quality though and all the pockets for the cost.  If you need a large, backpack-style camera bag, give this one a try.""
"20120218","5.0","Great bag for the price","I've had this bag for a year and a half and it's still in amazingly solid shape.  I travel frequently and always bring my camera and equipment and haven't had any issues with it.  I love the side straps to carry my tripod, and all the additional outside pockets to easily grab extra memory cards or batteries.  I just bought my mom the same bag because I'm so pleased with it!""
"20120216","5.0","Great Bag","I own a couple lowepro camera bags, and in my opinion, this is just as nice! I love this bag. It has plenty enough space, and I can even carry my tripod on my backpack too if I get in a crunch!""

"20120212","5.0","Best bang for the buck SLR bag","It's hard to find fault with this bag.  I looked at dozens of bags costing at least 2-3 times as much.  I found all of them lacking in one way or another.  Many were just too big and bulky and others were just too small to hold my camera battery pack, 3 lenses, charger, flash, cords etc.  The other medium bags of this type were not deep enough to hold the SLR with battery pack and lens attached.  This bag is the perfect dimensions to hold my gear without having to remove the battery pack or lens, and it is a steal at under $40.00.  I don't think you can go wrong with this bag.  Plenty of room, well designed and easy to customize compartments.  I love it.""
"20120212","5.0","What A Fantastic DSLR Camera Bag","This bag rivals the canon bag that is similar to this. It will hold all of your camera gear and gives a good amount of protection to your camera and lenses.You can arrange the compartments any way you want to hold different size items. There are plenty of zippered compartment for all types of gear. It is cushioned on the back to make it very comfortable to carry. For the price you will not be unhappy with this fantastic camera bag.""
"20120212","5.0","Good starter bag.","I bought this bag for two reasons: 1) It was reasonably priced. 2) I feel better knowing it's not an obvious camera bag. If I bought a Lowpro, Kata, or any of the other easily identifiable expensive bags I would probably be jacked. For those reasons it's perfect for me. It does have it's flaws though and the biggest one is that it's small. Right now it has more than enough space for my digital camera, camcorder, DSLR, 2 Lenses, and various camera accessories. But I'm not really talking about small in space I'm talking about small in size. I feel awkward wearing it since my normal backpack is bigger. Another issue is that the zipper handle thingies (totally what they are called) keep coming off. Though this issue could be my fault.""
"20120207","5.0","LOVE IT","I love this bag.  It holds 2 of my cameras and all of the accessories.  4 lenses, 2 being large fit with no problem.  Plenty of pockets to hold chargers and any other items I would need.""
"20120206","3.0","Over-rated ... design flaw with ergonomic issues ...","This bag makes sense only if you are a small frame person going on a rigorous hiking expedition once or twice. Let me explain ... The design of the bag is way too busy with waist strap and chest strap designed to secure bag to your body. Problem is unless you are a small person, the chest strap is too short to the point of being useless.  Second, the waist strap with its padding is fairly large and cumbersome and gets in the way. Unless you are going to use it regularly for hiking purposes, it just gets in the way.  I cut off both the chest and the waist straps and now I actually like the bag little better.  I use the handle on the top of the bag a lot on my other bags and on this bag, the handle seems very flimsy and question its ability to hold up over long haul.  Hence the crack about taking this bag only once or twice for the hiking expedition.It has lots of pockets and slots internally but they are all fairly large.  I would have liked more smaller pockets to keep small items like memory cards and batteries secure and separate. There are two small pockets externally on the side with flaps secured by velcro; I would have preferred zippered pockets here.  The side strap, presumably for tripod is marginally useful for small, light tripod.  The inside lining where the velcro dividers attach is weakly constructed as the lining walls are not reinforced with additional stitching and the back/bottom of the bag does not have velcro covering.  Therefore, the dividers only attach to the side walls and not the back wall, making them less secure. Overall construction and material quality is marginal at best reflecting its low price. The appearance of the bag does not scream expensive either, potentially lowering the risk of theft and adding to the adage, hiding in plain sight.I love Amazon, just not this bag. I bought this bag because of overwhelming positive reviews. In hindsight, I would spend a little more and get one from Lowepro or Tamrac.""

I would recommend this bag to everyone needing a single camera or dual camera bag.  Has enough room for 4 extra lenses and flash.  Great choice.""
"20120128","4.0","A great, discreet bag - but too small for me.","This bag is absolutely incredible. I've been using it for about a month now and really feel comfortable storing all of my gear inside. I have 5 lenses and 1 camera body, plus a lot of accessories. The padding on the walls feels durable and like it could protect my equipment. I wouldn't feel comfortable throwing my bag around like I would with a bookbag, but I also feel fairly certain it could protect it from long days of hiking and traveling.My biggest frustration, and also my favorite part, is that my gear is very snug. It's great because I know my lenses won't get knocked around, but it's really a puzzle to get everything to fit just right. For what it's worth, I have a 5D Mark II, 17-40mm, 28-135mm, 50mm, 100mm macro, 70-200mm, a 430 Speedlight, battery grip, and a rocket air blower. I've got a few other accessories that I throw in the outer pockets. I have to lay the 100mm on it's side which takes up a lot more room. In a pinch, I've left the 70-200mm attached to save a little bit of room.The side has clips for a tripod, which I actually use to attach my lens bags, and two velcro pockets that I store a business card holder and my phone in. My gorilla pod fits in one of the outer main pockets just fine.Overall, I'm really happy with the bag, I'm just worried about my next move. When I buy a new lens or speedlight, where will I fit it? I could carry the 70-200mm externally, but that takes away the discreet factor when traveling.""
