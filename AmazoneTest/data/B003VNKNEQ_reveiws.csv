"20120610","3.0","do NOT use for videos","I've never had a problem with Transcend memory cards in the past--I've been using them for years without fault. I assumed that with a 20MB/S rate and  8GB of memory, I wouldn't have any issues recording videos with my T2i. I'm not sure if my card in particular was defective, but the card was too low-quality to capture video, even with the lowest frame rate possible.I wouldn't call this 'class 10', and I wouldn't say it shoots 20MB/S. Can it record videos? Whelp, mine can't. Can it take photos rapidly? Yes.Bottom Line: If you want to unlock the true potential of your DSLR, spend a little more for a higher quality card (it really does make a difference). If you want a reliable card that takes photos fine, by all means go ahead and buy this one.""

"20120609","4.0","Good value, with trade-offs, on Fuji x100","When I used it with my basic Canon point and shoot, as well as a Canon T2i, it was quite fast and kept up with me when shooting RAW files. However, using it on my Fuji x100 was a different experience. Canon's processors are probably more efficient than Fuji, but I found myself waiting for the buffer to complete more often when using this card on the x100. It wasn't a huge inconvenience, and for a casual day of shooting with RAW files and movies, it definitely did its job. However, when I took my camera out to my kids' field trip, I did miss a few potential shots because of the buffer. Additionally, transferring files to the computer was also quite the wait. Now, I bought a 32GB card and like most people, I bought it with the intention of making full use of its capacity. But after a morning shoot, I transferred around 4GB of files to my computer and found it quite slow, which made me rethink about using the card all the way to its limit. Perhaps I just got used to the speeds of my CompactFlash cards that I use on my 5D, but I expected a bit more of the read speed of this card.Overall, for the price, you really can't go wrong with it and it will serve the needs of most consumers with entry level cameras. But, if you own more demanding equipment or require faster write speeds, grab a UHS-1 card. If you're paying around a thousand dollars for photo gear, you may as well get the fastest card you can get. I'm going to keep this as a backup card or relegate it to my Canon cameras, but I think I'll be shopping around for a UHS-1 card for my x100.""

I would prefer premium Sandisk SDHCs, with their reputation for high-performance and high-reliability, but the realities of budget and bang-for-the-buck have repeatedly steered me to Transcend.I tested write speeds on this card, with a Transcend USB2 SD card reader (plugged directly into a PC USB port to eliminate the slowdown of an intermediate hub), writing raw blocks continuously.The card wrote continuously at about 18.5-19MB/sec (512K blocks), with performance decreasing modestly to 17.5-18MB/sec for smaller 32K blocks.  I didn't test read speeds, but with these write numbers (writing is always slower), the card should easily meet the 10MB/sec requirement for Class-10.  Indeed, at nearly 20MB/sec, the bottleneck is more likely going to be the device using the card, than the card itself.Recommended.""

After almost two seeks of struggling, now I know what went wrong. Goodbye, shoot.I'm so disappointed in Transcend. I wonder how many other one-time shoots have been ruined.""

While we were just wrapping up, I just thought of taking one last shot and then all of sudden, I got an error on my camera as `The memory card cannot be used. Card may be damaged. Insert another card`. The card is not recognizable in either camera, card reader, computer.The card is completely dead and I no longer can retrieve any of my pics I clicked :(Update:I contacted Transcend and they confirmed the product belongs to damaged lot. They confirmed the serial number belongs to the recalled product. I am sending them the card for replacement & data recovery.Update:Got a call from transcend stating they have received the product but it seems to be physically damaged as the card opens up near the sliding lock. They are not going to send any replacement or perform any data recovery due to physical damage!!!!!!! What the hell!!Just stay away from Transcend - Bad memories start here.""

Transfer rate is pretty slow even when i have it plugged into my computer compared to my class 6 and 8.Im kind of disappointed but it is inexpensive, and its 16gb! so cant really go wrong there.bottom line, if your just shooting casually it should be ok, if your a professional, or shoot alot of HD and want crisp clean reliable images, skip this and get a better one.""

"20110809","3.0","Just Not Fast Enough For 1080p","Pros: This card is great for continuous shots, and lots of them. It's also great for shooting in RAW format because of the high capacity at such a low price! Using a card reader, data transfers quickly (15-18Mbps if my memory is correct).Cons: I purchased this card with shooting 1080p video in mind. I own a Canon T3i and my current card was not cutting it. Apparently this card was not fast enough either to keep up with the video from my T3i because the buffer continuously 'ran out' and video recording was stopped automatically. It also appeared to be extremely conditional. Shooting indoors I could record for longer periods of time (around 5 mins), however... outdoors (standard mid-west 7:00 am conditions) the card performed poorly allowing a maximum recording time of 4 seconds at 1080p 30 fps.Summary: Maybe it's the Canon T3i, or maybe it's the Transcend 32GB SDHC card.

No difference, in fact in some cases the Sandisk cards are about a second faster.Here's what I did to test:Shoot 9 continuous shots (fills the buffer) with the camera set to 5fps, 14-bit RAW.As soon as the last shot completes, time how long it takes to clear the buffer (until a 9 appears in the viewfinder again indicating you can shoot 9 shots).After 5 runs apiece shooting the same subject and lighting conditions the Class 10 Transcend card and the Class 4 SanDisk card come in at exactly the same - around 11 seconds.I got this more for the storage, but if speed matters to you stick with one of the better brands like SanDisk.""

I did a bunch of online research before buying these cards and Transcend cards have a pretty good reputation for  not having glitches of lost sectors. So far not a single issue with them and good results with my photos and video. I highly recommend getting transcend class 10 cards as they are better than what you usually get at St*ples or your average consumer store, those stores usually offer class 4, maybe class 6.

I've not done any real testing between this and other cards (I have quite a few Sandisk Extreme III cards in 2, 4 and 8GB capacities), but with extensive shooting of video and photos, I have yet to find anything to complain about.  For the price, these cards are really hard to beat.  I plan to purchase more.  Do note that if you are not shooting video, or using a DSLR and require high res images shot at maximum frames per second, a class 4 or class 6 card would suffice and probably save you money.""
"20110731","5.0","Fast enough for most of us--good value for the money","This 32GB card is a terrific accessory for a digital camera.  On my DS5100 Nikon DSLR this card allows for just shy of 1000 shots on the most profligate setting: where the camera is set to create one fine JPEG and one NEF (RAW) file per shot.  On other settings the user can store thousands of images on one of these cards.  No real need to bring a laptop or hard disk along on vacation any more.  One or two of these cards will safely and reliably store all the images that practically anyone will take on vacation.While there are faster SD cards out there, most users will not need more speed than this card provides.  Certain professionals, who blast out twenty or thirty shots at a time at say, 8 frames-per-second, may benefit from a faster card.  But usually the SD card is not the limiting factor in fast-frame shooting, so most users do not need a faster card.I have been using this card in my Nikon D5100 and it has been a real pleasure to use.

I figured an SD card is an SD card is an SD card (right?) - Well, apparently not...  Not all Class 10 SDHC cards are created equal and, as a result, I've unwittingly tested 16 GB offerings from Patriot, Kingston, and Wintec.  The Wintec and Kingston were just 'okay' (and the Patriot LX went back for being slower than a 8' floppy drive!) So I decided to do some additional searching and found a bunch of positive reviews for this card from Transcend.  Arrived today and immediately went into the camera for a low-level format, and then into the AJA System Test program (Mac) and wow!  This card is honestly accessible at over 20MB/sec (both read and write), making it almost twice as fast as the Wintec (and far ahead of the Kingston).  I'll need to shoot a card-full to see how it holds up in actual usage, but right now a second Transcend is on order and I think the Kingston will be heading back to the store.  If you're looking to record video on your Canon DSLR, look closely at this card from Transcend.""

Was reviewing them on my camera at work on monday morning and eveything was fine. Went to a meeting, then came back to download the card and it told me I needed to format it. Some research showed the card had somehow corrupted in the past hour and I needed to use a recovery program to get my photos. Downloaded the one form Transcend's website but when I tried to use it the card had gone from corrupted to unreadable. More research on the problem to find out the controller had failed. Only thing that can be done is send the card to a lab to have the flash memory chip removed and read. Turns out not to be a cheap operation. I got 3 different quotes which for this size card which ranged from $260 to $1200 depending upon how bad it was. $260 was the best I could hope for and $430 was more likely. Luckily I had already downloaded my Honeymoon photos. But the photos of me climbing the Matterhorn may stay forever lost because I can't bring myself to spend that kind of money. Good thing I don't climb for the photos.So maybe my card was a rare case but I wouldn't risk it. Look elsewhere for a new SD card.""

"20110721","5.0","Amazing card for SDHC","I use this SD card for my lower end cameras, such as the Canon Rebel T2i, otherwise known as the 550D. Even though that camera supports SDXC memory cards, I didn't think I needed that much speed for this little camera, so I bought this memory card.Overall, the speed of this card is very nice. I notice that when copying files onto your computer, it can be a little slow, even with a high-end card reader, but it doesn't seem to bug me. While taking photos, This card saves it immediately. When I'm shooting RAW, I notice some lag after about three to four shots, which isn't excellent, but I don't shoot RAW all that often, so I don't mind. When shooting large JPEGs with this memory card (The camera I am using is 18 MP), I need to shoot about 30-40 pictures before it starts lagging, which is pretty nice, seeing the burst speed is only 3.7 fps on the camera I use. Also, beware that when this card starts to get full, the performance does slow down a bit, and sadly, the lag starts when this card gets to be about half full.For the videographers out there, this card works really well. This card is able to save 1080p video at 30fps with ISO all the way up at 6400 until the card is full. I find that really rare in a memory card, but it handles HD video really well. Whenever I take movies with this card, it never randomly stops recording because of lag.To sum this up, this is a nice and cheap card for the capacity and speed, and I find this card works very well. Of course, if your camera has an SD slot and you're using it for RAW photography, you will need to find a faster card, such as a Sandisk Extreme Pro SDHC card or an SDXC card, if your camera can support it. Otherwise, this is a great card for DSLRs and works great with point-and-shoot cameras as well, although for point-and-shoot cameras, this card is a bit overkill, unless you are shooting movies with it.""

"20110721","5.0","No complaints","I don't have a lot of time on this flash card, but no issues so far.  I basically opted for the 16 gig because my battery is capable of using 16 gigs before I need to switch/charge.  You really should use the smallest card possible.  This way if you lose data, or corrupt the card which from what I read WILL eventually happen to you, you will not lose a lot of data.  I am using this in a Go Pro HD helmet camera.  Basically it works and it works fine.  No complaints.""

I do take a ton of pictures and since I shoot RAW+Jpeg (Canon) I find the 32gb really handy. However I've had problems with my card. This card errored out on me right before a wedding- I went ahead and ordered the 32gb Sandisk extreme III for $30 more than this card (on amazon) as a replacement, I didn't want to take the risk. Thankfully I am such a shutterbug that the pictures lost (if unrecovered) wouldn't have caused me any problems but had it been someone's life time event- no way.I now have something to compare this to and I can say the speed between the two cards is roughly the same but I can tell the plastic on the sandisk is better quality and I have never had a problem with any of my San Disk cards over the years (8gb and 16gb) it is always the off brands that cause problems. Are your memories or someone else's worth the risk to save like 30 bucks? I really don't think so.(just to note-I format my cards every time they do into the camera. I don't delete shots off the cards from my computer or in the camera to minimize risk) I really just think if I can- I'd like to warn anyone away from these cards- they seem great at first and like a great deal- but they are cheaply made(you get what you pay for) and unreliable.""

The reader worked fine then one day I picked the card up and it came apart. The protective, plastic cover slide off like slided bread.  It was interesting seeing the inside mini board but useless at this point.  On closer inspection it appears the glue used to weld these things together had fail.  I got some super glue and tried to glue it back but the aread where you can apply glue is just too small and my efforts fail. In looking at the detail of this card I think it is not the quality you find with the name brand cards, I have never had a failure with a PNY and they are usually reasonably priced and also the Kingston -- that old saying, you get what you pay for.  I'm wondering, though, this may be a fluke as this card comes with a high user rating?  But after seeing, for myself, how flimsy these cards seem to be I would not take another chance on one. I don't feel too much of a loss as it was supposed to be for my camera and I'm glad it did not come apart in the camera, or better still, that it never worked with my camera so it was never used in the camera.

I brought this SD card on my honeymoon to mexico and luckily I had a spare 4GB card to use, though I still lost a number of photos and videos that I cannot get back.This card randomly began corrupting images and videos.  Formatting the card lets it perform ok for a short number of shots, but then it begins corrupting again.  I would check the last one taken and it would be fine.  Then if I took another picture/video the previous one would become corrupted, repeat ad infinitum.  I could not retrieve any of them either, using many different types of recovery software.  It seems that the main corruption occurs in the file header of JPGs, but will erase the majority of the file content for video MTS files.Stay away from this card if you value your data!

The panasonic one goes on forever without ever slowing down or pausing. But the Panasonic card costs about $100 more.When using it to record full 1080p HD video, I saw now difference in performance between the Transcend and the Panasonic cards.So, for the price, you'd be hard pressed to find faults with this card if you know its slight limitations.""

I use it with a P&S (Canon A3300IS) though the class 10 speed will definitely be more noticeable in DSLRs but I got the class 10 anyway so I won't have to worry about missing a shot because of slow write speed or suffer any performance hindrance when recording videos. Just a word of caution: I read that some cameras may not be able to handle memory cards with too high a speed and may even potentially damage it in some cases, but I gather it applies to mostly older models which do not have a fast enough camera processor to handle the high speed of the card or something like that.Something I've noticed about the card is when you press down lightly on the middle of it with your fingers, you could feel that it is a little soft, unlike the solid feel of both Kingston and SanDisk cards which I also own. However this does not affect or hinder the performance of this card in any way or give me cause to not recommend, it is only an observation. I have noted that after formatting the card in my A3300IS, the memory was only 15GB. Some people also have concerns about the temperature tolerance but I don't have such concerns where I live. I of course can't comment regarding it's longevity but I believe it would last me a good while yet. Ultimately, backed by a lifetime warranty with a reasonable price and good reviews, you can surely buy with ease!""

If you are taking bursts of a longer duration, you may want to get a faster card. Otherwise, imho this card is plenty capable of handling most people's burst needs.Slightly off topic, but as a sub-rating, I gave this card three stars for 'storage capacity' because it has a truly 'average' amount of capacity...as compared to other 32 GB cards. What a silly thing to rate -- two years ago, this capacity would have been thought gigantic, and two years from now, it will be small.

Makes worry of hard drive crashes or broken disks less terrifying.I can see buying more of these in the future as other film projects come our way.  They are perfectly priced for the small independent filmmaker and perfectly suited for our cameras and other equipment.""

A recent firmware upgrade, to my AirStash drive, now permits me to use SDXC cards up to 2TB capacity size; however, until the cost of 64GB and higher capacity SDHC/SDXC cards become much more reasonable, i am going to stick with these Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS32GSDHC10E, purchased through Amazon Prime, as my far more cost effective alternative, to meet my mobile on-the-go wireless storage/use requirements with my iPad/iPhone or an iPod Touch.""

"20110627","1.0","Deletes Pictures!!","I don't know if anyone else has mentioned it or if it has happened to them personally, but this memory card deletes my pictures. It's a gamble to use, because sometimes it keeps the pictures and sometimes it doesn't. For some reason, it'll be there when I take the picture, but in the same day I can go back and the pictures will just vanish (5-50 pictures at a time). It's not the camera, because I switched memory cards and it never happened again. I just need to suck it up and pay for a better one with a lot of memory. Most people complain about speed when it comes to 16 gb and up memory cards, but mine actually deletes my pictures, which is a HUGE problem.""

I've only had it a few months, when my computer would no longer recognize it.  I returned it to Transcend as an RMA, but they refused to repair or replace it, saying that I opened the memory card.  The reality is that the card isn't very robust, which is perhaps what they mean by it being opened.  I will not be purchasing any Transcend products in the future if they are unwilling to stand behind their quality.""
"20110627","1.0","Never again.","I am always working on video productions and am very careful about the gear I use.In short, I have used Transcend twice and both times the cards got corrupted. I will never EVER use them again.The first time I was capturing footage on a 60D and when we went to upload the footage nothing could read the card. We tried multiple methods of getting the footage back but all the files were too corrupted. I lost very important footage.The second time was on a Panasonic HMC-150 and when I tried to upload the footage the camera could no longer read the card. Luckily, the card was able to be read with my Dynex card reader and I was able to get the footage off. Still, I'm not going to risk using these cards.I know some people love these cards but it's all based on numbers I guess. I just got very unlucky twice.

On the ticker at the bottom left it shows that 30 minutes are left of video to shoot but I've shot maybe 25min in a day and it kept fluctuating back between 30 and other numbers, not sure what that's about but sounds like an issue with the T2i more so than the card.

While I don't plan on taking that many images without downloading, its nice to know I have that huge buffer if I need it.As far as speed goes, I haven't had the opportunity to really test it yet.  Set on RAW only, I had no issues with writing speed when shooting 8fps for short bursts (roughly 2 second bursts), so JPEG will be a no brainer.  However I have not shot bursts while recording in both RAW and JPEG, so I can't comment on that.What I can say is that I initially thought I may need to step up to an Extreme series SD card for writing speed, but as it stands now I think I'll be happy with these (I'm buying more) cards.""

The time after the buffer filled to be ready for the the next burst takes an age and tranfer to PC is slow. I shoot raw, so I need a fast card. I was confused by it being called 'Class 10'. Should be faster than 'Class 6', right? No, not necessarily. It just means that it has a 10MB/sec minimum read/write speed, which is not much.

I don't know how or why, but these Class 10 cards are slower than my old Class 4 sandisk.  I tried both cards, one after another, and at high speed shooting, both of them were noticeably slower than my old card.  Also tried using SD slot in my laptop and just copying about 150mb of pictures to the card, again old Sandisk performed much faster.I haven't done any Read speed comparison as I'm only interested in write speeds to take many pictures fast.

Transcend's website is no help, telling me to format the card.

"20110515","3.0","Bought item for my Cannon HF200 HD Camcorder.","I am not a tech geek, so I cannot comment on the speeds and performance of this flash card. However, I bought this card to work with my Cannon HF200 HD Camcorder. I read quite a few reviews but did not see this mentioned about this card, and I could not read all six hundred of them, but for the HF200 this card will not record HD video on the Camcorders two highest settings(Which is why it gets only 3 stars from me). I was mislead a little bit becuase the Camera reccomends class 6 or higher, so I thought a class 10 would handle the job. But when trying to record in the two high HD settings, the camera says that the card will not support that resolution. It works fine on the 3 lower settings and displays over 12HRS of video time in LP. So if you have a Cannon HF200 and plan on taking nothing but high end HD video, this card will probably not work for you. Anyone reading this review, can maybe suggest another card that will? I will most likely keep it as most of the video I record will be in the lower settings. HD takes a lot of memory and I do not have an HD burner. I hope this helps the people with HF200. Thanks.""

"20110515","5.0","the fastest but it will cost","I bought this memory for the new Sony cybershot DSC-TX10 which came out early May 2011. It is a high defenition camara with HD video capability. BUT...the speed of capturing any video images or pictures is limited by the memory card. Slow memory card, poor video capture. That is why I purchased this card. It is the fastest on the market as of this date and can handle HD video. It is the second largest memory capacity of 64GB which is amazing that so much can be packed in such a small space. BUT...you pay for it (I paid about 150). However, I do not regret the purchase at all because it worked very well. Though not purfect. I noticed some choppiness when the the camare had to capture a fast moving vista as I was doing when shooting video from a moving vehicle.  There was still a little choppiness, but I had it on max HD at 1080X720 which in my opinion was very acceptable. Shooting moving subjects with a still background does great. Every still image I took was HD and camera pause was less than 1 sec as the image was stored in memory. The pauses in the camera after each picture is a result of how fast the memory card can store images. My older camera took longer than a second which can be an eternity. I can say that this memory stick, though not purfect, did very well. After all it is the fastest available to date. I love technology. If you want quick response to video capture, do not get anything less than this speed. And as for the 64GB capacity, you don't need to go higher (there's a 128GB out there) as I took about 45 min of video combined with about 100 pictures, all HD, I only used about 15 percent of the memory. I always download and save my images so as to free up the camara for the next oportunity shoot. This memory card was expensive but it was needed to take full advantage of HD.""
"20110514","2.0","Won't record HD video as a Class 10 SDHC card should","I bought this supposedly Class 10 SDHC card to use with my Canon T3i during my trip to Disneyland, knowing I'd probably want to take a lot of videos, and my current 4GB card probably wouldn't cut it. I'd done enough reading to know that if I wanted to record full HD videos, I should get a Class 10 SDHC card, and this one was the first result that popped up when I searched Amazon. It had enough decent reviews and I figured it was a good choice. WRONG. When I tried to record video onto it, after a couple seconds, my camera would display the message 'Movie recording has been stopped automatically.' ...Hmm. Weird. I popped in my 4GB PNY Class 4 SD card, and it recorded as much video as I wanted, for as long as I wanted. Popped this supposed Class 10 card back in, and movie record was stopped automatically again.If you just want to take pictures, then this card will do the job. But if you buy it expecting to be able to record HD video on it as a Class 10 card should, then spend a little more money and buy one of the more reliable big-name brands.""
"20110514","5.0","Great card for the money","I purchased two of the Transcend 32GB Class 10 cards to use with my brand-new Canon HFS200 video recorder and couldn't be happier.  The cards performed flawlessly, giving me a combined total of ~4 hours of video at the highest possible resolution and frame rate; plenty of time to film my son's graduation from Marine Corps boot camp and all of the ancillary ceremonies.On a whim, I popped one of the cards into my Canon XSi DSLR.  Again at the highest resolution, the card would hold >5600 still pictures.While other reviewers may have carped a bit about the speed not being truly Class 10 SDHC material, it hasn't been a problem with my equipment.  In fact, I intend to buy a couple more to use as video camera 'extras' and for use with my DSLR still camera.EDIT 20 May 2011:  I received my two new 32GB SDHCs and field tested the speed on one in my Canon XSi.  In 'Continuous' shooting mode (where the camera will shoot ~3.6 frames per second) and the camera set to the highest resolution ('L' or 3072x2304 pixels), I took 38 photos before the camera seemed to take a short breather.  The camera slowed a bit to somewhere around 2 frames per second for 5 pictures, then picked back up to >3 frames per second for 17 more frames.  After 60 frames I ended the test.  I probably could have shot many, many more shots in 'Continuous' mode without much of an issue, but my battery was getting low...  I assume the slowing I experienced meant that the write speed couldn't quite keep up, but the camera never gave me a 'Busy' warning and completely stopped taking pictures like it would when using a Class 2, 4 or 6 card.  This card is plenty fast enough for me, since I don't plan to quit my day job and become a sports photog any time soon...""
"20110513","5.0","Good price and it works","After hearing lots of incompatibilities between different brands of cameras and SD cards, I was careful in searching for a decent (cheap and functional) SD card for my Nikon D3100 DSLR.  I was using an older Patriot 8GB SDHC class 6 card which worked fine, but I wanted larger capacity and faster speed.  The Patriot class 6 card works okay for video (both 720p and 1080p), but when I do burst shooting (3 pix/sec for D3100), I notice it does not always get me 3pps and buffer was full just after a few shots.  Even more noticeable with RAW+fine shooting option.  With this Transcend 16gb SDHC class 10, not only I get larger capacity for cheap (cheaper than most other brands), I got a speed upgrade over my older Patriot card as well.  Using Fine or Basic shooting option (no RAW), I can shoot around 6-10 pix before I notice a slowdown in writing into the SD card.  This is already a noticeable improvement for me.  The best of all is I've not lost any pictures or video with about 8gb of data I've shoot with the Transcend so far.  With so many compatibility issues out there, I can confirm this card works with my Nikon D3100 DSLR without any issues.It's no speed demon, but it work 100% for my purposes.

I already own a Patriot 16GB class 10 card which works beautifully and very consistently for me.  I bought this Transcend card based on value and reviews I read.  After having used it for a couple days I have to admit I'm disappointed.  For stills, it's fine.  For video?  Not so much.  It is constantly failing on me.  I'm also receiving a camera error when using this specific card in which I cannot shoot any video at all sometimes.  Despite formatting the card a few times, the problem persists.  This does not happen with the other cards I have from other manufacturers.  I can't say I know exactly what the problem is but I don't really care about that.  What matters is that it only happens with this card in the camera.  I bought this card so I could shoot more video with the greater storage capacity.  Needless to say, I think I'm going to just get another Patriot card at 32GB and try that while keeping this card for stills at least.  Nothing wrong with it for that.""

I would have given it an overall 5 stars, but every now and then when it gets close to full it will stop recording and say 'recording has stopped' even though it is not quite full.

To be fair: I'm shooting RAW and I'm shooting weddings and events. For someone with more standard use 20 MB/s might be okay.Even with compressed RAW and just 12-Bit it was like this: 5-6 clicks without delay then I had to wait about 3 seconds for every following click.I bought 2 SanDisk 32GB cards with 30 MB/s then (also labeled class 10 but this doesn't mean much - compare MB/s). They were about twice the price of the Transcend but it's a huge difference: 8 clicks without delay then a click every second.Again, if you're using the card in a SLR for vacation, landscape etc or video it's absolutely fine - fast enough. If you're using it for shooting events (or worse: sports) then pay more and buy something faster or you will likely miss some shots while waiting for the card to be ready again.""

It's better to have a high capacity card than a couple of less capacity cards; it beats changing cards and fearing you might run out of place too soon. This card is a class 10 so it is very fast in transferring the data in and out, remember the higher the 'Class' the better response you'll get. Remember don't be blinded by big name brands, open your eyes to effective productivity.""
"20110413","5.0","Big and Fast","I've been using SD cards for a while now (and MMC cards before that....) but when I bought my new Canon SX30IS camera last year, I knew that I'd need a big and fast SD card for it.  I chose this 16GB Transcend and have not been disappointed.  It's large, quick and has been good for me so far.  My camera takes HD video and this card keeps up just fine.  Class 10 is the way to go, and I doubt that I'd buy anything slower considering the price differences.My biggest problem is that I can let too many pictures build up on the card, so when I finally download them it takes me forever to organize them, which is no fault of the card.  :)I've used a smaller (4GB) Transcend SD card in one of my other digital cameras and it's been fine for years, so I felt good going with the same brand for my new camera.""

"20110413","5.0","Speed, size, and price - great sweet spot","I'm just starting into digital photography, and had been working with a class 4 card.  My DSLR's continuous shoot operation delayed about 2 seconds between shots with that card, owing, I assume, to its slow write speed.I got this card instead, and that delay has shrunk to somewhere between half a second and one second.  This is great, since most of the time I'm trying to capture a smile on an infant's face, and he's less than cooperative about holding poses!  The 16 GB of space doesn't hurt, either - I could shoot over a thousand raws on this card alone.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.""
"20110412","5.0","Fast, and reliable","This is a good card.  I can snap off almost 27 JPG images in burst mode without my cache filling up with this card.  It is reliable,....no corrupt issues or anything like that.  Definitely glad I bought the 16GB option as the movies taken from PEntax KR are kind of on the LARGE file side of the spectrum.Either way, its hard to go wrong with this card.""
"20110412","4.0","Works with GoPro HD camera","I purchased this memory card to use it with my new GoPro HD camera.  I was a little nervous because I've read that the GoPro cameras can be finicky about which memory cards they work with and Transcend is not among the memory card brands that are recommended by GoPro.  However, the price seemed really good for a Class 10 card of this size, so I decided to give it a try.I am happy to report that the card seems to work fine with my GoPro HD.  I've typically been recording at the 720p60 setting, which GoPro lists as having a 15 Mbit/s data rate.  I've also used it on the 960p30 setting, which is listed as having a 12 Mbit/s data rate.""
"20110412","5.0","So far so good. Awesome Price.","Bought this for my Playsport Kodak camcorder. So far everything works well and gives me over 2-3 hours of video recording at 720p 60fps setting. It hasn't failed on me yet, but the transfer speed to computer is pretty slow. However for the price you pay for this compare to other similar products, this one is definitely worth it. I will update in the future in case if it ever fails on me (highly doubt it).""
"20110412","5.0","Works great with the Wii","I bought this because we needed more storage in our Wii.  We had a 1 GB card but that was mostly filled - we've purchased a number of downloadable games and hardly had any space to download any more games or demos.Moving the content from one card to another was a minor chore: first I inserted this card into the Wii, turned on the Wii, and moved (not copied) everything from system memory to this card.  I then turned off the Wii, inserted the old SD card, turned the Wii on, and moved as much as I could from the old SD card to the Wii.  Powering down the Wii, I inserted this card again, turned on the Wii, moved everything from system memory to this card...over and over until the old SD card was empty.  Phew!Now that everything's copied the card works as expected.  We can launch directly from the card and all thumbnails show up like they should.  No problems with this card and the Wii.Note that SD cards larger than 2 GB require Wii system menu 4.0 or higher to work.  If you've been doing system updates as they come out you'll be fine (we have version 4.3 right now) but if your Wii isn't connected to the Internet you'll have to update your system manually; see Nintendo's site for instructions.As an aside, Amazon's frustration-free packaging is great.  This card was in a plastic SD card protective case, which was in a thin cardboard envelope along with instructions and warranty information.  I unzipped the envelope, recycled it, and I was ready to go.""

"20110408","2.0","Could not transfer all files successfully","On both Linux and Windows computers I had problems transferring some files to this card.  There were certain files that failed every time.  I thought that there might be a problem with the files themselves, so I tested transferring them to a SanDisk 16GB SDHC, and it worked without a problem.Many times when I tried to transfer files to the Transcend card in Windows, it would be halfway through the file transfer and then I would get a pop-up message saying that the transfer had failed, followed immediately by a notification from the operating system that a new disk had been inserted.  It was as if the card's connection to the computer would somehow drop out sporadically in the middle of the transfer.  The odd thing was that this only happened with certain files, and it happened consistently.  It seemed to have no relationship to the size of the file, since there were plenty of larger files that I was able to transfer successfully.  But as I mentioned before, the same files transferred just fine to my SanDisk card.Maybe the card I had was just an anomaly, since this product seems to have pretty good reviews overall.  Either way, I returned the card and traded it for a SandDisk card.  My first experience with Transcend left a bad taste in my mouth, and I wasn't anxious to find out whether it was coincidence or not.""

"20110408","1.0","Avoid Transcend brand for HD video with Canon DSLR !","The reason I am scoring this card is based on DSLR HD Video only -I currently use a Canon 60D that I bought in December and I bought a 16 gig class 10 Transcend card. The card has been fine for photography but I noticed I kept receiving errors when trying to shoot HD video. I assumed the problem may have been I needed a larger card. I decided to order a larger card, but upon researching and trying out the various cards I already had more I have realized that the problem is with the Transcend brand itself. For some  odd reason even if it's a class 10 (which according to Canon anything higher than class 6 will work for HD video) it crashes when shooting video. However, when using even a 4 gig class 6 SanDisk card, HD video shoots just fine. Altho the value of this card is awesome, I am disappointed that I have to return this item for a more expensive SanDisk card in order to shoot HD video.So in a nutshell if you are using a Canon DSLR with  HD video --DO NOT BUY THIS CARD, IT WILL STOP YOUR  VIDEOS WHILE RECORDING AND GIVE YOU ERROR MSGS! So far the only brand I know that is working with the Canon HD video recording is SanDisk, but those are the only two brands on hand I had to test it out.""

If I just transfer from the camera, no problem, but I like to geotag and have to edit the metadata after the fact which requires me to place the disk in my Mac and alter the files.

Honestly, this one works excellent.  I use it in my Canon S95 and it rocks!  I actually bought a second card.  In hindsight I should have just got the 32 GB model.

"20110323","5.0","SAME shooting speed as SanDisk Extreme III 30MB/sec. on Nikon D90 & D7000","This video review is misleading and a fraud. But that's only a bad thing for SanDisk as this Transcend card is literally more than 99% as fast as the most expensive SanDisk card you can buy for a Nikon D90. Hell, this video is the reason I bought the SanDisk card.In the video review where he states '...The difference is the SanDisk card can capture 100 photos at fine resolution in 24 seconds. The Transcend card captures 66 photos in the same time/resolution' he is lying. I too have a Sandisk Extreme III card, a Transcend Class 10, a Transcend Class 6 card and a Nikon D90. I repeated this frame rate test at several resolutions. At EVERY resolution, there is EXTREMELY LITTLE frame rate difference between these cards. The truth is that even Transcend Class 6 cards offer essentially the same frame rate at the same resolution as the most expensive SanDisk card you can buy. The ONLY way you can get a D90 to shoot at maximum advance rate for 100 shots (without any buffer lag) is to drop to a low resolution and AS LONG AS YOU ARE RUNNING TRANSCEND CLASS 6 OR HIGHER, YOU WILL GET THE FASTEST FRAME RATE A NIKON D90 OR D7000 CAN MUSTER.I also own a Nikon D7000 that shoots at a substantially faster maximum advance AND writes MUCH larger files. At highest resolution of RAW + Fine Large jpeg, the difference between this Transcend Class 10 card, the SanDisk Extreme III and a Transcend Class 6 card is insignificant. We're talking about approximately 0.2 frames difference in a 4-second burst at Continuous High advance. All cards burn down the buffer in less than 2 seconds and then you are in jerky buffer-restricted advance at the same rate regardless of card.Food for thought: SanDisk marketed their Extreme 30MB/second cards as BOTH Class 6 and Class 10 at different times. They are the same cards. The TRUE difference between Class 6 and Class 10 is, wait for it... MARKETING. Wonder why Transcend Class 6 cards cost about the same as their Class 10 cards? Probably because they perform the same and likely ARE the same...This and the Transcend Class 6 card get 5 stars because they are literally over 99% as fast as the SanDisk '30MB/s' cards at a fraction of the price. Do NOT waste your money on SanDisk cards. They do not improve frame rate over Transcend Class 6 or 10 cards nor do they transfer to computer any faster. I'd only give the SanDisk cards 2 stars because they perform well but are EXTREMELY overpriced.""

Recorded pics and video are great quality, no issues whatsoever.  THIS CARD IS A GREAT VALUE!""
"20110321","3.0","OK, but with reservations","I purchased the 32gb class 10 Transcend card because it received better reviews than Transcend's class 6 version, even though my camera mfr. specifies that the max speed it will support is class 6.Upon receipt, I tested the Transcend with H2TestW. Yes, it does technically qualify as class 10 because H2TestW reported a write speed of 16.3 mb/sec and a read speed of 18.2 mb/sec. However, the write speed is barely higher than a 4gb class 6 Sandisk card (15.5 mb/sec) which I also own. This tells me that what Sandisk labels as class 6 would qualify to be a class 10 card.Incidentally, Transcend does not appear to be as good a Sandisk cards in general. As a comparison:Sandisk 4gb class 6 came in at a write speed of 15.5 mb/sec and a read speed of 18.4.Transcend 4gb class 6 came in at a write speed of 11.2 mb/sec and a read speed of 14.8.My observation is that Transcend produces results only about 72% that of Sandisk for cards with the same specifications.A note on my tests: I probably have a fast card reader and other stuff on my desktop because using the same test on a notebook produced significantly lower results.""

"20110320","2.0","Barly Performs to Industry Standard - NOW DEAD!","I purchased this product on two points, Class 10 & price.Although the price is amongst the cheapest out there, if you want quality in speed, you need to look closer.Here is a break down of the industry standard 'Class' ratings:  * SDHC Class 2: 2 MB/sec (16 Mbit/sec)  * SDHC Class 4: 4 MB/sec (32 Mbit/sec)  * SDHC Class 6: 6 MB/sec (48 Mbit/sec)  * SDHC Class 10: 10 MB/sec (80 Mbit/sec)This memory card being Class 10 means it has to achieve a minimum sustained write speed of 10MB/s.  This card does just that.I ran a benchmark using ATTO Disk Benchmark [...].  I compared it to another brand card, (16GB Class 6).  Although this card does what it's rating says it is suppose to do, the 16GB card did better at a lower Class.This cards Class 10 maximum Write Speed was just over 11MB/s and Read Speed was about 15.5MB/s.In contrast, the Class 6 more expensive card I used to compare, its Write Speed achieved about 14.3MB/s and a Read Speed of about 15.8MB/s.So if you want a product that does 'just' what it's suppose to do for a cheap price, this is the card you want.  But if you can afford a little more, you can do better with a more 'name brand' card....in my opinion.Happy recording!-------EDIT EDIT EDIT-------I've been using this memory card in my Fujifilm HS20EXR.  It's performed flawlessly until just now.I've had it for just over a year now but started using it end of March 2011.  So I've only been using it for 11 months.I've taken almost 5000 pictures with it and maybe about 50 1080p videos.The card is now dead.  I was able to recover my images before it died completely, but in my opinion, this card should have lasted a few years.

The main reasons I use this one the most is because its the largest and just as fast.  While I know the Sandisk is supposed to be the fastest, I really do not notice that much of a difference.  So, if you want a great performing SDHC card and the best value per GB, consider the Transcend SDHC card!""
"20110305","5.0","Great quality for a low price! :)","Admittedly, all I've had previous to this memory card was a 2GB memory card I bought from Circuit City a few years ago when I worked there. I didn't have the need for more than that until a recent camera purchase. Regardless, this memory card is great and I'm really glad I picked this one. The low price made me a little cautious but the good reviews definitely outweigh the bad, so I went with this one. Glad I did.""
"20110304","5.0","Large and fairly fast!","Good deal for a card this size, if you look around. 16gb formats to 15gb for file system. Everything does that.  I tested this card against several others I have. Here are my results.  First I copied 3.3gb of pictures and small video files to card (13,646 files!!!), took 6min 24sec. To delete same took, 5min 44sec. So, be ready for it to take time to copy, transfer, and delete, large amounts of data. This holds about THREE DVDS and then some when full!!! It will take time!!!  Very fast in my camera, took next to no time to delete several files of both types. Happy with that.  Test against 8gb class6, 8gb class 4 and 8gb USB stick for comparison.... Transfer of the same 729mb file, about a full CD, to device and from device to computer. A 3.2ghz single core from 2004ish. Remember this is just a one file test. Remember, multi-file transfers can take time for the Hard drive to find the next file, often there are stops. THIS CARD...from computer To card=58.66 sec, From card to computer, 43.30 sec. Delete was instant. Micro sdhc 8gb class 6. from comp. to card, 1:17.43, from card to comp. 43.21 sec. Delete was instant. 8gb Kingston USB stick. From comp to stick 1:16.74, From stick to comp. 43.65 sec. Delete was instant. Micro sdhc 8gb class 4. From comp to card 2:47.03, from card to comp. 51.15. sec. Delete took 6 sec. Starting the file transfer took 7 sec for recognition.  The time on all these started when I hit COPY on the requester, and ended at 100%, the class 4 stayed on 100% for 3-4 seconds after stopping. SLOW CARD!  You can see from this test, this card is faster on transfer from comp to card, but about the same on transfer from card to comp. So, it will depend on your needs. My 8gb class 6 is very fast in the same camera. So, if you need a 16gb card this is a tad faster, but a class 6 might just do the job and for a little cheaper.  For what this card does though, I am happy with it.Shipping was excellent, a good deal all-round. 4 days cross country from NY State.Thanks to Amazon!""
"20110304","5.0","huge capacity for more ease of use","The huge size of this memory device is the highest amount the manufacturer claims the device it was bought for can handle. Less missed moments are achieved as the card does not have to be changed as often, and runs out of space less often.""
"20110304","4.0","A bit pricey, but hey.","I'm sure you could think of better things to buy with 70 bucks, right?  Well, I should have thought of that too.  With that in mind, I will say that this product is really helpful.  At the same time, I bought an 8gb Eye-Fi card.  This product allows for a feature called 'Endless Memory' which it can do provided that you are near a network.  When reading up on this, I decided that I needed a backup card that would provide me with enough memory that I wouldn't find myself changing cards all the time.  My camera has 8gb of flash memory, but I somehow thought this wasn't enough.  With the addition of the 32gb card, I was able to increase my record time from 1 hour and 2 minutes to a little over 4 hours.  So, if you record a lot, then this is definitely the product for you.""

Class 10 means that this is one of the fastest SD cards available and the price from Amazon was great.  I am using this card in my Windows 7 netbook as a ready boost drive and the netbook is noticeably snappier with it fitted.

On Large Format JPEG, it holds 3,261 pictures, on RAW it holds over 1,000.I did have an issue w/ it, but I'm not sure that it was the cards fault. I had taken like 10 pictures for my photography class, and the night before the assignment was due, I went and plugged in the camera in the lab and absolutely nothing was there. It told me to reformat, so I did, which erased everything that might have been on there. I haven't used it since, but I don't think it was necessarily the cards fault.

"20110302","3.0","Great Capacity","I researched Class 10 on the Internet and found that Transcend was rated better than most for the Canon T2i.  I needed the memory for filming the wedding of a friend.  The card memory capacity is clearly outstanding.  The filming stopped after continuous recording of about 4GB.  I don't know if it was due to the memory or the camera.  I think it was the camera, because there was no indication that the memory slowed down the recording.  I continued filming successfully a few minutes later throughout the evening.  I used only half of the card capacity without worrying about running out of memory.""
"20110302","3.0","USE WITH CANON T2I","For photos, it is great! Speed seems fine and it stores a ton!My only concern is with the HD video from my t2i. It seems that ever since I got this card, when recording video on it, my camera will sometimes stop recording automatically. Some error message pops up stating it is stopping, and then after a few seconds it lets you record again. Sometimes it does it again, sometimes it doesnt. I may be wrong in assuming, but it seems the camera may be writing at faster speeds than the card can handle. Not sure if this is the case or not, but yeah. Just something to be aware of. And who knows, maybe I got a bad card.""
"20110302","3.0","Works, but I wouldn't buy another Transcend Flash Memory Card - UPDATED","While reading the reviews prior to ordering this card, a reviewer mentioned that the Transcend seemed to be physically over sized. I thought that the reviewer must be crazy, SD cards are a standard size. Well, I guess I too am crazy.I received the Transcend card this morning and after popping out the 8GB Kingston card that I had borrowed from my camera, I inserted the Transcend into my camcorder. The card just didn't feel right going into the camcorder, so I tried to pop it out. No go! Apparently when you press on it to pop it out, it releases, but it fits so tight in the slot, that the camcoder springs are not strong enough to pop it out. I had to get my finger nail on the edge of the card and pull it out of the slot.At that time, I remembered the review that mentioned that the Transcend was over sized. I compared the Transcend to my other SD cards, a Canon and a Kingston, and I could feel that the Transcend was a bit wider. Not happy.I figured since there is no reason why I would be popping the card in and out of the camcorder, I would keep it if it worked.So, for the last few hours I have formatted, recorded, copied and deleted, and the card seems to work fine with my camcorder.The fact that the card is over sized does not give me that warm fuzzy feeling that I would like to have. If Transcend can't size the card properly, what other problems are there, that are not so obvious?If I encounter any further problems, I'll update this review.I'll hang onto the card, but I will not purchase another Transcend item.UPDATE: February 10,2012.Well, I have to eat my words.I bought another Transcend memory card. This time a 32G card. Based the purchase on price and the fact that the ill fitting 16G card has worked flawlessly.I purchased the 32G card to be used with the same camcorder that the 16G card was being used with, thus I have been swapping the 2 cards.The new, 32G, card could be inserted and ejected from the camcorder, without binding, from day one, and after a few iterations of the 16G card being inserted and ejected, it no longer sticks.So, both cards work well and neither binds/sticks when being inserted and ejected.""

But because I also shoot video, I needed much more space and ended up choosing this card. It is defenately not as fast as my other class 6 cards but for the most part it can keep up with 1080 resolution video. The reason I say for the most part is: it has caused my camera to stop recording on several occasions when the buffer fills up and the memory card cant keep up (generally under high contrasty and colorful scenes where more data needs to be written). But other than that, I have also filled up 8gb straight of video without problem.This card does what I needed it to, be able to allow me to shoot uninterupted HD video and for cheap.If I needed a fast card for shooting continous pictures of more than 15 frames or in raw mode I would look elsewhere.""

I'm glad I tested it prior to leaving as it did not work in my camera, or at leas not as advertised.  The camera simply displayed a message stating that I couldn't record in FXP mode (HD) with the current SD card (even though the technical details for the product state 'Perfect for vast amounts of HD video and high-resolution images'.  In fact I had to bump the resolution down 2 levels before the camcorder would allow me to record.  According to the documentation that came with my camcorder, it is capable of writing HD content to an SD card with a Class 4 speed rating.  So, while this card is advertised as a Class 10, I don't believe it actually is.  In addition to the problems using this card in my camcorder, the card also could not be read by the card reader in my PC with Windows 7.  I had to plug it into the card reader on my printer before my computer would recognize it.I returned the Transcend SD card and purchased a slightly more expensive 32GB Kensington SD card, and everything works as it should, in my camcorder, and in my PC.""

I can definitely see a significant performance improvement using the new Class 10 memory, especially when recording full HD movie @30fps (frames per second) as well as taking large-sized fine quality (JPG) pictures @ the rated 3.7 fps.  Taking rapid-fire pictures using the Class 10 memory is an experience by itself (it feels like having a mini-machine gun in your hand, one can certainly co-relate the rapid clicking:-)). Never once, it had stopped during recording movie and pictures. It is blazing fast.As far as the rated capacity of 16GB, it truly is 16GB.

I almost always have a spare with me, but I didn't bring one with me this trip.  I was able to recover a few photos, and still had my iPhone as a backup, so nothing to cry over.My biggest gripe is when I sent my card back to Transcend for a replacement, it seems the Postal Service snatched my card!  I didn't get insurance or certify it (big mistake on my part I realize).  Lots of information I could post here, but the short story: I called Transcend and although the guy I talked to believed my story, there was nothing he could do without the physical media in his possession.  He offered me a bad discount of like 10% which is still more expensive than Amazon's price.  I'm not broke, and I don't really care that I had to spend $50 to buy another one.  (Yes, I STILL purchased ANOTHER Transcend 16GB card after this).  I am just a little disappointed at Transcend's customer service.I realize my experience probably isn't typical.  Failures happen and unloading your media off your card is important in case of failure.  I'm very happy I didn't really lose any data, but I'm disappointed with how Transcend handled the situation and really mad at the USPS for stealing my failed memory card.I give the card 4 stars, minus a star for one failing, minus another star for sub-par CS.  If this memory card doesn't fail on me after a while, I will give it another star or two, but Transcend must win me back first.""

Would have bought more if the price was lower. I think it's a little overpriced. I paid 50 dollars for a 32GB class 10, and 30 for a 16GB. Ouch.""
"20110203","4.0","Fast, reliable, large capacity, good value overall","Giving the insignificant price difference between a Transcend Class 6 vs. a Class 10 at the time of purchase I decided to splurge and pay the extra 2 dollars even though the little camcorder I'm using the card with claims that a Class 6 should be good enough for it.I ordered this item for 2 reasons:- At less than one dollar per GB, it's not a bad deal at all at the time I'm writing this but be aware that SDHC prices are in a free fall.- Transcend appears to make reliable SDHC cards and I've been happy with a previous Transcend SDHC (class 2) card purchase.FEATURES AND USABILITYThe included SDHC card, is sufficiently large to hold a large collections of pictures for a digital photo frame but this one is built for speed. 'Class 10' guarantees transfer speeds of at least 80 Mbit/s - or 10 Megabytes per second - which is about 66x in CD-ROM speed rating equivalent. This is not the highest class rating for SD cards but it's fast enough for most digital camcorders. In fact, most (like mine) are quite happy with the lower speed 'Class 6'. On a mostly still frame camera that accepts SDHC this should be a speed monster.It's worth noting that the card came formatted as FAT32. This is what most cameras would like to see but some Microsoft operating systems may not allow you to reformat and some older cameras may not be able to recognize anything over 4GB. My Windows 7 laptop could read the card through an included USB adapter. As for formatting it, there are public domain formatting utilities out there that would allow you to do it under XP, Vista or Windows 7 if your camera has trouble reformatting it.PACKAGING, CONTENTS AND WARRANTYIt was not easy to take the card and the adapter out of the near-bullet-proof plastic enclosure but a pair of powerful scissors did the job, eventually but not without cutting some of the included paperwork.Besides the card, there is a very generic, credit-card size 'manual' that comes with the usual warnings - don't touch the connectors, don't bend the card and so on.The lifetime warranty statement on the card (whose lifetime?) will have Transcend replace or repair your item if you still have your receipt and you don't do anything from a long list of activities and nothing  that's on a long list of possible happenings happens to the card (don't chew on it). In other words, it's meaningless.Finally, there's a card inside the package that promises 'free software' in the form of a 'photo recovery' tool from Transcend's site. It would install on the card itself if you go to the site with the card plugged in and have it download directly into the card. If it installs successfully, you should be able to recover some deleted photos and even photos lost because the card was formatted by mistake. I chose not to download the tool because I'd have no use for it but it's good that it's there.MY RATINGI like this card for its price, the card's relatively large capacity (32GB are also available) and for its speed. I do not appreciate the largely meaningless 'lifetime warranty' claims used to market the product but I don't care much about warranties on items for which the cost of shipping them to the vendor may come close or exceed the cost of buying a new one.Since the product does very much what I expect it to do, a 4-star rating - means 'I like it' - is fair.""

Because this 32GB size is getting very popular be sure that the equipment you intend to use it in is capable of handling 32GB of memory.

"20110126","3.0","Good for photos, not for videos","The 8GB SDHC card works perfectly with my Canon T2i, and it captures and transfers pictures quickly. It has plenty enough memory for all the pictures I take (1000+ per occasion and other random shots). It also comes at a really great price.However, my one complaint is that it cannot capture long videos; even though it's a class 10, I have trouble recording on HD with my Canon Rebel T2i because the camera will automatically stop recording video (likely because there are errors with the SD card in transfer speed and such). The most it will record for ranges from a few seconds to a few minutes. I would definitely recommend you get a brand name SD card if you plan on using it for recording HD videos. Otherwise, with photos (even in RAW format), it works perfectly fine.""

I would highly recommend this card and bought it because I have had consistently good results with Transcend cards and this card isn't any different.""
"20110121","2.0","The best for professionals, with a price to go with it.","To be perfectly honest, I would never have bought this prior to using it on a review loan from Transcend. I own many Transcend cards in multiple formats and sizes (mostly 32gb) and all perform beautifully; about one bad image per seven thousand: one SDHC for my Sony NEX-3; which shouldn't be underestimated as a profesional level camera, one CF and one SDHC card for my Canon 1Ds III; full frame and BIG for when I'm doing a fancy shoot that doesn't require too much mobility, one SDHC for a portable boot disk (should I not have my laptop and need my workspace on a computer), and one SDHC used with a USB reader as a flash drive (with a few other 8gb, 4gb, and 2gb cards). I got this card as a review unit from Transcend before they released it, and recently bought one myself at a discount from them only for when I go on long trips without my computer. I'm a freelance professional photographer, so in the usual day I'll be doing anything from a product shoot to college sports to a fashion show. Basically, all the small and medium businesses that can't payroll a full time photographer hire ones like me, usually on a regular basis. So I certainly keep myself busy and can rack up thousands of pictures in a day. Before I continue with the full review, I will mention that I used this primarily with my NEX-3, and for about an hour underwater SCUBA in my girlfriend's Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS2. My Canon 1Ds III doesn't support SDXC (sadly).Capacity: Massive! PRO.This card is massive beyond all others. 64gb is 4000 14MP RAW pictures. That's absolutely top of the line capacity. 4000 pictures is even above and beyond what I use in three or four large shoots. Usually I use JPEG, which is about a third to a fifth the size of a RAW image. On my NEX-3, it reported 10,250 14MP Fine JPEG pictures, double that (20,500) in 7.1MP Fine JPEG, and double THAT (41,000) in 3.5MP Fine JPEG. All of these are truly ridiculous. But that was for a full APS-C sensor camera at highest possible quality. When I put it in the DMC-TS2 for the first time, I thought it couldn't read the card and freaked, since the 'pictures left' indicator just kept flashing. I put it back into the NEX-3 and it was fine. So I figured I'd take a couple shots with the TS2 with the card in and see what happened. Lo and behold, it saved the pictures just fine. I put it into full high speed mode with a specially rigged remote to just hold the shutter button down, and came back about 20 minutes later to see if it showed a number. Eventually it hit 9,999 after it took 2,568 pictures. So this is a card that owns the market on capacity for SD cards.Speed: Not so fast, CON.This card starts to fall down when it comes to speed. It gets the Class 10 speeds just fine, but not much more than that. For those that don't know, Class 10 means that no matter what happens to the card short of being completely physically destroyed, it will have at least 10 Megabytes per second sustained write speed. I maxed out the card at burst speeds of around 15MBps, but that's it. It will handle HD video perfectly fine, but it won't write fast enough to use the magical 7fps continuous speed mode on my NEX-3 to the full advantage. It went for 20 JPEG shots at 7fps before slowing down to 2.3fps. It went for only 9 RAW shots at 7fps before going down to 2fps. This is both fault on the only medium sized image buffer, but mostly on the card. My Sandisk Extreme III card can keep up at around 5.5fps on RAW or JPEG continuous speed mode. This isn't a card to buy for the highest speeds, for that get a Sandisk Extreme card. I, II, or III doesn't matter, all are more than acceptable.Reliability: Among the best, PRO.This is never a big problem on any big brand memory such as Lexar, Sandisk, Patriot, Kingston, or Transcend. As far as I'm concerned, as long as it's less than one bad image in a thousand I'm fine with the card. I've never ever had a bad image on a Sandisk card, but I haven't used them enough to really tell. I've used them for ~10,000 shots, and none were bad. On Lexar, Toshiba, PNY, A-Data, and Kingston (who's SD cards are all the same) I get about one bad image per two thousand. So not too bad. Patriot does a little better, with one per three thousand. And finally Transcend, which gets one bad per 7000. So image corruption is never something to really worry about, and it's usually the camera that writes bad, not the card. On older or off brand point and shoots I get about one bad per hundred shots.Value: Absolute worst, CON.Definitely the worst point on this card. Before another story, I'll spare you: don't buy this card unless you really, really need to or really, really want to. I cringe every time I think about how much I spent on this card. I bought it for use on a week long European backpacking trip with my girlfriend, and neither of us brought our computers, so I needed the card capacity because of that, and I have to say that it served me well for the trip. Did I need it at all? No. Would I have been smarter and better off using a couple 32gb cards? Absolutely. But the peace of mind that came with knowing I couldn't fill it was nice. I did in fact send it back afterwards and bought another 32gb card and a battery each for my 1Ds III and NEX-3. Much better purchase for the money.Compatibility: Not too bad, but not good either. CON.SDXC didn't exist a couple of years ago, so unless your camera is fairly new it probably won't support this card. Go to the manufacturer's site and check the product info to be double and triple sure that it works with your camera. No real experience story here, it worked with both cameras I used it with and didn't work with a camera that it wasn't designed to work with.All in all, don't bother. You'd absolutely be better off buying two 32gb Class 10 cards and an extra battery, or one 32gb card and two extra batteries, etc, than buying this card. I can't see a true purpose for this card other than for size queens or sports photographers; but they're using CF cards. I rated this as it stands as a product, but there is virtually no marketable use for this other than maybe for expandable computer storage, in which case a 1TB portable hard drive is still cheaper. Heck, a 128GB SSD is cheaper than this!""
"20110121","5.0","Incredible amount of memory","32 GB of memory is probably more memory than I will ever possibly require.

I'm not quite sure it's actually a 10 speed card but I'm getting about 20mb/sec speed when I read/write to this card. So good enough for me for the price I paid.  I'm sure a 10 speed Sandisk is going to be quicker but it's also a lot more!""
"20110118","4.0","Excellent Card!!","I tested the card with several speed programs and highest I got was 15 MB write. This could be from using Sandisk micromate.

"20110118","4.0","Only 5 pics in continuous mode before buffer fills","I'm not sure if this is the camera or the card so I won't unfairly ding the product but you should know that I have a Canon T2i and in the highest resolution setting under any of the manual modes (AV, TV, M) the camera will snap 5 pictures (in continuous mode) before the buffer fills up and you have to wait a few seconds to snap again. I'm a little dissapointed because my Canon Rebel Xsi has about half the resolution and when using a only class 6 card I get the same behavior. I was hoping that I would get 8 or more pics in continuous mode using this class 10 card and newer camera but alas I don't. For mere mortals this will be completely acceptable. But it makes me wonder if the money's worth it to move to class 10 when I get the same performance from a name brand class 6. So again, I don't know if this is the camera or the card, but if you were planning on shooting 5+ pics in continuous mode in high res without filling up the buffer, you won't - 5 is your limit. Fortunately I can live with that. Was just hoping for something more impressive.""

Unfortunately the Transend 32GB card is no where close to class-10. In fact it is about half the speed of my Transend 16GB class-6 card.

I am sure that the sandisk extreme 10 class card is superfast but this card is fast enough for me since it works perfectly. Would I buy the Sandisk? Of course not.

According to wikipedia ('The Class number represents a multiple of 8 Mb/s (1 MB/s), and meets the least sustained write speeds for a card in a fragmented state.') this card does not meet the requirements to be labeled class 10.Almost 1.5 MB/s slower than supposed to be means 15% less data per time frame.On the other hand one should consider at the time when I bought it it was the cheapest 32 GB class 10 SDHC card I could find plus it is noticeably faster than a class 6 card.""

It is not a real class 10.  A class 10 means its MINIMUM write speed is 10 MB/s (megaBYTE not megabit).  The 60D records video at about 5-7 MB/s and during recording, it will tell me that the card is too slow and it has to buffer to catch up.  There have been multiple times in which it has automatically stopped recording because it was too slow.  Since the Canon T2i also uses SD, I suspect it will do the same thing.  I got a class 6 sandisk SDHC card and it works perfectly, not a single problem.  For pictures however, this card is fine, but it is not a class 10.""

I know some had some comments regarding write speed, but honestly unless you have a need to shoot multiple images very quickly and frequently, you will never notice the difference.  I can understand why a professional photographer would go with a higher write speed, but the cost is just too prohibitive for most.

I told them to purchase this card because I have used transcend products for a few years and have had absolutely no issues with there cards, and for the same price as the 8gb sandisk card we could get 4 times the storage.The card works great with our camera, never have any issues filming on it, you won't get as much of a burst buffer out of this as the more expensive sandisk, but you don't need those speeds for video or casual photography. Transfer from the card to our editing station is quick, can't really tell the difference from our sandisk card.

"20101227","5.0","It does the job very well for my application","I've seen most all of the reviews here for this item's rating on read/write/transfer speed in cameras.  That's all well and fine, but my application is a GPS, a DeLorme PN-40 to be exact.  I purchased this card to keep all my TOPO9 maps so I won't have to load and unload whenever I go to different places to geocache.  Note, if you have a PN-40 and want to load the entire TOPO9 series, you WILL need a 32GB card.  Keep in mind now that the formatted size is 30.2GB, but yes, you will have a lot of space left over for POIs, too.Let's talk speed.  I also have a Garmin GPS, and map update downloading takes about an hour or so for roughly 1GB transferred and configured mapping to internal memory.  I inserted this particular card into my laptop, formatted it to FAT32, installed to my DeLorme GPS, fired up, and the card was immediately recognized.  I began to install the TOPO9 maps through my laptop (lower 48 only) and watched the process.  Two hours went by and only the first disc of four had been loaded.  Upon looking at what had taken place, I saw that over 4GB had been written in two hours.  A quick calculation told me that was about twice the speed as the Garmin download.  In the end, close to 22GB had been written in about eight hours.  Not bad at all in my book.  There was right at 8GB of space left over for POIs and waypoints - far more than I'll use, I'm sure.As for boot up time, it now takes the GPS about another 12 seconds to boot up and begin looking for satellites, than it did with no card in the slot.  Again, not bad at all.I bought mine at a very competitive price, but I see the price changes constantly.  If knowledge serves me correctly, this card, as all memory, is a commodity item, so the price will fluctuate.  When I bought mine, the price had changed three times in one day.  I got mine in the middle of the range.  Keep watching it because the price will change because it's the nature of the beast.I can't fairly compare it to the others at twice or three times the price, but I can say I am very pleased with the performance.  I have not tried this card in a camera, so I cannot rate it one way or the other in that application.  For the money, this card does the trick in a GPS.""

"20101227","5.0","Good Flash Card for SSD HD Camcorders!","I did the research on flash memory cards from several of the larger companies and read reviews on camcorders.  The negativity that people express with 'speed' is due to their own fault of not checking all the specs on camcorders.  As it stands, Class 10 memory cards are the fastest out there.  They are designed specifically for video.  A Class 4 or 6 works fine for digitial photos but not video due to the frames per second that can be written to the card.  The 'read' also allows for quick playback without any shuttering in the video transfer from the memory card to the TV!  A new format will be launched with Sony and a few others to 'standardize' the industry so all SSD will work interchangably (so I presume).  Regardless, when you read reviews on camcorders being slow, take heed that they are likely complaining about the flash memory card being anything less than a Class 10!  By the way, a 1280x720p video lasting about 8 minutes consumes 728MB of the memory card.  Might want to have a few of these if you are shooting in 1080p (i = interlaced) but regular video in non-HD format will use significantly less memory.  Nonetheless, I find that 720p is quite sufficent for almost all video playback needs unless you are a professional.""
"20101226","1.0","Are these cards Mac compatible?","Not sure if anybody else has experienced this. I recently bought two of these cards and without testing them at home took them on a road trip. I normally use a Mac for all photography related work but on the trip had only access to a PC. I backed up the cards to the PC on the road. Upon returning home, I stuck the cards and reader into a Mac to download the pictures. One card read briefly and then Mac started giving me the 'You should eject the media properly etc. etc.' The other did not even show up. Perplexed, I tried the cards on a PC and lo and behold they were readable. Took them to a second PC, and while one read fine, the other one now showed a card on which the files were corrupted. Brought the good one back to the Mac and again the computer failed to recognize the media. It seems like once inserted into a Mac these cards behaved real strange and subsequently became unusable.Other non Transcend media read fine in the SDHC reader so it was not a problem with the reader.I have to sadly dispose of these cards as they are of no use to me.My backups performed on the road saved the day for me. My first experience with Transcend is a strange  one. I will look elsewhere.Also, the cards that arrived were Class 10 however, the face label was not black/grey but orange/yellow.""

I use this SD with a Camcorder that has a very high bitrate, since it is a 60 fps @ Full HD, so I needed a fast SD in order to write on it without getting errors. It worked fine so far, and I'm happy with it, I got a nicely working 32 gb card without raping my wallet on a Sandisk Extreme, faster for sure but probably a speed I don't need for my application.""
"20101226","4.0","Great speed","I purchased this card after reading/watching reviews on amazon.com, I could not say anything technically about this card but this is perfect card with great speed for my Canon rebel T1i DSLR camera for both snaps & HD video.""
"20101224","4.0","Slow but Great Value","At the time I am writing this review, the Transcend 8gb class 10 SDHC card is priced at an incredible value.  That is the primary reason why I am giving this SDHC card a high rating.  Frankly, as far as class 10 memory goes, this is a pretty slow card, and I think it performs more like a class 4 in terms of write speed.  However, for most people, this card is really fast enough.  It can copy images to a computer very quickly, and most people don't even have a camera with shooting speeds that are limited by the memory card.  If you own a dSLR, and speed is your concern, check out SanDisk class 10.  If getting reasonable speeds at a bargain price is your concern, look no further and buy this card.I compared the following four SD memory cards:1) Kingston 2 GB SD Flash Memory Card 2-Pack SD/2GB-2P2) Lexar SDHC 4 GB Class 6 Flash Memory Card 100x Jewel Case Envelope Bulk LSD4GBBE1003) Transcend 8GB Class 10 SDHC Card (TS8GSDHC10)4) Sandisk 8GB Extreme SDHC Card-Class 10 (SDSDX3-008G-A31)I compared the photo shooting speeds and the speeds to copy pictures onto a computer for the four different SD cards. I inserted the SD card into my Canon T1i dSRL, formatted the SD card, and shot in RAW+jpeg (which in this case was two files, 19.5mb and 4.7mb respectively). I timed how long it took to shoot 20 pictures, and then I timed how long it took to move those 40 files onto my computer. The T1i buffer filled up after 4.5 shots, so the remaining shots all depended on the write speed of the memory card. I didn't see too much difference in the time it took to copy the files to my computer, but there was a noticeable difference in the shooting speeds. The SanDisk class 10 SDHC card was clearly the fastest, but it was also the most expensive.Shooting Speed1) SanDisk 8gb class 10 SDHC (24 sec)2) Kingston 2gb SD (38 sec)3) Lexar 4gb class 6 SDHC (39 sec)4) Transcend 8gb class 10 SDHC (45 sec)Copy to Computer Speed1) SanDisk 8gb class 10 SDHC (34 sec)2) Kingston 2gb SD (34 sec)3) Lexar 4gb class 6 SDHC (38 sec)4) Transcend 8gb class 10 SDHC (40 sec)Besides the speed differences, I have not noticed any other difference between these four memory cards. They are all compatible with everything I have (except for a few things that do not take SDHC cards). I have never lost anything on an SD card, and none of my cards have ever broken or failed. However, I do take very good care of them, and I always format the cards after copying pictures onto my computer. Depending on your needs, you may not need 8gb, or you may not need very fast write speeds. If speed matters to you, go with SanDisk...it is the fastest. Otherwise, consider a cheaper alternative.""

"20101219","5.0","Great card for price and direct from Amazon.","This is a great card for the price. It is fast and performs well. In addition, ordering directly from Amazon, selecting 'Package Type: Amazon Frustration-Free,' you can save on shipping too with free standard shipping. Plus a lot fewer hassles with Amazon if you need to return the product for any reason. Note, you will not receive the manufacturer's packaging with this selection, but a simple clam shell case only. I think a lot of the customers who have given this card a bad rating have seemed to actually have problems because the card is incompatible with older devices, not the brand that they bought. Since SDHC is a new SD card format which is able to handle larger memory--SD cards were only able to hold 2GB--they had to create a new format. Check with your device's specifications before ordering these new format cards.""
"20101219","4.0","Good alternative to the big name brands","This memory card is just as functional as the big name brand cards. I was a little leery about buying a card that wasn't mentioned in the manual for the camera, but am glad I did. I saved about 40-50 dollars depending on where I looked for the card in this size.The amount of pictures the card will hold is of course dependent on the megapixels you set the camera on, the lower the megapixel setting on your pictures the more you can take. With the size of this card any novice user will have more than enough room for photos/videos. The item arrived in perfect condition from Amazon and actually arrived a day early which was awesome.The speed on the card is great, those who take alot of pictures will benefit more from this information than someone who only takes a few pictures. Basically the faster the speed of the card, the faster it saves the picture to the card allowing you to take the next picture. Like I said unless you take rapid succession photos this will mean nothing to you. The higher the megapixel of the picture the longer it would take to save due to the amount of detail in the photo. This card exceeded my expectations on all fronts. I recommend it to anyone.""

The only place I did not see a difference with the speed of the card is during night shots that required 1 or more seconds with the shutter open, however I think my camera controls this function as for instance if I took a 5 second capture, then the recording time was also 5 seconds.

"20101213","5.0","So far, so good!  Very pleased with Transcend 16GB class 10","This Transcend SDHC card has been excellent so far.  I've been using more and more Transcend memory cards because they appear to be closing the gap with higher end memory card manufacturers like SanDisk.  Many people have been using these cards for very long periods of time, and although I think there could be very slight differences in write speed between a class 10 SanDisk card and a class 10 Transcend card, I think that most people will not ever use these cards in a capacity to notice much of a difference (if any).  I also own a SanDisk Extreme card (class 10) and I don't notice a difference between the write speed of the SanDisk card and the Transcend card, even when shooting a lot of consecutive photos on my Canon T2i.  One instance that I have heard that it would be worth getting the SanDisk over the Transcend is if you shoot HD video in the full HD mode for extended periods of time, and even then, you would probably be fine with the Transcend class 10 cards for that purpose.As you will probably notice, more and more people are trusting Transcend for keeping their precious pictures safe from being corrupted or unreadable.  I expect that Transcend memory cards will continue closing what little gap there is between their memory cards and those of the top of the line competitors, but their prices will probably go up too (closer to those of the bigger name brands).  In my opinion, Transcend is now a name brand, and I don't even hesitate to buy their memory card products (CF and SDHC), particularly when I see that they cost 20-40% less than their SanDisk counterparts.  I can't knock SanDisk... they are proven, and I have a number of great memory cards manufactured by them, but I no longer find it necessary to pay a premium for their products now that Transcend makes such good and consistent memory cards.""

"20101212","5.0","Happy With This SDHC Card","I was a little reluctant to purchase a memory card from Transcend, mainly because I was concerned about quality control and I typically purchase more well known cards.  Nonetheless, the price was right so I opted to pick up two of them for my point and shoot.  My concerns have been put to rest and I've run them through their paces without any trouble.Some might say that these cards are not quite up to par with a true class 10 card, but for my purposes, that hasn't mattered.  I've been able to capture full HD video with my Canon SX130IS and haven't experienced the slightest bit of trouble.  Image capture seems to be fast enough and the card doesn't keep me waiting.  No unexpected failures or other problems to report so far.  I can get just over 5000 12-megapixel images on one of these cards or about an hour and a half of HD video.  If you're working with HD video, the 32GB cards might be more suitable - but I've always been a fan of using more, smaller density cards than putting all my eggs in one basket with very large density cards.As an amateur photographer with occasional client projects, I probably would opt for a better known brand for some of my critical shoots...but for less critical applications and personal work, I now feel comfortable with using these cards.  Eventually, I'll probably get another 2-3 of these cards since I've been getting into HD video more and the space requirements for that are crazy!Overall, five stars for a good product at a great price!""

You get what you pay for plus some, without the high cost that Sandisk charges. Sandisk charges about $79.25 for their 16GB Class 10 Card. That's more than twice as much money than this very budget friendly Transcend card. Sandisk's card's will not give you a picture that's twice as crystal clear either. If anything their high priced card's will set your wallet back for more than twice the price. Most of these type of cards are mass produced over sea's, and they cost just a few pennies to make, now you get the picture.Do not hesitate to get this very fair priced card. With the extra money you save, you can use that extra money to buy other accessories for your camera. This card is for those of you, budget minded, on a very responsible budget. It's also for those hesitant to spend a ridiculous amount of money, for some big name, when clearly you don't have to. The only big I care about, is big saving, and some extra money left over at the end of the day. You will not be disappointed with this card if it's used under normal, or fast shooting situations. Do not feel that the costlier Sandisk card's will make you a more professional photographer, with a more professional card, nothing could be further from the truth. Now that I think about it, Transcend is also a very big name, and it get's the same job done, for far less money. Sandisk Extreme III 8GB class 10 card cost $79.95 Reg. $89.95. Sandisk class 6 8GB cards, cost about $26.00 that's about as much as this more superior, $26.00 Transcend class 10 16GB card. Sandisk is not even pretending, nor attempting to be perceived as fair priced, or competitively matching the competition's best offer. Sandisk appears to be branded for those making a six figure income, not yet affected by today's tough economic conditions.""

Plenty of storage space for the price.While it is a Class 10 it seems to work at about 8-10MB/s, again for the price I can't complain.Price: 10/10Performance: 6.5/10Upload time: 7/10Worth Buying: YES!Would I buy a second or third.

"20120407","2.0","The frustration is not worth the savings!!!","I bought this for my new DSLR camera hoping to save some money. I've had it for 5 months now and it is VERY hit and miss. It doesn't act like a class 10 most of the time. It feels more like a class 4. I try to record video and it automatically stops recording after 3-5 seconds. Every once in a while I'll get lucky and it'll record for longer. So unless you want to record 3-5 second clips, Do Not buy this card!!! I read all the reviews on this product before purchasing and saw most were ok, but don't be fooled. I'm writing this review to warn you about falling into the same pitfall I fell into by buying this card. Spend the extra 10 or 20 bucks to ensure you're camera isn't going to stop recording during the memorable moments you're trying to capture. You'll wish you spent more and bought a decent card WHEN it does. The only reason I gave it more than one star is that is performs ok most of the time if you're just shooting photos. Other times it'll take upwards of 5 seconds before it'll let you take another picture.""

I used it right out of the box for a weekend event and pretty much used it up a total of 3 times with my canon t3i. With all the footage shot on this Transcend 32GB card, I noticed about 15% of my footage had glitches footage. One clip even showed a green screen a few minutes into the clip. Other times I noticed just a couple seconds here and there where the shots look all 'meshed' up and distorted. I checked the footage on multiple computers from my hard drive and footage is displayed the same way. I used another card that same weekend and didn't have one issue with that card. But this card I am sending back for a refund. I am paying the extra and upgrading to ScanDisk. I can't have a glitch if I am shooting a wedding ceremony.

I save almost a good 30 minutes on a full (!) card and can thus reload quicker.I use these cards for my Canon Rebel xS, Canon S90 and a new Canon SX2100.  You get more for your bang on this card than with a same-brand of just 4GB or 8GB.  However, all memory cards eventually fail and when this one fails, the photographer loses a lot of awesome photographs.  It's the risk one takes as a photographer.

I was unlucky and received one without '20MB/s' printed on it. As one might guess, the performance changed with the labeling change.

"20101112","4.0","Transcend Vs. Sandisk on Panasonic LX5","I will be writing this review for both SanDisk Extreme SDHC class 10 8gb and Transcend SDHC class 10 16gb.I bought SanDisk class 10 and Transcend class 10 for my new Panasonic LX5.  I got both card because no one really did a comparison with a compact camera and I was just going crazy trying to see if there is any big difference between the 2 cards.SanDisk Extreme package box indicated it's water proof, x-ray proof, shock proof, temperature proof. I am not ready to spend $50 to see if it really stand up to it's words.  And I don't think normal people would go through the extreme condition in taking pictures or videos.Cut the story short, I really want to see if there is any difference in writing performance between the 2 cards in a compact camera.  There is a continuous burst mode in LX5 and the manual indicated it is only limited by the condition of picture environment and performance of the SD card.  Within the mode there are 2 different settings:1) speed priority or 2) picture/quality priority.  The shutter speed is much faster with speed priority compare to picture priority.I first formatted both cards out of box then put each card in series of test(3 rounds each setting for each card) shooting at the same object under same lighting condition. The results:Speed Priority:SanDisk Class 10 8gb22-33 shots before camera stopped to allow the card to catch up with writing.Transcend Class 10 16gb22-24 shots before camera stopped to allow the card to catch up with writing.Picture prioritySanDisk Class 10 8gb34-46 shots before camera stoppedTranscend Class 10 16gb27-33 shots before camera stoppedIt seems that at a higher shutter speed, both cards performed very similar under the same shooting condition.  But at a  slower shutter speed the SanDisk definitely out perform Transcend.  I hope this little experiment satisfied anyone with curiosity like me.  Transcend definitely is a bargain with 16gb and almost half of the price compare to SanDisk.  But I am going to use SanDisk Extreme as my primary card and Transcend as backup or on a second camera to ensure i would not miss any shots.""

"20101110","5.0","Solid Value. Just what I expected.","I ordered this card after reading a bunch of reviews on high speed SD cards, with the expectation that I would get a good card at a good value, and that it exactly what I got.The first thing I did was test the card with both of my flash testing programs including h2testw. I have had too many 'fake' E-Bay cards lately.My worst of 3 tests is as follows:  Transcend 16GB sdhc class10ser#Test finished without errors.You can now delete the test files *.h2w or verify them again.Writing speed: 14.6 MByte/sReading speed: 18.0 MByte/sH2testw v1.4This result lands it solidly in the class 10 group and exceeds min test requirements.This is faster than my Sandisk Ultra (12.2/14.8) by a little and it is a larger card, and faster than my 8GB Kingston class4 (6.8/9.6). This is the fastest SD card I have personally tested.I immediately recorded my Daughters College play, all 2-1/2 hours of it, on my Casio H20 high speed camera and the card work wonderfully. Videos and 40fps stills and without issue. No problem at all. I still had 4 GB left when it was over. That was nice not having to swap cards.Overall purchase experience is very good with a very good product so far.""

"20101106","1.0","DESTROYS DATA -- after working fine for just long enough to fool you!","SUMMARY:DO NOT BUY THIS CARD UNLESS YOU WANT TO PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH YOUR DATA. Card worked fine when I bought it, but malfunctioned within the first 400 photos -- malfunctioned so badly that some very technical tools were needed to recover anything at all, and some photos were still permanently lost. Recovering the data requires the attention of a serious data recovery expert or someone with substantial technical knowledge and lots of time.DETAILS:I made the mistake buying this card for my camera right before a long trip overseas. It worked fine on the first few dozen shots. I didn't see any improvement in speed over my trusty 1.5-year-old Transcend 8GB Class-6 card, but that was most likely because the camera itself (Canon EOS Rebel 1000D/XSi) could not write images any faster than that (full-size JPEG, continuous shutter mode, roughly did ~2.5-3 images/second on both cards, with no slowdown after the first few shots).200 shots or so into using this card, I get a sudden mysterious message from the camera when I try to take a new shot -- Card Format Invalid (never saw it in the previous 1.5 years on this camera with 3 other SDHC cards). I look around for a bit, and discover that turning the camera off, pulling the card out and putting it back in is enough to clear the error message, and the previous photos are still visible.I then make the mistake of assuming the problem is just that -- needing to 'reboot' the camera when the card is acting stupid, and nothing else. Over the next 200 or so shots, this problem comes up every 50 shots or so. Then, after yet another 'reboot', I notice that the camera's playback function is only showing the last 30 photos!!!  Yet it shows that there's only 5.7G of space left on the camera -- the other 2G+ _should_ be taken up by the photos I've shot thus far, but the playback doesn't show them.And this happens in the middle of a trek through the Peruvian Andes, several days' walk/horse ride from the first village with electricity, let alone a computer (with lots of once-in-a-lifetime shots on the camera). I pull this card out immediately, plug in my backup card, and wait until coming back to civilization to take a look at the card. Sure enough, the card is severely corrupted -- the directory listing is showing a bunch of folders with weird-character names, and only the last ~30 photos are visible from the computer, too!RECOVERY SUGGESTIONS:Hopefully you'll read this before buying and will not buy this piece of junk card. If you had the misfortune of running into the same problem and losing your data, read on.I have now had time to examine what was left on the card, using tools that are not easily usable to people without substantial technical training. I've managed to recover over 90% of my photos, but this was NOT easy, and I suspect that even some shops specializing in data recovery from failed disks may not know how to get your data back -- this is NOT as simple as just undeleting a file!Non-technical instructions:1. As soon as you see the FIRST error involving the card format, turn off the camera, pull out the card, and copy all of your photos to a different device (computer/harddrive/whatnot). The earlier you stop using this card, the safer your photos will be.2. As soon as the first problem happens, move the little plastic slider on the side of the card to the 'Lock' position -- this will prevent anything else from being written on the card, which lowers the risk of what's left of your photos being overwritten.3. If you see directories (aka folders) with weird names when you plug this card into a computer -- or see a huge number of photos missing when you look at them on the camera, take the card out IMMEDIATELY, and take the card to a data recovery shop or a technical expert willing to look at the card in depth. Give them a printout of the explanation below.Technical details:At least in my case, the filesystem was indeed somehow damaged, perhaps by the camera deciding to write over the location of the root directory somehow. I took a full disk image of the card, and operated on the disk image only (there were no read errors when making the image, FWIW). Somehow I was lucky enough to have the original _subdirectories_ \DCIM and \DCIM\100CANON survive on the card intact even though the root directory structure now pointed to a different, new, place on the filesystem as \DCIM.I found the location of the old 100CANON directory on the filesystem by searching for one of the filenames I knew would exist in the old directory, like IMG_7000, across the whole disk image.I then edited the filesystem (yea, with a hex editor!) to have the new \DCIM directory point to the old 100CANON subdirectory. See the Wikipedia article on FAT32 for a reasonably easy reference on how to find the 4 bytes that need to be edited, and how to calculate the correct updated value.Mounting the edited disk image (with Linux's 'mount -t loop'), the directory was intact, and all but about 5% of the photos were completely intact as well -- the remainder must have been overwritten after the directory structure got corrupted. Depending on how long it takes the user to notice a problem, of course, much more damage could easily happen to the original data.Here's one easy hack to see how much you can hope to recover, if you're recovering camera data. The same trick may be useful for locating the JPEGs if the original image-containing directory is no longer intact (good luck with recovery then! I thankfully didn't have to do this). Take any image produced by the same camera, look at its JFIF headers. My camera leaves the string 'Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XS' in two places in every JPEG it creates, early on in the JFIF header. Search for that string across the whole filesystem. If there's, say, 500 hits, that means you can hope for [easy] recovery of at most 250 photos -- any photo that is missing the JFIF headers will be missing the first chunk of the file, and will make it very hard both to find _and_ to reconstruct the remaining data, if any, into a usable JPEG (I have not tried to do this, at least, and it seems very hard).""

If only your shooting RAW files repeatedly then go for the Sandisk, if it's Jpegs then this card will do also.  So as per Amazon's ratings, 3 stars, 'It's Okay'.

"20101023","3.0","Slower than Class 10, but a good price","Be prepared that this card is falsely labelled and does not meet Class-10 specifications.Class 10 means minimum sustained write speed of 10MB/sec for a card in a fragmented state.Brand new, streaming write, this averages below 4.8MB/sec, with spikes and pauses throughout.I tested with the default format, FAT32 reformat, NTFS reformat.  Writing files from Windows, and formatting a Truecrypt volume gave roughly the same results.Small files write fine, because they're buffered on the card before write, even when windows write cache is disabled.Compare this to cheap Class-6 Transcend Cards which get about 5.5MB/sec sustained with very little pause.So, if you want good performance, pick a SanDisk card.If you want cheap, bulk storage with low I/O needs, then this card is acceptable.""

However, the 30mbps is the 'burst' speed. Burst speed is critical for HD camera and for doing copies. I have a HD camcorder and I'm very satisfied with this card after many hours for recording. I bought this card to do 100% of recording so it is the right price. I would buy the other high price brand card of 30mbps if I will do a lot of picture taking.

(And yes, I formatted it in the camera and it recorded fine in the lower modes mentioned above).Luckily, I had another 8GB card, class 6, and I just swapped them.Moral: Use class 6 for the Canon Vixia HF S10!""

"20100824","5.0","great price!","just got this card today and tried copy files onto this card and copy back to my mac and check what the speed is.i was very curious since this card is $5 difference from class6 of the same brand.i also have transcend class6 card, so i compared the result.class10: write 13.5mb/sec, read 18.5mb/secclass6: write 8.5mb/sec, read 15mb/secon wiki says [Class6: 48Mbit/s (6MB/s)][Class10: 80Mbit/s (10MB/s)], so it's about right.the reason i got class6 card 1st was there was 2,500 review whereas 35 on class10 card, so i was not sure getting this one.took 100s of pictures today and seems working fine.still there's faster card like sundisk 30mb/s which probably ideal for more heavy video shooting, but even my class6 card can use it to record fullHD video from my canon t2i no problem so far.only problem i would say is many canon camcorder 2009 model or older doesn't recognize class10 and see it like class4 card or something low, and doesn't let you record FullHD mode. canon doesn't seem bother updating firmware for those old models, so if you are getting one on sale or used, make sure the compatibility of the card.anyway, other review saying this card is slow is not ture. it is standard class10 speed""

"20100623","5.0","Fast and affordable card","Received mine today, although I ordered it from another site.Speed:I noticed that EVERYONE is saying that this card doesn't meet the Class 10 specification standards. So when I received mine, I was VERY skeptical and scared that this card wouldn't meet the standards. The first thing I noticed was that the packaging on this card was not the same as the one in the pictures section. There was no promised speed of 16MB/s write and 20MB/s read. At the bottom, it says Reduced-Plastic Packaging. This really scared me.When I opened it, the very first thing I did was go to the Transcend Product Identification Website ([...])to see if it was a genuine product. After inserting the S/N and the Model Number, the website gave me the results I wanted to get, genuine. Next I plug it into my card reader (SanDisk MicroMate SDDR-113) and put in a 3GB file into it. As it was being copied into the card, I saw that the write speed was a pretty solid 14MB/s write. Although this is slower than the 16MB/s write on the picture, I didn't mind because my packaging didn't promise 16MB/s. Then I copied the same file from my card to my desktop and got sold 18MB/s read. Again, this is lower than the 20MB/s read on the picture, but since it's not promised on my packaging, I didn't mind.Next I put this card into my Canon Rebel EOS T1i and did a continuous 25 second shoot. I compared it to my SanDisk 4 4GB Ultra II Class 4 SDHC (which, using the same method as my Transcend, has a tested 9MB/s write and 10MB/s read). This is where some of my disappointment came from. Both of these cards gave me 61 pictures in 25 +/- .5 seconds. Even though the Transcend has a tested 14MB/s write vs the SanDisk's 9MB/s write, they both had the same results. The settings I used was shutter speed of 1/40, aperture of f4.5, ISO 100, image quality of Large and Fine and WB of fluorescent.Reliability:I gave this a 5 star because I have yet to take enough pictures to really judge it. So far, all the test pictures I have taken aren't corrupt. I recorded a 2 minute and 10 second 720p30 video without it stuttering or having the video to stop for the buffer to finishing writing the video to the card. I was able to play back the video and the video was not choppy at all. Colors were good and sounds were good (but I have no idea if this has to do with the card).Price:I got this for $19 FS from another site, but the price on Amazon is not high either. For a Class 10 card that exceeds it's specification, this is a good deal!Overall, I think this card is amazing. I believe it is a hit and (or?) miss. I was one of the lucky ones to get one that works the way it is supposed to. As some other people have said, maybe it's your card reader that is bottle-necking your card. Maybe it's because you used the front USB ports (which is what I did). Maybe your USB controller doesn't support Class 10 cards.I'm not sure what it is, but my card reader came with my SanDisk Ultra II and my front USB ports gave me reasonable results. Good buy.Here is the picture of my packaging: [...]""

Again, the card never chokes.  I use Large files, (8 - 12+ MP), plus jpeg and/or jpeg + raw.  Never any problems.  This Class 10 SDHC just does what it needs to do and doesn't get in the way of all that I do.  Nothing more to ask of the card.  Reliable, efficient and very fast!  And the price?

They simply drop it in a thin polyethylene bag with no protection and send it bulk (as in junk advertising) mail. For that they charge $4. I was lucky, it was still in one piece when it arrived. Clearly the $4 is at least 75% profit. If you are willing to gamble on receiving a broken SDHC card, then the price is good.

So apparently it must have something to do with the class 10 part, because since I returned this card I bought a SandDisk Extreme III 4GB Class 6 and it works far better.Would I recommend this card? Yes, but only to someone who knows that class 10 will work in their camera. I don't fault the card as I think the problem is with the K-x.""

"20120311","5.0","Great value SD card","SD memory cards are very affordable now with very large capacities.  One thing to note on your SD card is its class rating and speed besides its capacity.  Class 10 is the fastest, but within class 10, there is variation of speed between different cards.I have a point and shoot that is able to record 1080p video.  I wasn't looking to use this in a high performance DSLR that can shoot RAW and JPEG simultaneously.  When I purchased a digital camera at a local brick and mortar store, they gave me a 4GB SD card that was class 4.  I didn't want the write speed or capacity of the SD card to be an issue for recording video.  This card serves my need perfectly at a very affordable price and is a good value.  I do not think this card will meet the needs of someone who uses photography for a living, but for a casual photographer it is perfect.  The price I got here through Amazon was about $5 to $10 cheaper than was being offered at local big chain stores for a comparable card.  I am very pleased with my purchase.""

"20120310","5.0","great value, dont mess around with sandisk get transcend.","Besides the 32gb I own a Transcend 8gb class 6 which I have used for a long time and has serve me well. I have had 0 problems with these cards they are good quality and great value. Years ago this type of technology was nowhere near as affordable as they are now.To get straight to the point I own a t2i and I use it for video and photography. I cant say that I noticed a difference in quality versus the class 6 but I do notice for photography I can get more shots holding the shutter on the class 10 versus the class 6. With that said I maybe not be getting my moneys worth for video mode as you could probably just stick with a class 6 32gb if they sell one, but for me its not a big deal seeing as though the card only cost me 40 bucks which is a decent price for 32gbs!! I used to think 8 gbs was alot for photos but 32gb well serve me even better. I might purchase another one along the way. Ive researched sandisk cards and the extreme they sell that supports 30mb/s is no longer available, and there are now companies on amazon scamming people into thinking the card supports this bitrate which is sad. So I Just stick with transcend because I have bought from them in the past and they are of good quality. I probably average around 20mb/s on this card but the only way to really test its class 10 status, is by downloading magic lantern and testing it out on the qscale.""
"20120309","1.0","A good buy if you enjoy losing data","I lost several days' worth of pictures - the first time I ever had this problem because of a memory card error. I won't be buying anything from Transcend again; buying this was a risk, as I'd never heard of them before. Only reason I bought it because it was recommended by Amazon and had great reviews. Complete disappointment.  I returned this for a refund and bought a SanDisk HD Extreme Video memory card which cost about $10 more; totally worth it, I know SanDisk and their cards haven't ever given me problems.""
"20120309","5.0","Overwhelming performance","I did not want to compromise when it comes to high definition quality and that is why I put my dollars on Transcend 16 GB SDHC class 10 flash memory card.

My recent holiday trip to Hawaii with my family was great, thanks to Transcend class 10 flash memory card. I was clicking away hundreds of photos and I did not have any issues so far. Even large video files loaded instantly. The card is a good buy.""

The card works great, and I swear it makes the camera faster when I am taking those rapid fire shots. I am so pleased I am back today for a second one for my husband's camera. This is such a great value and has worked well for the hundreds of shots I've taken so far.""

"20120224","5.0","Reliable SD Cards","We have been using these cards for over two years now in our Canon EOS Digital Rebel T1i.  We also use these cards for our daughter's Canon point and shoot.  We have purchased the 8GB card in the Class 6 and Class 10, 16GB in Class 10 and 32GB in Class 10.  There has never been an issue with any of these cards that we have purchased on Amazon.  Maybe it's luck of the draw but we have been extremely happy with how these cards have performed.We shoot in RAW and occasionally shoot HD video (720P).  The maximum number of shots that we can fire off before the buffer fills up is 9.  There has never been an issue with jitter while shooting video; it has always come out clear and smooth.  We aren't getting out our stopwatch to time the transfer from the card to the laptop... for 400 pictures it took less than 10 minutes to import into Aperture.  For our DSLR, the 8GB card holds about 375 photos, the 16GB holds about 750 photos and the 32 GB holds about 1,500 photos.Folks, with memory cards this cheap, why are you re-using them?  We purchased a few Pelican cases (0910-015-110) to hold our cards as we have finished using them and simply load a new card instead of clearing an old one and re-using it.  As of the time that I am writing this, it costs $9.99 for 8GB of Class 10 memory, $15.98 for 16GB of Class 10 memory and $37.98 for 32GB of Class 10 memory.  For prices that low, we are not recycling our cards; we are buying new ones and storing the old ones.If you would like to register your cards with Transcend, you will need to get the retail packaging as the Amazon Frustration-Free packaging does not include a registration number.As I said above, we have been extremely happy with these cards.  We will continue to purchase them and recommend them to friends, family and colleagues.""

"20120222","5.0","Excellent Write Speed with USB 3 Readers","I've noticed a lot of people who've said write speeds are slow on this card. Keep in mind that a LOT of things affect write speeds. If you use a card reader built into a printer you will get slow speeds. If the card is close to full you will get slow speeds. If you have a cheap card reader IT might be the bottle neck.I recently purchased a USB 3 card reader, as my new motherboard has a couple of USB 3 ports. WRITE speeds for this card went through the roof. I downloaded a 4 gigabyte movie to the card, [keep in mind big files transfer faster] and it averaged 21 megabytes per second. That's twice the rated speed of the card. [Rating is based on minimum write speeds--Class 10 cards should give you no less the 10 MB/sec if there are no bottle necks.]The next movie I loaded was about the same size, but the card was nearly full and had had a lot of deletes, so the file was being scattered all over the card.

"20120222","1.0","Not For Transferring Files","Transcend products are cheaper than SanDisk products for a reason.I struggled trying to transfer files (less than 4MB) from my computer to this card. I continuously received 'Delayed Write Error' or ''The disk in the destination drive is full. Insert new disk to continue'' (when the disk was 2% full) messages and could not transfer the files. I reformatted to NTFS, but still had the problem. I assumed the card was defective, so I returned it for another one. The same problem persisted with the replacement card.Forget trying to contact Transcend support ...they are completely unresponsive (they probably know they can't solve the problems or are so overwhelmed with complaints that they can't respond).I figured: 'Well, SanDisk is a little more expensive, but they have good reviews. I might as well try it.' Received the SanDisk card and, within an hour, I had transferred every file, that had failed to transfer onto the Transcend card, onto the SanDisk card without a problem.I guess you get what you pay for after all.""

"20120222","4.0","Inexpensive, but limited write speed","A dollar per gigabyte? How can you go wrong? For the most part, you can't. But if you do high-resolution continuous shooting, it's going to slow you down. With a 16 megapixel Sony Nex-5n set to store RAW plus fine JPEG, the camera fires off a quick half dozen shots, then slows to about one per second. With fine JPEG only, I got 10 or so shots in a 1-second burst, then about 2 per second thereafter. Standard JPEG is only marginally better.The good news is that I never shoot burst/continuous, so this isn't an issue for me. These cards are so inexpensive you could just file them away when you fill them and leave it to future generations to sort out your images.The other good news is that I can shoot HD video (60p) on these cards with the Nex 5n or on my Canon Vixia HF M40 camcorder. That's good enough for me.""

"20120214","3.0","Generic","I bought this card because I found out that I needed faster memory cards to record full HD on my new T3i. I read a few reviews on this card and thought that for the price it would be worth having a big memory card so I can record a lot on it. This memory card can hold approx 96 min of full 1080p footage from a T3i, according to the T3i manual its 330 mb/min. So the size and for the price it is good. T3i require class 6 or above to record HD effectively. So I purchased this card as well as a smaller 16 gb from the same brand. This card does well for photos but can be unreliable for filming. Its not as fast as it claims to be and I have had a few times where my camera has stopped recording automatically because how slow the card is, I would classify this card more close to a border line class 6. For the majority of the time recording is fine on this, but if you want something more reliable I would suggest going with Sandisk class 10.

"20120205","5.0","Less is more...","I remember when I got my Nikon D50 SLR 6 years ago that a 1 GB card was about $70.  I choke thinking how cheap they are these days in comparison and come in class 10, but all technology comes down in price.  Since they are so inexpensive these days I find myself transferring my images onto my laptop and external HD and then keeping the card as my 'digital negative' in a SD card case as a final backup, esp. for trips such as Alaska, Hawaii and other more expensive trips that I'm not likely to take again.  There's no way I could do that back when cards were so expensive - I'd be broke with all the traveling I do.  Since I use the card this way I don't want an 8 GB or higher SD card - for me anyway that becomes too much storage and I'd rather keep it short and sweet so 1 card equals 1 trip.  4GB is a lot of images even on the highest resolution setting.  It may not be all that much for those using it for videos, but according to my newest point and shoot that does 1080 HD recording it gives between about 25-30 minutes which is still pretty respectable.  I don't use the video function so it's not a concern for me, but I think that amount of time would be more than enough if I ever did want to record something.I like Amazon's frustration free packaging as well.

That way I can put one in the computer and have the other in the camera at all times. Take one out, put one in. You won't forget your memory card that way. Of course if you plug the camera directly to the computer it won't be a problem then, either... Ok, well if one goes bad you'll still have one. Ha. Did you know SD cards are waterproof (up to 72 hours in 1 meter of SALT or fresh water), withstand temperatures from -13F to 185F, can withstand drops up to 16 feet, vibration proof, survives being run over by a 5 ton delivery truck, and magnet proof? Oh, and x-ray proof, and can withstand 500Gs of shock. in case that matters. Just found that out, kinda good to know if I drop my camera 16 feet in Alaska (most of the year) and the memory card pops out and into a puddle, gets run over by a truck and after all that I forget that it's in my pocket when I get an x-ray, it will still be ok. I wonder if it would survive being swallowed... If you get the urge to test that, you might wanna try it with a microSD card. Just a thought.

"20120531","5.0","Mishap in shipping, quickly resolved by Amazon!","I had ordered a couple of LED monitors and some PC peripherals from amazon, and I had ordered this 32gb SD card separately. They bundled it with my other orders though, and when it had arrived in a really large box, it wasn't there. I checked the delivery status online and it said it had been delivered. I checked the packages again to no avail. So I got in touch with Amazon through live chat and they said it was nothing to worry about, because they would overnight *another* one to me!I was surprised to see they would send me another one no questions asked, but at the same time relieved. When you package large things into a very large box, I assume they must have forgotten to put it in the box or something. I'm glad it was resolved quickly though!Another reason why I love shopping from Amazon and their representatives!""
"20120531","1.0","Not sure this is a Transcend! ?","I have 3 other Transcend 32GB SDHC cards (exactly same specs as this one). The others, however, DO fit into any device I put them in. But this one that I just ordered does not seem to want to fit. It does feel a very very slight bit thicker than the other Transcend cards that I have. I tried it in multiple devices (camera, PC, video cam) and it feels like I have to force it in. Once in, it won't 'spring out' like the other cards do, it seems to get stuck every time, in every device, and I had to use tweezers to pull it out!  So beware on this one -- I am not sure whether this is a true Transcend SDHC card. If it is, maybe I just got a bad one (or reject/second).""
"20120531","5.0","Keeps up with Sony A77","This is a great little flash memory card, very easy to use. It fits perfectly into my Sony A77 and into the slot in the front of the laptop.

I always reformat my cards every month and have never had any problems or corrupted cards.  8GB is a really nice amount of space to have.  I wouldn't really want a card any larger because I wouldn't want to risk putting that much data on one card.  Not to mention, larger cards are very expensive so if it does get corrupted, you loose a lot of money and a lot of storage.

I'm not posting specific speed specs on here, because others already have.It's a decent card and the speeds are incredible. I take more pictures now of my 4 month old son than I did before simply because transferring the photos is so much easier now.For those wanting to know about how many pics you can store, my 4GB currently has on it over 800 pics at 10 MP setting, this card should easily be able to hold over 3000 pictures at that same resolution.""

First time I used it and put it into my card reader, the plastic seam that seals the top part of the plastic cover to the bottom completely split, and basically left me with a memory chip and a broken cover that was in two pieces. I have used many different cards and many different readers and never had this happen before.  I didn't push the card in too hard either, it was normal use.  Obviously a defect in the plastic cover.  Sent it back for warranty replacement, and they refused to replace it and sent the original back saying it was broken due to misuse/abuse.I will NEVER buy a Transcend product again, and the more people I can encourage to do the same the better.  I bought this card because it was the cheapest even though I wasn't familiar with the brand, and it cost me.  I'll stick with a better name brand from now on.""
"20120121","1.0","Garbage","I ordered this SD card paired with a new Canon camera.  The product was recalled 2 weeks after it arrived due to a bad controller that would not allow transfer of large data files off of the card.  Never mind the fact that we bought this card to photograph the birth and few first weeks of life of our new baby.  2 weeks after the recall, images on the card started corrupting.  I returned the card to Transcend, and they said they would not honor the product recall because our card was 'damaged.'  It is not clear to me how this happened, but apparently their crack team of technicians opened the card and found a hairline fracture in the memory stick which voided the warranty.  Their logic was, yes, we sold you a defective product, but since it was somehow 'more broken' after I bought it, they would not honor the replacement.  Their customer service manager was less than helpful.  In fact, he took extra time to educate me on the nuances of the electronics business.  'You don't understand how business works.  You can't buy a Cadillac from a dealership and when the catalytic converter gets recalled you smash the hood with a sledgehammer and expect to take the car back to get a new one.'  He must have learned this analogy in B school before he took his customer service position at Transcend.  This is no Cadillac, don't buy it.""

I purchased the 64GB version and when I plugged in the SD card I was only able to utilize 27GB of space (even with the recommended SD formatter).  A complete waste of my time and the sellers.  Hopefully yours won't be a lemon too.  DO NOT BUY!""
"20120120","1.0","Who cares about speed, when the shell it's in is junk...So is the warranty","Had this card for six months, and it started giving me problems R/W errors.  Since I had never abused the card (it sat in my second SD slot as backup in a Nikon D7000) I sent it to Transcend with an RMA.  Long story short they did not Honor their warranty saying it was 'physically damaged'.  I was quite surprised, there was also a sticker demonstrating the separation of the plastic shell. I've got 5yr old mmc cards, and know how to handle these things, this Transcend is just plain cheap.  Uploaded a couple photos showing just how crappy the casing is.""

I am taking photography and came into a camera recently, and just so happened to need an sd card, unknowingly of course, and my subconscience accidentally made me click a little too fast an purchase this. It is not a top of the line card in any way, shape, or form, and I was surprise it had class 10 attached to it, it runs more along the lines of class 4 speeds, and on a good day class 6 but only once or twice has it happened. The storage space was something that I needed and, suffice to say it works just as it's supposed to which in today's market is rather enjoyable. I will potentially update this when I have used this a little more but for now it's an okay purchase, I wouldn't say its mind blowing or even above average, but it works decent, and it is something that if it sustains its reliability, may potentially change my mind.""

With my personal experiences with Transcend, they have trouble popping out of my camera, to a point to where I need a knife or toothpick to dislodge the chip. (Insignia NS-DV1080P)For the highest end cameras that support SD for some odd reason, this card would, again, be great for mass storage, but it will not be able to compete with the speed of storage of higher end SD cards and even the lowest level of CF cards. Class 10 means 10Mb/s in transfer speeds from the camera's image buffer which equates to be able to take about 3 - 5 pictures a second. A CF card is more expensive for the size, but it offers at least twice the speed.""

It appeared that all MTS files except the first one were corrupted. Thus all but first 10 min of recording were lost.I then replaced the media with Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 10 card.

I purchased another $49 file fix program for video files but still haven't had any luck.  I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased.

"20120108","1.0","Complete failure (dead) after 5 months use.","There's nothing quite like a data storage device suddenly dying to give a sick feeling in the pit of one's stomach.  This Transcend card worked fine for about 5 months as I continued to take photos and video using a Lumix ZS3 camera.  Every few weeks or so I would pull the card out, backup my latest photos using the suppled Transcend USB card reader, then return the card to the camera.Suddenly, and without warning, the card went dead the day after Christmas.  This was not just a file or FAT table corruption commonly reported here.  The card simply became non-responsive, giving an 'Memory Card I/O error' in the camera or similar error when inserted into the USB card reader.  All the usual tricks of data recovery were useless since the card was simply not responsive to gain access to the stored memory.  Fortunately my loss (because of routine backups) was only about 20 pictures and perhaps one video.  Even with my regular backups, it could have been a whole lot worse.In looking at Transcend's warranty policy, I was not surprised to see bold type language that excludes data loss or recovery.  Rather, Transcend refers customers to a 3rd part who charges hundreds of dollars without any guarantee of success.  Odds are few people would be willing to surrender a card full of personal photos just to simply get a twenty dollar value warranty replacement.""

Since I was in a bit of a time crunch as a result - needed the camera to record an upcoming vacation and family events - I needed it FAST as well.  The card is quite fast; this Canon supports a 'burst and combine' option for producing the best pictures in low light, and I noticed no lag at all between the pictures taken in the burst (3 shots), and minimal lag as it assembled the images into a single one for viewing.  The capacity is such that I can take as many pictures or videos as I like at the maximum resolution the camera will support, and I don't have to worry about running out of memory.  All in all, I have been very pleased with the card and the purchase experience.""

"20120107","3.0","Fragile and Flexible","I have a variety of class 10 cards, many Transcend, SanDisk, and others. The digital properties of this card are average in my experience. I would not hesitate to recommend this card based solely on digital dynamics (speed, compatibility, etc.). The physical properties of this card are below average. Compared to SanDisk extreme (or some other brands), this card is very fragile. The plastic construction is not well suited for frequent insertions and removals. Many SD readers are designed with shallow card sockets, which means about half of the SD card is external to the device, and unsupported. If the person inserting the Transcend card is not extremely careful, the card will flex or bend, severing electrical connections inside the card. This renders the card useless. There are other brands of SD cards that are much stronger, less flexible and less likely to be physically damaged when inserted into the device. If the card is not frequently inserted and removed, I would not hesitate to recommend this product. Transcend will not replace their SD cards if they fail from flexible bending. This is a very completive market, and for a few dollars more, you can purchase a card with much stronger physical properties.""

It wasn't just us being stupid--we've owned this camera for a long time, and we even brought the cards into a camera dealership just to see if there was something secret that we were missing.There wasn't. For some reason these are junk. Perhaps the manufacturing tolerances are off, perhaps this vendor got a bad batch.

However, still shots were clear and perfect in single mode, and the card had no problem keeping up with write as long as the shutter released was pressed for each shot.With video, even thought it is a Class 10 card, I was having trouble with stuttering. I could not shoot more than 3 minutes at a time without running into pausing issues on the developed video, and eventually spent the money and bought a Sandisk Extreme card to replace it for video and action shots.I am happy with the card over all for my still work and portrait shots. I will order this one again to use for that purpose, but if you are looking to catch that perfect moment when you son kicks the wining goal, you don't want to slip on the shutter release, or have the buffer fill up on you. I did include some images I managed to capture with this card though, and I would recommend it for hobbyists and again for portraits, landscapes, and students.""

Once the card was formatted in camera it has been smooth sailing.  This card provides plenty of storage for photos (even while shooting in RAW+JPEG).  I don't have any issues with writing speed other than an occasional lag if I shoot several frames in continuous mode and I think that is more of a camera writing speed issue.  For an amateur user up to an advanced amateur this card has plenty of speed, beyond that it may be questionable depending on what you are photographing or videotaping.

"20120520","3.0","OKAY but NOT BEST FOR CANON DSLR VIDEO MODE","Camera stops working at random times! The 'writing speed' or the rate of which the disk takes in the video is not fast enough. You need at least a SanDisk hd video memory card. I think it has to be a minimum of a class 20 or something. I just basically got a 64 gb card for photography only now which is a HUGE waste of money. I bought it for video because the ad said it could be and other reviewers seem to have some success with it. But it is not true. It fails about 5-10% of the time!Update to situation: I found out it was because the camera was sorta running out of space, but its not like at 45 minutes boom! - you're outa space. Its like 30 minutes(totally approximating) starts to get unreliable and gives the message movie has stopped recording without any explanation. FOr the longest time, I thought it was a stupid default feature on the camera. I was trying to change the settings. Then I looked online and found that it was actually the card. Then I tried deleting a few recordings and it made things much better. I suspect other higher class cards will not cut out so unpredictably until it truly runs outa film. I have the canon t2i. Hope this helps another canon dslr user.Peace!""

I'm not sad to say that after a week this thing has been a champ.  I'm clicking off shots and downloading to the computer with no problems at all.  Barely used up any room after 75 pics or so.  Haven't shot any video yet and probably won't do much of that anyway since I've got a nice camcorder.In short, for $10 (or for free) it works great for the basic stuff.

There were some reviews saying that it is not really a class 10 card in terms of writing speed. So I did some quick tests. I copied a folder containing 766 files of various sizes and total 20.4 GB onto the card. That took 40 minutes and 59 seconds --> average 8.5 MB/sec. Then I copied 355 files (9.4 GB). That took 18 minutes and 8 seconds --> average 8.9 MB/sec. So in both tests the write speed is a little bit shy from the nominal 10 MB/sec but not too much off. Reading back and binary comparing with the original files from the first test took 28 minutes and 21 seconds. So the reading speed is 12.3 MB/sec.""

I have read about some 32GB purchases which despite being class 10 were disappointing in access speed performance.

Will update this space so pl bear with me until all is clear.I picked the 16GB over the 32GB for the simple rationale being if anything goes wrong with the card, 2x16GB is better risk management than 1x32GB for data recovery.In summary, for simple usage - this card represents fantastic value for pixel warehousing.""

Given this is only an 8gb card, it will not hold a significant amount of photos or video however for short shoots or short videos it works perfect.  Using an class 6 card the 1080p video would seize up after about 5 seconds however a higher speed card allows video to record smoothly with no limitations.Rapid fire photos are also easliy done with this card. With a class 6 card, it would constantly say 'busy' after firing off several photos however this card is quick enough to save images quickly.Benchmark testing rates this card just over 16 mb/s writing and just over 20 mb/s reading.  To be rated a class 10 card it must simply write at 10 mb/s therefore this surpasses other class 10 cards for a reasonable price.I would recommend this card for a multi-use inexpensive SD card.

With so many brands out there it is hard to choose a card or gauge quality. This is one of multiple Transcend cards I have owned throughout the years and so far none have ever given me any issues in terms of recording or retrieving images and movies.As with all cards I would always suggest these do not become your primary storage medium. After every shoot I try to unload all images onto my computer and of course create backups. Furthermore, it is a great idea to format these in your camera regularly. I do it after every shoot but it is probably overkill. Like in a regular drive corruption can build up and formatting clears that up for you if it's not a hardware issue.Overall very satisfied with Transcend and this speedy 32GB SDHC card.""

That's all I need from a memory card. anything else you need to know about the SDHC card format you can find on wikipedia, so I really only have one thing to say to you:When it comes to class number, remember this:1. If you're not using this for your hd camera, than class number (these are 10s) does not matter2. A class 10 WILL give you better hd video than a lower class sd card will.3. A class 10 MIGHT give you better lapse time between being able to take pictures with your digital camera, but that difference only goes so far and will only be noticeable if you're taking hi-res pics (like 10mp or higher) or video.Hope this helps!""

Previous to this purchase, the only memory cards that would work for HD Video were an 8 and 16GB Panasonic Class 10 Gold Cards I purchased for a significant amount more than any of these inexpensive Class 10 cards.  Until finding this card, I thought to do HD Video I would need to buy only the Premium cards.  I have bought another Transcend for HD Video.

"20111122","5.0","Fast, Reliable, Great Capacity","This review pertains to both the 16GB and 8GB cards which I purchased at the same time.I've been using Transcend cards for about 3 years, and now they've become my standard for my digital cameras. This is the first 16GB card I've gotten, and it's just as fast as the 8GB. It's faster than two other manufacturers but I'm not knowledgeable enough to say why.My camera is capable of 8 frames per second in burst mode, and the card handles that very well. (I have a 2 GB card that doesn't, but it shouldn't be expected when the card will fill up in a half-day's shooting.) And, on the download to the computer directly from the camera, I downloaded 131 high resolution (approx 6MB each) in 54 seconds! That's fast, fast enough so that I may never use my card reader again.I do not take movies though I have the capability. This card will be strictly for high res picture taking. So, why 16GB. Well, I figured that I wouldn't have to start a new numbering system for my photos next year. I've found that with 8GB cards, once I reach 10,000 photos in a year, the camera and the card seem to start over and I have duplicate numbers. This might not be a function of the card, and if not, I'd actually appreciate someone telling me that.Btw, the 8GB Transcend card has probably been formatted 250 times in the last year. Not one problem with it, and I fully expect that the same will be true with this one.""

Looking at it closer I found that the side of the card where the switch was located had split. The card is less than a year old and was well cared for. I followed Transcend's RMA process and sent the card to them. I received it back today with a note saying that there was damage to the card and that they would not replace it. I guess they are referring to the manufacturing defect that caused the card to split. In any case I suppose I should be happy that I'm just out the money for the card after reading some of the other reviews.

"20111105","5.0","No complaints","It's an SD card.  I've never found much to distinguish one card from another, and the thing I care about most is reliability.  I've been using two of these cards in my Nikon D7000.  The camera has two SD slots, and I use a 16 GB card for jpegs in one slot, and a 32 GB card for RAW in the second slot.  So, for every picture I take, I get a jpeg and a RAW file.  I've found this convenient.  It allows me to send quick snapshots to people when I'm on vacation, and when I've got more time I can tinker with the RAW images.  The Transcend cards have worked perfectly for this arrangement.  They're fast enough such that I never have a problem with buffer space (and note that 18 megapixel RAW images are large).  Most importantly, the cards have never failed.  They even work reliably in my MacBook Pro, which has an idiosyncratic built-in card reader.  I wouldn't spend more money for another card, you'd be paying for some fancy adjectives, like 'extreme,' but I don't think you'd get any greater functionality.  The Transcend cards have been perfect for my purposes.""

I purchased and installed a Transcend HC 8GB memory chip in my camera. The camera appeared to work normally - taking at least 550-600 shots with plenty of memory left - I even took 2-3 minutes of video.Unfortunately, when downloaded to my home PC - only about 160 pictures were available to view - I was stunned to say the least - this was a once-in-a-lifetime tour - the photos are irreplaceable.I called a local camera shop, which said they might be able to  recover the rest. Well they recovered another 200 or so (charged me about $45), but the first three days of our vacation's really interesting photos, they could not recover.However, they had a recommendation, another company nearby, which does digital work for the Department of Defense, might be able to help. I called them and they quoted a price of $500 dollars over the phone to recover all my photos - if unsuccessful there would be no charge. Money doesn't grow on trees - I'm mulling it over. But I highly recommend NOT buying any Transcend memory chip""

"20111031","3.0","Far slower than I expected","I purchased these through J&R Music and Computer World via Amazon a couple of months ago as preparation for my Paris vacation.  I owned a Class 6 Transcend 8GB card for a long time and it was fast and never had any problems, so I figured I should get two of these class 10 cards as backup as i wasn't going to be bringing my laptop with me.Despite these being class 10 and therefore supposed to be faster, the ones i received are SLOWER than my class 6.  I tested both cards and took various photos around the house and noticed there's a distinct 2 second or so lag after i take a photo.  With my class 6 card, I can take a photo and immediately change to view mode to look at what i just took a pic of.  With the class 10 card when I do this, I get a message saying something like 'recording, please wait' for around 2 seconds before my photo appears.  When taking photos too, with the class 10 there's a very obvious 2 second lag after each photo.I kept both cards because I was paranoid i'd run out of space on my class 6 card and i already tossed the packaging (returns seems to require original intact packaging?  how does that work if i obviously have to open it to test the card? O__o ).  Ultimately my single class 6 8gb card from years ago was plenty for my trip so these two cards were a waste purchase...probably giving one to mom when i buy her a new camera later.in any case, these cards are oddly far slower than my class 6 transcend 8gb cards.  I haven't used it long enough to know if there are any other issues (such as ones described by other reviewers that it corrupts after a few months of usage).""
"20111031","5.0","Perfect for GoPro and other HD video","I bought this for my GoPro HD Hero, which accepts a maximum of 32GB SDHC.  They say that you only need a class 4 card, but the faster transfer rate of the class 10 is well worth it when taking videos that end up being larger than 2GB each.At $45-$55, this is good buy.  It's a reputable brand and won't leave you hanging like some generically branded cards might, and you also can be sure that when they say it is a class 10, you will be getting class 10 speeds.  It's also a great price for the performance... Other 32GB class 10 cards can cost over $100 and deliver similar performance.I can't speak for much other equipment, but my GoPro HD Hero and my Canon T1i will shoot full HD (1080p) continuously with this card with no interruptions.  I would imagine that you'll find the same thing with just about any other piece of equipment.No reason not to buy, unless you don't like a good value?Note: This is not a problem, but the card tends to be a bit 'fat' for some slots, which may mean that it will get stuck or show resistance on the way in/out.  This wears down and isn't an issue after you use it for a while.""

Alas, the envelope was damaged in transit and arrived at Transcend without the memory card. Now Transcend refuses to process my return, saying that they explicitly ask customers not to send in returns in paper envelopes. Somehow, I feel cheated. First, they sent me a faulty card; then, I dutifully wasted time in filling out the return forms that they require, not to mention physically going down to the post office to mail in the return. And they still expect a disgruntled customer to spend extra money to get a fancy padded envelope or box to package the return? Enlightened businesses that treasure their customer base will put their clients beyond reproach in cases like this, and not come up with a mealy-mouthed excuse to deny all responsibility. Do not expect me to ever buy another Transcend product, and I urge you not to either, lest you find yourself having to deal with the same deplorable customer service.""

Not 'Class 10', which should guarantee a _minimum write speed_ of 10MiB/s; but faster.Hasn't anyone ever wondered why these cards cost the same--or even less--compared to Class 6 cards?Returning to try my luck with SanDisk--which costs half again as much; hopefully for a good reason.""

So far it's working well with photo burst mode and 1080p video. I just got the camera but I've rolled off 12 shots in a row without missing any writes (although it took a few seconds to finish writing after I was done) and testing 1080p video with very smooth playback. I think it's up to the task for the Nikon 16mp camera. If you were shooting RAW on say a new 24mp DSLR, you might want to consider the faster Sandisk cards. If you are a professional rolling out dozens of shots in a row, you're gonna need a Sandisk card. For the rest of us average shooters, it's just dandy.""

It saves the little details that the Canon PowerShot SX230HS captures. I of course expected this, but I heard some cards do not. The videos I take with my camera can be put in ultra slow-mo and this card doesnt stop that. It can hold over 3000 images that have 12.1 MP in a 16:9 format, or 20000 images that are less MP and smaller formatted, and a near 20 minutes of Full HD videos that can be replayed in ultra slow-mo. Which I felt the need to replay 20 minutes of film very slowly, but at least I know I can, because this card can capture and hold it. I also remember reading some reviews about cards taking away colours, well this does not, every pixel is as vibrant as the next wether it's black & white, sepia, or a picture of the spring flowers, all colours come out as I remember seeing them as.Glad I got this product because I always forget to download my photos on my computer, and to take more than 3000 highest quality pictures that a handheld camera can take, it would take a good week at disney land to fill this card.""

"20111007","4.0","Good value card","Looking for a cheap card to dedicate to my laptop's unused card slot, to be used primarily as a Win7 ReadyBoost cache - no complaints.Multiple test runs w/H2test show 15.6-16.8 MB/s write, 17.4-20.9 MB/s read.  Read typically is 20.x, but on occasion drops to the low end of the range for duration of a test run - I suspect this is interaction with the Readyboost cache.  I have several other Transcend SD and SDHC cards in cameras, and have not had a failure yet.  There are faster cards, but for the price, this is a good value.As for Readyboost, dedicating 1/2 the card to a 4GB cache noticeably improves program load time and other operations that involve loading large #'s of files. Visual Studio goes from launch to ready in sub-second times for medium size (10-20 dependencies) projects.  Debugging with all Win32 symbols local goes from 10-15s loading the primary DLL sym files to 2-3s max.  Not a substitute for more RAM, but worth the minimum pricepoint.  Using the Class-10 card is a significant improvement over earlier tests with smaller Class-2 and -4 SD cards.  All tests done on a i7-2630, 4GB RAM, 7200rpm non-SSD drive, Win7 pro.""

"20111006","1.0","Terrible company, unreliable product.  SAVE YOUR PHOTOS, DON'T BUY THIS CARD!","Transcend is an unreliable company, with tech support that will make you want to jump out of the nearest window.  The reviewer who said, 'Do you like playing Russian Roulette with your images?!' had it spot on.  DO NOT BUY THIS CARD UNLESS YOU DON'T MIND LOSING ALL OF YOUR PHOTOS.I bought the 16 GB SD HC card before a very important shoot.  Near the very end of the shoot (having shot less than 400 frames total on this BRAND NEW card) the playback suddenly stopped and displayed an error message telling me it could not read the format.  I took the card home where my computer could not read the images through the camera.  I bought a card reader, which was also unable to read the images.  I downloaded Transcend's recovery software, which did nothing.  I called their tech support, and got a woman who spoke poor English and got ANGRY with me when I politely said, 'I'm sorry, can you please repeat that?'  She was apparently the only tech support person on staff that day, because I called back a few times as fix after fix failed, and always ended up with her.  She also seemed upset that I owned a Mac.  Really??  How many professional photographers do you know using a PC these days?  She informed me that I could send the card to their factory in Taiwan where I could wait 3 months to see if they could recover the images.  3 months??  I have a client waiting for these images and a contract to get them to him within 2 weeks!  I asked for my money back.  They won't refund my money, they'll only replace the card!  Why on earth would I want ANOTHER card from a company who can't explain what happened to the last memory card I bought, and can't be relied upon to remedy the situation in an acceptable way?  They made me feel like I was the bad guy for asking them to be accountable at all.  At no time did anyone apologize for the disaster their product had caused, nor offer any real solution for my situation.Don't trust the good name of your photography business or the importance of your family photos to this company!  Replacement or not, I'm cutting my losses and replacing all of my Transcend cards with the far better rated (and higher quality) SanDisk.UPDATE: I was finally able to speak with a manager who was much better grounded and informed than the woman who I had initially spoken with.  He told me they are able to reclaim about 85% of images sent to their recovery center.  He was also far nicer, and at least pretended to care about my situation.  He said I would have to send the product back to Amazon for a refund, which I will be doing.  Conclusion:  10% of cards, according to the number of review here, have failed.  They can recover 85% of images if your card is one of the bad ones, if you have 3 months to wait.  For me, it's just not worth the risk.""

Well I tried a piece of software called H2testw (google for it) and it shows this card writes at 4.3 mb/s and reads at 13.6 mb/s.  That isn't very good.  My regular Sandisk bulk white label 8gb class 4 writes at 4.28 mb/s, but my Sandisk Ultra 4GB Class 4 writes at 10.4 mb/s and reads at 15.1 mb/s...all of these results coming from H2testw.

Then, after 5 seconds it would be normal again.Then it said that the card was not recognized, to change the card or format it.  I turned off the camera to check the card and put it again just to try and it would be OK again.It started malfunctioning at a Champions League soccer game, so I was scared that I would lose my pictures, so I borrowed a card from another friend's camera and put it in and kept taking pictures.When I got home, I tried accessing the pictures using the memory card reader to no avail.  I tried using the camera to import pictures, did not work either.I even used recovery software but it kept saying the card was a 1GB unformatted card.After this I started doing research and found out this cards are flawed.  They have a manufacturing problem and they are recalling this cards.

I have a 4GB class 6 card and the GoPro can't see a difference. But since it cost the same as most class 6's for 32GB I figured why not get the higher class. No problems with this card.""

"20110922","5.0","Supreme value","It may not be the fastest card out there but it is more than fast enough. Most camera's will be limited by their own write speeds not that of this card. No buffer filling problems limiting the lengths of the HD videos I take.Speed will only become a factor when taking things off the card later and it is definitely fast enough.I've had 2 for over a year now and just bought another.Highly recommended.""
"20110922","2.0","Doesn't save all pictures","I bought this card to take pictures with my Pentax K200D, and it appeared that sometimes pictures are not saved (1 picture out of 6/7 in average).

I never had issues with the SanDisk I bought before.""

"20110920","4.0","Great value, but you may want to spend more if you're using this for HD video","I have been using this card for a little over six months now and I'm mostly pleased with its performance. Transcend brand cards are one of the best values in terms of $/gb. The only area in which the card is lacking is HD video. With the T2i in movie mode, the camera would often stop recording video in the middle of filming because the card couldn't keep up. I spent money on a San Disk Extreme SD card and haven't had any such problems. In summary, if you're using this SD card for pictures only, this card is a great value. But if you're looking to use this to film with your DSLR, you probably want to spend the extra money to get a brand name card.""

Run away!","I've never had such a pair of garbage cards in my life; these evil cards let my daughter and I take lots of pictures (two different cameras) of special trips at different times, and then when we try to get the pictures off of these cards, half the files are unreadable.  Can't move them, can't look at them, nothing.  Lesson here: don't cheap out on memory cards.""
"20110919","3.0","Returned it Unsure","I bought one of these cards from Amazon and used it in my Nikon D7000, it appeared to function as it was designed to but when time came to download on to my computer I had issues.  As long as I downloaded from the camera and not from a digital reader it was fine.  I am fairly computer savy and built my own last year currently running on W7 64 bit pro.  The original card reader would not recognize my Transcend 16G card in W7 where it had with all the other 2G cards with my now retired Nikon D50.  I bought a new card designed specifically for the newer SDHC cards and still W7 would still not recognize the reader...  I then used another HDSC 8GB card and it worked fine....  Amazon gladly gave me a replacement and I had the same issue so I returned both of them and stuck with the four 8GB cards from a Nikon reccomended vendor and have had no issues since... What is really confusing is that I know a lot of people have used the Transend 16 & 30 GB Class 10 card for their D7000's and not had any problems...  Is it the 64 bit W7, should I use the 32 bit funtion or just bag it and stick with the Nikon approved cards??  Input is requested...  Thanks  One funny note, I took the original card to a local merchant who put the card in a reader mounted in a pc at the store and it read w/o any problems...""

I did a high level format but not a low level format.  I took a few pictures to test the camera and then put it away.  I used on vacation and discovered that some pictures taken and stored on the card could not be read by the camera-it gave an error message.  I tried to do a low level format, but the card could not be formatted--again gave errors.  I finally got it out and put it into an external card reader.  The end of it broke off in the reader, and I had great difficulty getting the pieces out.  The reader could not read the card anyway.  So it is a total loss.  Don't waste your money on this brand--get a Kingston or other reliable brand instead.  Also-be sure to do a low level format on your card when you get it, to make sure it is working ok!!!""

"20110918","5.0","Amazing Space for the Price","A month into owning the card, and about 16GB into the 32Gb capacity, I'm still very happy with this.  Bought it for my Canon 2Ti, for which it can hold 7900+ pictures in Large compressed format.  Half that for uncompressed.  Card is made in Taiwan, better than from China given Taiwan's experience with memory.I've noticed no issues with speed, and just copied over 4GB into an external hard drive in 4 minutes.  I don't have any software to test actual speed, so I'll just say that I haven't felt any issues when shooting.  One issue I've encountered is when taking video, my Canon will sometimes 'timeout' in a few seconds of shooting.  I have no idea if this is an issue with the speed of the card, or something with the camera's features.  My guess is it's a camera feature, but thought I'd point it out anyway.""

"20110917","1.0","DO NOT BUY - ABSOLUTELY CORRUPT","Bought the card for our new Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX5. Shortly after we got it, Amazon informed us of a recall on the card, which supposedly had to do with downloading very large files (e.g. a very long movie). I contacted Transcend who gave me RMA info to replace. I asked if there were any other issues. They wouldn't respond. Sent several emails. No response. Dead silence. 'We don't care' customer support at its finest.Had no choice but to take the card on our trip, planning to take only small videos anyway (so as not to hit the problematic size) and then return for replacement on the recall when we got back.The card just went dead, absolutely corrupt, will not even reformat (neither in the camera nor in a PC). Abso. Lutely. Dead.We have now lost our entire vacation's photos, movies, and another important video we just made for a non-profit group we volunteer with. This was all mere minutes before I was to download them, for safety, onto my PC.G O N E.I am having trouble finding the words to describe just how small my opinion of Transcend is.""

"20110914","2.0","Missing photos - Corrupt data","I bought this card because of the sheer number of reviewers who stated it was a great card and obviously it was much cheaper than its sandisk counterpart. I used it in my Canon 60D and when I went to copy the photos across to my computer a heap were missing. I put the card back in the camera to see if it was just the card reader but alas the images weren't there anymore.I stopped using it and I'm waiting till I get back from my holiday to see if I can use some data recovery software to extract the corrupt files. In the meantime I've bought the 32gb sandisk and had no problems with it so far.Perhaps I'm one of the few who have received a dud as the numerous positive reviews certainly swayed my initial decision to buy this. This experience has soured any chance of using a Transcend for something as valuable to me as my photos.""

Then the customer has to send the product back to Transend and pay shipping etc and have the proper working card sent back. I am guessing Amazon hopes the customer will just bite the bullet and not bother with the hastle of it all. Apparently the cards work, but slow down after you get 4 or 5 gigs of pics on them. I bought these SD cards because of the C-10 rating. Amazon needs to fix this. Not leave it up to the customers to deal with it.""

I personally never use the 'lock' switch on the card so I wish they would leave it out. Maybe3 it can reduce the price a bit? who knows. It also may add to the durability of the card by having less moving parts (an SD card should have moving parts at all I guess).Anyway, it's a great value for the money.

Test every and each card.For precision test use something that writes directly to the device (avoiding filesystem overhead).
