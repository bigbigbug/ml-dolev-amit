"20120612","4.0","Top Of The Line Pocket Point N Shoot","The Canon S95 is a versatile device that lends users many of the useful features of an SLR at roughly an eighth of the size. The camera offers a full manual mode with a broad range of apertures, ISO levels, and shutter speeds to choose from, allowing those with steady hands or a monopod to produce amazing images at nearly all light levels. All the usual Canon bells and whistles are here--you can define color settings, adjust focal points, etc--but, as an added bonus, the Powershot S95 also shoots in RAW mode. For those unaware, RAW allows for maximum post-production ability, meaning you can adjust exposure, levels, clarity, vividness, etc in a program like Adobe Lightroom once you've uploaded the files to your computer. That having been said, RAW is not a defined format--there are many varieties of RAW floating about, which allow for different levels of control. Fortunately, the S95 RAW is nearly comprehensive, which is impressive given its pocket nature.While shooting video with the S95, you're stuck with whatever zoom length you started shooting at. Obviously, at its tiny size, this camera cannot be expected to feature a superzoom lens, but the tiny 3.8x optical zoom does feel a bit encumbering. Also, the lifecycle of this product is extremely limited; after just over a year and a half, my images now appear washed out and over-exposed, requiring quite a bit of post-work. Granted, I've taken thousands of photos on the product, so I may have simply worn it out early, but the degradation was almost immediate, with no gradual entropy over time. Overall, however, I cannot recommend this camera enough. You may have to buy a new one every 1.5 years, but it's a purchase you'll be glad to make.""
"20120610","5.0","Good pocket camera","I'm a DSLR user who needed a pocket camera I can take to family event where I didn't want to bring my big DSLR but takes better photos and video then my iPhone 4.  This is a great compromise.  Small enough to fit in my camera with much of the features of my DSLR, including RAW shooting and manual settings.  The controls felt so much like my Canon DSLR that I tried using it in low-light situations where I found it produced acceptable pictures where my iPhone could not.  But I was disappointed that the low-light shots were quite grainy, a far cry from my DSLR.  I guess that was asking too much from such a small camera.I was also pleasantly surprised with the quality of the video.  I've stopped using my camcorder and use this for all family videos.Overall, I'm very happy with this camera and glad to have a reliable camera I can bring anywhere.""

"20120605","5.0","My go-everywhere camera!","It seems that other reviewers have more than covered the great technical aspects of the s95, so I just wanted to put in my two cents and share my personal experience after owning this camera for a little over a year. I am the unit historian (aka photographer) for my National Guard unit. Last year, a few of us were selected for a mission to Poland, specifically for which I purchased the s95. It did not disappoint. From action shots to low light, every image was sharp and the color was excellent. At one point, however, I found myself in a Tyvek suit around a lot of water and I passed the camera off to a soldier from another unit. I don't know what happened in the interim, but when I got it back it looked like it had been dropped from a height of about ten feet. There were two deep gouges in the lower right corner of the rear plate, and the plate itself was noticeably bent - so much that the battery door was very difficult to open and the top panel no longer fit properly. Even more unfortunate was the fact that I didn't notice this damage until the next day, mainly because THE CAMERA STILL WORKED JUST FINE! My grip had covered the obvious damage, and it was not until I went to charge the battery that I noticed the scuffing and deformation. I know this is not marketed as a rugged camera, but I must say I've been quite impressed by its survivability. For the last year, I've used it extensively in the field. It's been wet, dusty, dropped and banged around, and my images look every bit as good today as they did on day one. At full screen (not 100%), its pretty hard to tell the images shot with the s95 apart from those from my 50D or T2i. Bottom line: for me, this camera has absolutely earned its keep. It is worth every penny!""
"20120602","5.0","World's best camera","I have had many cameras, DSLRs Olympus PEN etc. For reasons that I cannot fully articulate this camera ends up producing far better pictures than either of my other cameras.The colors are more striking, the images are sharper, and even in situations with high dynamic range I can recover more details with Ligthrooom.Now if I compare the output between my Canon T1 DSLR and the S95 under 'laboratory conditions' the DSLR wins every time. But when I am outside under normal shooting conditions - having to react immediately, frame and compose the picture, manage and deal with multiple decisions etc the S95 ends up with far superior photos.""

I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to find a point and shoot camera that is capable of taking quality photos that I would be happy with. I am awed by the S95's capability. I enjoy the flexibility of being able to take photos in manual mode, automatic, or one of the 'Scene' modes.  The photos I have taken have come out amazing. The colors are vivid and the images crisp. The software that comes with the camera for editing RAW images does a good job and is easy to use.  It is small, convenient for travel and takes amazing images. I would recommend this camera.""

"20120518","1.0","Lens Error and Warranty problem overseas","Several people have already commented about the nice features of this compact camera and I agree, it is a good performer. I own a G10 and liked it so much I bought this camera to compliment or replace it because the G10 is too bulky to fit in my pocket. I read the reviews and bought the S95. All was well for the first few months. Until the dreaded 'lens error' occurred.When it happened I was in Thailand where I spend about half the year. The camera was only about 6 months old and therefore still under warranty. No problem, I thought. There's a Canon Service Center in Chiang Mai. I had used them before to remove a dust particle from the sensor of my G10. They did that for the very reasonable sum of $15 USD and I had the camera back the next day. I took my camera to the service center expecting a quick warranty repair, just as I received for a Toshiba LED TV and my Samsung laptop.Imagine my surprise when I learned that the Canon warranty is only valid in the country where the camera was purchased! The rep at the Service Center told me they could fix the camera but for a cost of almost $300! After a few emails with Canon Customer Service (hah! an egregious misnomer if ever there was one), I found out that not only were the Chiang Mai folks giving me accurate info about the in-country warranty but that even if I were willing to ship the unit back to Canon at my own, considerable, expense, Canon categorically would not accept shipments from a foreign country! Unbelievable but true.As I write this review, I'm back in the U.S. and the camera has been repaired under warranty. However, as if to reinforce my opinion about Canon's negligence in handling my issue from the start, they returned the camera to my home address instead of following explicit and bold-faced instructions in my cover letter to return it to my son's home in Oregon.Needless to say, that will be my last purchase of a Canon product.So, travelers beware. If you are under the impression that your warranty will cover your expensive investment while traveling outside of the U.S., you would be wrong. I was planning to sell my G10 and was glad I hadn't got around to doing that because I ended up needing a backup for the balance of my time in Thailand. I you already own an S95 and will be traveling overseas, take a backup along or you could find yourself without a camera some fine day.""

Because I like the camera so much, I spent the $170 to get Canon to repair it.Ten weeks later, the dials where you choose the function froze.

I bought one for myself and my wife. Now we have two point and shoots. I thought one was enough, but two is much better. According to all reviews I've ready by professional photographers, and blogs of professional photographers about their gear, THIS is the best point and shoot camera for the size and price. It has AMAZING low-light shooting capability without flash, which is one of the most important things we love about it. The quality of the shoots is awesome. And it is very small. This camera is awesome and when people ask me about cameras and I compare this to the ones they ask about, I always come back to this one as being the best, in my opinion. Others like more zoom and are willing to trade off for size and f-stops, while others want a lower price and are willing to trade off on f-stops. That's fine.

The picture quality is amazing as well as the flexibility of the camera.  The low light (no flash) photos are truly amazing.  The various modes - manual, etc allow you the flexibility to take just about any type of shot.  The only downside is that the software that comes with the product is really a relic of the late 90s.  Very poor user experience.  They should look a bit more at Apple or Flip for ideas.""
"20111231","5.0","Price Performance Ratio for P&S Camera: Bar None","This is a model every discerning camera guy must own.  For Price Performance ratio, this is second to none.  If you are familiar with Canon's digital camera over the years, you do not need manuals whatsoever, it is typical Canon pedigree.  Owning to its f/2.0 wide angle lens, on Auto it pretty much hardly fires flashes, in my case it did but once in all 40 indoor daylight shots at our family Xmas get-together.  Before making purchase, did some home works comparing with G12. It cost one clam less than G12 with a bigger better lens, so decision is easy on this one.  Couple things worth noting here, the back color LED screen is truly sharp and vivid in resolution and color, while the pictures shown up on my 20' Dell IPS display turn out to be less perfect. The battery life is about 200 shots with flash, which is considerably less compared with previous Canon models using AA ones, as my A630 does. Well, considering the give-and-take, this again is truly one great tiny P&S camera that shines.  Yes, it is still Made in Japan, a rarity these days for a P&S. Lot of additional features, but AUTO will do good on absolutely most occasions, yes low-light as well, that is what makes S95 famous for.  Should you have any doubts, search online to see more reviews. This is a keeper.""

"20111231","5.0","BIg SLR's  are now obsolete for non-professionals","I couldn't be happier with this camera.  I wanted a high end camera that could do it all--outdoor acitivites, family photos, travel photos and slip in my pocket.  I have been an avid slide film photographer in the past, so I liked the idea of the user friendly manual controls,especially the ring around the lens which  is either shutter, aperture or focal length depending on which mode you are in.  But honestly, the auto mode is so smart and tells you which mode you are in (portrait, landscape etc) as well as what you are focused on, I've not even bothered to use the manual modes yet.Where it really excels is indoor.  If you have decent lighting, the lens/sensor can handle it without a flash.I almost made the mistake of getting a full sized SLR--small cameras have finally achieved the quality acceptable to just about anyone but those who do it for a living.""

"20111230","5.0","Great camera, a couple things on the wish-list","I just used this camera on a vacation with a mix of indoor shots and outdoor shots (nothing really low-light though). I previously just used my iPhone 4's camera but read extensively about using manual controls before purchasing the s95, so I really looked forward to the manual mode. I ended up using the manual mode for almost all of my shots. I usually set it to ISO on the front and aperture/shutter time on the back, and 90% of the time, the aperture is set to largest (F2) to minimize shutter time and ISO. I wish I had known how the custom mode worked before my trip. You can set whatever settings you want and then go into the menu, click up once to get to the bottom of the menu options for 'Save settings' and all your current settings, including the shooting mode go into Custom. I found the auto-WB to be pretty awful, so I had to set the shortcut button to the WB control. Fortunately, the auto-WB is acceptable in full AUTO mode. I wish there was a faster way to switch to AUTO mode temporarily. When I handed the camera to someone else to let them take a photo of me, it was usually set correctly if I had just been playing with it but sometimes it would be a bit dark or light, and it would be too much work to explain how to change the manual settings. I ended up just setting it to AUTO most of the time before handing it to someone else. I don't quite understand when I would use the other three modes (Aperture priority, shutter priority, and Program), and I wish I could just treat those three modes like three more Custom modes with full-auto control that remember their own settings.Overall, this is a great camera with awesome IQ and pretty intuitive controls for a budding enthusiast. I'm going to give it five stars because I got it during the Gold-box special for an insane price. Pretty much everything works fine. I didn't even have to swap batteries (took ~150 shots over 3 days but charged up every night) and the transfer process is dummy-proof using my macbook air and iPhoto (although iPhoto doesn't start up on its own when I plug in the camera but this might be a setting on my computer). I also do wish it had GPS, but I don't think built-in GPS is what I want. My iPhone has such rapid and accurate GPS acquisition since it also uses WIFI and cell towers to locate itself that I wish the camera could talk to the iPhone for GPS location. While I'm making up stuff I want, I also wish it could send files to the phone via bluetooth so then I could choose to instantly share the photo via text message or email or Facebook app.""
"20111229","5.0","I would rate it 6 stars if I could","Even though its a year and a half old at this point and its replacement is out... I still think this camera is nothing short of amazing for all the photographic firepower it packs into such a small body.The S95 is well made and feels very solid. It doesn't have a front grip like its successor does but the textured surface makes it fairly easy to grip and hold onto. It is the only enthusiast compact that is truly pocketable. It doesn't have a hotshoe like the other cameras in this class do. But I really don't see a lot of people attach external flashes to their enthusiast compacts. It sort of defeats the whole purpose.The menu system is like most of other Canon's point and shoots. You have your menu button and then your function button. Both are contextual based on what mode you are shooting in. The main attraction of this camera is the rotating lens ring, which you can customize to what ever function you want it to perform. This is part of what makes this camera so great to use.The zoom range on the camera is only 3.8x. Which some people may find too little for what they do. The powershot G12, which uses the same sensor as the S95, has a 5x zoom, so that might be something in the favor of that camera model if you're deciding on the S95 vs. the G12 (you can't go wrong with either, IMO).This is not a very fast camera, but it is faster than its predecessor, the S90. You will find the Autofocus speed tolerable, though. Shot to shot times are mediocre, not terrible, but some of the other models are a little bit fast than the S95.It's photo quality is excellent considering its sensor size. Colors are vibrant, exposure is great, and sharpness and detail capture are excellent for this class of camera. My observation is that photos are pretty clean up to and including ISO400. There's some noticeable noise at ISO800, but photos can still be usable at that sensitivity as well. ISO1600 is not great looking. But, considering its sensor size, this is a pretty good showing.This camera of course shoots in RAW as well which will help you pull some extra detail out of the photos at higher ISOs especially. The jpegs look good, but shooting in RAW will get you superior results.Overall, given its enthusiast level feature set and its excellent functionality and superb photo quality, this is a camera that I recommend to anybody, novice or enthusiast.""
"20111229","3.0","The S90 was a breakthrough, not this...","Picture quality is very similar and canon seems to be making as few improvements on some P&Ss as possible to sell the next one.  (Perhaps lens' and DSLRs are their cash cow.)I have this camera and a Canon 300 HS (replaced by the 310 HS).  The 300 is even smaller and more simple to carry.  It is cheaper.  Pictures (Auto, Program) are surprisingly close in quality.  So is speed.  The CMOS sensor on the 300 is excellent and not bad in low light.  The 300 is 5x and the S95 is 4x.  (RAW is now even possible with the 300.)Somehow, the smaller 300 has better video (e.g., 1080) and a dedicated video button.Yes, the S95 has some advantages (faster lens but only at the wide end) and a better LCD.  Of course it has manual controls that the 300 lacks but a serious photographer looking for a small camera would be better served by a XZ-1 with its 1.8 - 2.5.  Or get a D3100/T3(i) if excellent photos are what you're after.Unfortunately, the modest improvements (if any) Canon trend appears to have continued with the S100.  Canon is starting to lose me in terms of P&Ss.  Perhaps it is their marketing.""

"20111226","4.0","Possibly the best point-and-shoot in the market today","I'm writing this review from the perspective of a photography hobbyist for 20+ years. The first thing I have to make clear is that you have to bring your expectations in line with what this camera is at the end of the day: a point-and-shoot. It does take very good pictures, but don't expect them to be comparable to those that can be taken with a DSLR -- period.Now, there are couple reasons I gave a four-star rating:* Fish-eye effect is quite frankly atrocious. If you have ever taken pictures with a real fish-eye lens, you'll immediately notice that the effect in this camera is almost comical, looks nothing like the real thing -- not even close.* Not fat-finger friendly. Has lost of controls, nobs, rings, etc. that are small and close together which can be a pain to deal with if you have above average finger width.* User manual (the real one) is online and print only. Which makes it quite annoying when you're on the go and trying to look up certain functionality.* ISO's above 400 yield a tad too much noise to be useful or fit for printing (without some serious noise reduction post process).Why should you buy this camera?* This camera has one of the best image processors in the market (Digic IV), one of the largest photo sensors for a point-and-shoot and relatively low megapixel count -- this is actually a really good thing I wish more manufacturers would start doing.* Very good picture quality, color rendition for such small camera.* Very reasonable amount of noise under ISO 400, degrades quickly at 800-plus.* Tilt-shift (Miniature) effect is actually very good and pretty darn close the real thing.* Lens is reasonably good, very nice and sharp at apertures of 6.3-plus.* Very nice Macro mode with very nice bokkeh (very nice to see in a point-and-shoot).In all, I think this camera is well worth the money and makes for a good 'companion' camera to bring with you when toting your DSLR is just too cumbersome or risky.""

"20111224","4.0","SLR in a pocket!","Everything written about this camera is true:  it's the best low light photography pocket camera in existence.  I took an accidental shot of my dog in Program mode at ISO 1600 and it had very little noise and wonderful shadow detail.  The fine tuning white balance was better than my Pentax K1000D, which is mouldering in a vault because I can't stand to carry it around. :(  The manual control ring, short cut button and Custom modes are a necessity.Beautiful shallow depth of field even outdoors in rainy light (ISO 80, 1/13 sec, f/4.5).  I did a straight shot of some trees and the near branches were out of focus while the far trees were dead on.  I had to contort myself with the macro feature in my A710 to get a similar effect.The bad news:  HORRIBLE battery life.  I don't like proprietary batteries to begin with.  I actually wished the thing were a bit bigger, say the size of my old A710, which this is replacing because the latter's lens finally cracked, to maybe accommodate enough AAs to power it, but oh well.  I think I got 80 pictures out of it before the battery died.  If I hadn't a spare I would have been in a bad way.  Will have to get another spare one.The other bad news:  continuous focus is slower than molasses and blurs every third shot.  I haven't tried the focus tracking yet.I'd like to see more flexibility as to what can be displayed on the screen.  I had to go with a basic vanilla empty version because it had too much information on it for me to see.  The live histogram is nice.I'm too poor to upgrade to Photoshop CS5, 6 whatever it is now, so I had to use the Canon software to process the RAW files. It's actually fairly good but crashes intermittently.  I did convert the RAW files to DNGs with the Adobe DNG converter to save.  I wish the Canon software had a DNG option instead of disk space gobbling TIFFs.I was also impressed with the icontrast (increase shadow detail) feature.  A lazy bum could get away with using icontrast on JPEGs in lieu of processing RAW in certain instances.  The screen is much more contrasty than reality and highlights which look blown on the screen may not be so bad.Don't leave home without it.""

It takes amazing pictures, is very well made (metal not plastic) and has a ton of settings. I'm not disappointed I paid full (at the time you couldn't even find them) price, but envious of all you getting one for $239. Overall, I have nothing negative to say about this camera.""
"20111219","5.0","Canon S95.","Hello all. This is a great camera. The price is low and I could not resist it. It is good for low light. The video quality is not bad either. So overall it is a good buy from Amazon.""
"20111217","5.0","I'm a believer!","I shoot with a full-frame DSLR and I am also a hardcore pixel-peeper, so I was hesitant at first about buying any point and shoot camera for fear that I would find the image quality too inferior to stomach. Too many opportunities went by, however, when I wish I had a camera and didn't have one so I decided to break down and finally get a point and shoot that I could have with me at all times. I researched the matter extensively and settled on this model.The upshot? Boy am I pleasantly surprised by the image quality from this camera. I just wasn't expecting such clean, great looking images. The noise level is also lower than I was expecting. Furthermore, I wasn't expecting such a small camera. I thought the camera would be about 25% bigger than it turned out to be. That was also a pleasant surprise; this truly is a pocketable camera.I'm not going to go on and on because the only important thing you want to know is how is the image quality right? The image quality is the best I have ever seen in a point and shoot, and frankly looks similar to lower end (non-full frame) DSLRs I have used in the past. I am, however, speaking of static subjects in ideal light. This would probably not be the best choice for sports photography. Anyway, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Canon has hit a home run here.""
"20111215","5.0","Great camera","I needed an excellent point and shoot to complement my canon 60d dslr. I went with the s95 over the s100 because of the mixed reviews on the s100. I've used the canon G12 in the past and thought it was a great camera. I've read and tested for my self and found the s95 takes the same pictures as the G12.  I shoot in manual (M) and RAW and this camera performs great. I set the short cut button to ISO for ease of use.""
"20111215","5.0","Worth to buy","I select this product after comparing with other camera. and it does not make me disappoinment.  The only shortcoming is the battery time not long, so you maybe need a back up.""
"20111212","5.0","An excellent camera.","Now that the S100 is out, I imagine fewer people will be looking at this camera, but if you've found a good price, don't hesitate.  This is a great camera.  The lens is f/2.0 at its widest, which is pretty good in low light, although the smaller sensor (compared to a DSLR) will result in more noise.  My favorite thing about this camera is the ability to shoot RAW.  I have two Canon DSLRs and photos from this camera (when taken in good light using the RAW setting) come pretty close to matching the quality of some pictures from my DSLRs, and I'm not using cheap lenses!  This camera doesn't have the greatest telephoto abilities, but who buys a point and shoot for that?""
"20111212","5.0","A great buy, especially at the closeout price","After several false starts trying to cheap out with other super-compacts, I settled on this outgoing model, because the 'latest and greatest' S100 offers nothing I need. First, the clean images and sharpness I am getting are unbelieveable. Grab shots at a party in the Auto everything mode are sharp and relatively noise-free.  For more serious scenic stuff I am using the AV Mode with the lowest possible ISO.Don't be put off by the 10 Megapixels. Ten is plenty, and the 12, 14, 16 are probably interpolated up, anyway.I gave the S95 five stars because it does well what a camera does. While I generally dislike the over-miniaturization that seems to plague the industry, I bought the S95 especially for it's small size. I knew I could have gotten the same sensor and lens with a G-series camera. I can't pick the S95 up without tripping the Playback button, but a Franiec or Flpback stick-on grip will help you get a good hold on it. Also, use the wrist cord. It's all too easy to drop this little guy.All controls are intuitive, and the S-button and outer ring can be customized to your liking. Be sure to turn OFF Image Stabilization when placing the camera on a flat surface for self-timer shots. If you forget to do this, you'll have a reason for blurry shots. If you don't like the cartoonish Kandy Kolors in the default color settings, tune it down to Natural OR shoot raw and process in a decent imaging program.Put up with its few annoyances for the image quality. It is that good.""
"20111211","4.0","Great Little Camera","I'm not a tech geek (I'll save those reviews to the experts) but I will say I love this little camera. The manual features are intuitive and accurate. You can play with this thing for hours and get a lot of cool shots! I prefer to shoot on manual so it was great to find a small point and shoot I could take out and use without dragging around a big camera that costs a lot. The video it shoots is great too. Really my favorite point and shoot camera I've seen so far. Highly recommend!""
"20111209","5.0","A Steal At Today's Prices.","I'm a crop sensor shooter with a Canon T2i and some really nice glass for it. But I don't lug that big camera around everywhere; would you? If I know I'm going out in the woods, I'll take my nice wide angle prime with me for landscape shots. For family gatherings, often the same lens, but I have the Tamron f/2.8 medium zoom 'wedding lens' that works pretty well for that kind of thing as well. I find I don't really use my long zoom very much--just the occasional concert or sporting event, and even then I'm more into the Tamron.Now, I said all that because I wanted to tell you this: probably 75 percent of all my 'keepers' come from the S95, not the big rig. I don't use a case for it--my front pants pocket is its case. It goes everywhere with me, such that any scene I used to use my iPhone 4 to get I now have this pocket wonder to get a real shot of it. It has a very fast 2.0 lens (at the wide end), good low light performance (low-light photog with an SLR is a mixed bag that is highly lens dependent), it is less costly than a single decent SLR lens, and it does almost everything my G12 does while fitting into said pants pocket.I've hung onto the G12 because I was sure I would still use it even though I had the S95 now. But the S95 gets virtually every shot the G12 gets, minus a tiny amount of zoom and a built-in ND filter. I use Lensmate's ingenious bayonet system to attach inexpensive 37mm filters to the s95, giving me all the added capabilities that a good ND or graduated filter can provide. The filter case lives in my car's glove box and I generally don't carry it with the cam--but since so many of my photo opportunities happen when I'm near my car, I can add the graduated filter for high-contrast scenes or the ND filter for sunlit scenes and really extend the already super capability of the little camera that could.You will notice that you can't get as sharp with the S95 as with a bigger, more expensive camera. NO SURPRISE THERE. But there is no camera in its price range that will get sharper, and it is definitely sharp enough for stunning images. The physical controls on the s95 give you full control of shot parameters with minimal drilling into menus. You can do a quick white balance correction in 5 seconds. You can take a focus or exposure bracket. You can shoot in RAW. You can gather so much light with the f/2.0 lens that a white balance-corrected candlelit scene will look almost like the lights are on. You can do a lot of this with many other p&s cameras and any SLR with the right lens. But at this price point there isn't much else that can do this, let alone fit in your pocket (oh, did I mention the pocket thing again? Sorry).What you don't get with the S95 is zoom capability. I find for most of what I do, the big zoom is unnecessary, and I try to shoot at full wide when indoors to take advantage of that fast lens. For the average camera consumer out there, the two stats that matter are megapixels and zoom range. 'What, your camera only has 10 Mp and a 3.8x zoom? A child's toy. Look at this bad boy. 16 Mp and a 20x zoom. How about that?' If you must have the long zoom you will be shopping elsewhere, and I understand that; I have a long zoom too and it is necessary for certain applications--over water, from high vantage points, photographing animals you'd just as soon not get any closer to, your kids' sporting events. But you'll find yourself leaving it at home more, and missing great shot opportunities.I would say the s95 makes a stunningly great second camera--but the truth is it is usually my first camera with the T2i and thousands in glass being my second camera. I drag the monster out when I anticipate photo opportunities--weddings, holidays, family reunions. Plus, any SLR is better at catching fast-moving kids or athletes. But out on the street or on the road or in the woods, the S95 gets me the shot I would previously have only had my phone for. And with this great lens/sensor combination, those shots are really good.You'll find room to grow on this camera. If you take photography classes and read photography books, you'll be able to learn a lot with this machine while mulling investment in more expensive photo gear. In my opinion the G12 is nearly obsolete with this machine. The only feature of the G12 I honestly miss is the built-in ND filter and the overall handling speed, which is a tiny bit quicker on the G12 plus you have tactile controls for all your shot parameters which makes it faster-handling. But the s95 does not suffer for lack of controls. You can still adjust all relevant parameters on it very quickly with the front control ring, 'shiftable' rear control ring and assignable custom button (I keep it on AE Lock, which the G12 also has as a dedicated button).Oh, and there is one other 'feature' of the G12 missing here: a handle. Canon has focused so much on miniaturization that they have forgotten a human must hold the s95 to get those shots. I installed Richard Franiec's excellent anodized grip--an almost exact texture, color and material match to the alloy body of the camera. So between the Lensmate bayonet filter adapter and the Franiec grip, my s95 is pimped. I must say I am a proponent of that grip. Canon has cut into Franiec's business somewhat with the introduction of a small rubber grip indentation on the new s100, which also gets the built-in ND filter.I've seen early-adopter complaints about Canon's execution of the s100's new miniaturized 12.1 Mp CMOS sensor though. They're saying they got better shots with the s95 in virtually all lighting conditions. Personally I think Canon is just months away from a firmware upgrade on that camera that will correct the differences in the sensor and it will be a good one. It better be, for north of $500.If you want the best pocket camera in the world right now, you are looking at it until Canon fixes the sensor on its successor.I love my s95; I go nowhere without it. I have a cheap case I use when I'm not carrying it--but when I am, it comes out of the case and into my pants pocket, the better to be ready for the moment.If while reading this review you realized your photographic priorities are substantially different from mine, you may have lost some interest in the s95. If you found yourself intrigued, you may want to look more closely at it, especially at today's prices. This was a $400 camera not so long ago, and worth every penny. There are myriad options out there; many that can do most of what this camera can do plus a whole lot more--but with more bulk. Others that are smaller but less capable. If your taste runs to the highest gettable image quality in a package that fits in your pocket, you should own one of these.""
"20111207","3.0","Disappointed, but Optimistic","I love Canons.  They're the only brand I will look at when purchasing digital cameras.  I have a Rebel, but purchased this S96 to replace my trusty SD800 (that I've had for YEARS).Out of the box, I was highly disappointed.  The camera has a VERY cheap feel to it, and there wasn't even a basic memory card with which to test out the camera.  Luckily, I always have an extra one in my purse, so I popped it in and set to work.Clarity is impressive (most important part, right?).  The photos seem crisp and the colors are true.  The menu options (as many other posters have opined) really are quite intuitive.  I wasn't so happy about the facial recognition, though, as it has failed to pick up on a face or two that should have been glaringly obvious.I dunno... I have to admit being worried about the durability of this camera.  The shell seems to be so... cheap.  I don't spike my cameras onto concrete, but considering I've got a toddler, my cameras certainly take their bumps.  I sincerely hope this one is up to the task of providing exceptional pictures while enduring the occasional bump to the case.Update:  Two of the pixels were burned out and had to send back to Amazon for replacement.  Amazon's service is AMAZING!  In the meantime, tested out the camera some more and here's what I've got:Movie quality - Impressive.  Sound quality leaves something to be desired if you're not incredibly close to the camera, but the video quality itself is astounding.  Even up on a big-screen, playback is incredible.  It rivals my hand-held Mini DV.  I am absolutely floored by the clarity and smoothness of this function!Flash - works well if a little slow at times.  Remember if you're using auto to make sure the flash is already up and out of the camera before attempting to do your work!  It takes time to slide itself out of the case.Exposure - you can change this pretty quickly if you're into it.  Otherwise, stick with auto which also works spot-on.Red-eye Reduction - doesn't seem to work as well as my Canon SD800.  That surprised me a bit, and I'm wondering if that had anything to do with the particular camera I got.  I'll be double checking this when the new one comes in.ISO - Where's the ISO button???  No ISO button makes me a sad, sad photographer.  Also no selectable auto-focus point.  That made me bummed, too.Outside 'shell' or casing - I'm still not happy about this, because it honestly feels very cheap.Still, picture clarity is downright gorgeous.  I cannot argue with a camera that is capable of taking such stunning photographs.  The price and size of this camera blow its competitors out of the water.""

"20111206","3.0","Not enough Zoom for me","I purchased this and the Sony DSC-HX5V last week to compare.  My old camera is a Sony Cyber Shot DSC-H1 from 2005 with a 12x zoom.  My sister swears by Canon so I wanted to give this a try.  I took the Canon S95 to a wedding rehearsal and the Sony DSC-HX5V to the wedding the next day.  I found the the Sony to be easier to use, easier to focus, and I just loved the zoom.  I am one who can't live without a good zoom.  The Sony has a 10x zoom.This Canon was hard for me to focus for some reason.  It didn't focus fast enough.  Maybe it is because I am used to Sony, I don't know.  I thought I'd give it a try based on all the good reviews, but mine is going back.  I also found it was harder to hold than the sony.  It didn't feel comfortable in my hands--small with no definitive place to put fingers.  The Sony has a nicer feel to it with a spot for your thumb to rest on the back.The CanonS95 is also heavier.  Some like this as it feels sturdier, but I like the lighter feel of the Sony.""
"20111205","3.0","S95: A Tad on the Overrated Side","Bottom line: it's a fantastic little camera, but some things about it are VERY stunted.Cons:-Battery life: the worst I've ever experienced with a digital camera (the first day I got it, I played with it for a few hours and it died after only taking a handful of pics).-Shutter release button: placed awkwardly to the left of what feels natural.-Flash: pops-up where you are forced to hold the camera (very startling and potentially dangerous to the inner workings of the camera, especially if one is gripping the body too tightly upon deployment).-Only records video in 720p (My iPhone can do that). Also, there is no manual control while shooting video.-Lens: not exceptionally wide; not exceptionally long - this rules out shooting in small rooms and zooming into subjects more than 10ft away from you. Lame. Also, keep in mind that when you zoom with this camera, you lose the f/2.0 aperture; it becomes pinched down to, I believe, f/4.9. This is not unique to pont-and-shoot zoom lensed cameras, but it is something to consider.-The protruding lens ring makes it slightly awkward to find a decent (and affordable) carrying case.-No bulb exposure mode!?-Highest ISO settings are saved at a mere 2.5 megapixels, and user has no manual control such as white balance, etc. while taking the photo (here I'm refering to low-light mode).""
"20111204","5.0","This little camera is close to perfection","I took this camera on a trip to Las Vegas, including one day kayaking expedition at Black Canyon. In all situations this camera exceeded my expectations - from night shots of Las Vegas Boulevard to vistas of Death Valley to Hot Springs of Black Canyon, from landscape to portrait to macro shots, from tripod-mounted 1 second exposures of waterfalls to 1/1600 second shots of plane landings. It is very intuitive to use if you are an experienced photographer and should be quick study for an inspiring amateur. It is very small camera while still feeling solid and rugged in use with most of the controls at immediate reach. Large sensor, bright and sharp lenses (while wide open), excellent RAW mode, wide range of ISO settings, good video recording. This is the perfect camera when I don't want to (or can't) take large DSLR with me on the trip. It fits any pocket, very quick to start with quick focusing - ideal for snap of the moment photo. While in kayak I simply stored it in the zipped plastic bag in my life vest's chest pocket and it was there for me at any time. Try doing it with any larger camera!

"20111203","5.0","S95 vs S90 vs S100","This review is for people who owns a S90 considering upgrading to S95 or S100.I own a S90 since it first debuted and have been very happy with it.  Monday I went to a local camera store and compared S95 vs S100 back to back including image quality on ISO 80 at 28mm & here is my impression: S95's image quality is noticeably superior, S100's image looks more washed out. S95's image is more consistent from center to corners but S100's image has 1 or 2 soft corners. At this focal point, S95's lens is brighter so has faster shutter speed. At ISO 800 both camera has pretty equal image quality but with such bright lens and good IS, you rarely shoot above 800 ISO. Unless you need the extra wide angle or slightly longer range I would choose S95 especially for the low price they offer. I do like the S100's better grip. I ended up taking the S95 home. I wanted to give 4 stars to the S100 but since it is 43% higher than the price of the S95 I give it a 3.Went home and compared S95 vs S90 back to back. Almost identical image quality except S95 has cleaner image processing at the darker areas due to an improve jpg processor. I also like the better ergonomics on the S95 and the price was $100 less than what I paid 1.5 year ago. Other notable improvement that was not mentioned in most reviews was there are more settings for Auto ISO: you can choose a slow ISO increase rate vs normal. In Program mode(P), the normal ISO increase rate was at 1/30' shutter speed, but under slow ISO, the threshold is now 1/15' which is very ideal for still or very slow moving objects in low light. This is just what I needed for the older S90 where under auto ISO setting, the camera wants to choose a much higher ISO than necessary thus produces poorer images, but now I just set it at slow auto ISO and let the camera choose the correct ISO.  I can also set a upper limit in addition to the auto ISO. Most of the other pros & cons are already covered by someone else so I don't need to go over them any more.""

"20111130","5.0","Very good picture resolution , decent performance","First thing, I like the speed. It takes 1 sec to snap and ready for next shutter. Picture resolution and color is very good, you can crop any portion and it is usable . The only annoying thing is the macro distance. Since it can not focus less than 2 inch(some other camera can reach 1/2 inch), you may not get the satisfied result while capturing tiny objects. Other than that it is an excellent point and shoot camera. For best result, try manual mode keeping the ISO at 80... Thanks.""

So I returned my S100 and bought this S95 instead. So far I have used it to take over 1000 images. The image quality is SO IMPRESSIVE!!! I really love this compact camera!!!The only drawback that I can think of is that S95 has a wide-angle of 28mm, which is not as good as S100's 24mm. And it did make a difference. But this is not major. I would hope Canon develop a S105 or some sort of product with impressive image quality delivery as S95 does and the 24mm wide-angle.""

This means, you'll use it more and take more photos.It's point and shoot size but it's no point and shoot camera. It takes SLR quality photos. The lens is incredible. The only downside, is if you plan to put it in auto and just shoot, not every photos is going to be perfect. You need to learn how to adjust setting based on your environment and the subject. Having said that, auto is still pretty incredible. If you want to maximise on this cameras potential, spend some time learning how to use it. You will never regret it, especially at this price. I paid almost $500 for it when it first came out.""
"20111119","5.0","RAW processing","I primarily shoot on a Nikon D700, but I wanted something smaller for casual shots.  I also wanted to experiment with video.The most appealing thing about this camera, to me at least, is raw processing so I can tune exposure, white balance, color calibration, and noise-reduction myself.  I rather not fidget with scene modes and such.  Also, the sensor is quite a bit bigger than most normal point and shoots.  It also has decent video, which is one of the main reasons i picked this up.  f/2 is nice as well.The s95 works similar to a DSLR, with Av, Tv, and M modes and spinning dials for adjusting things like aperture, iso, shutter speed, and even manual focus.  I really liked that.  As an aside, beware that AUTO mode is only in JPG, so even if your settings say RAW it will shoot jpg.  I've just learned to avoid Auto.For video, the s95 shoots 720p / 24fps.  Focus cannot be changed once you start recording.  But, the exposure and white balance will shift according to the scene.  You can fix both white balance and exposure before recording however.  I like to apply some software stabilization in post, which results in a slightly cropped video.  For that reason, the competing s100 (which shoots at 1080p) might be better.  Also, I believe the s100 can autofocus during video.  Either way, focusing isn't a big issue sinse the depth of field on these point and shoots are so deep anyways.  The S100 also has a 15% wider field of view at 24mm vs 28mm on the s95.The S100 is out now, so you might consider getting that too.  I got an s95 though since the image quality is about the same with the s100.  Early reports on dpreview.com even indicate the s95 has better image quality than the s100.  The fact is, if you are serious about imagery, you should just get a micro 4/3rd like the Panasonic GF3, NEX, or just go for a Nikon D7100 or something similar.  Currently, the S100 is about 50% pricier than the S95... so you have to ask yourself if that's worth the slight improvement in image to you.  For me, I'm recognizing that I've made a decision here to lose IQ for pocketability.  And when I really want good IQ, I'll use a bigger camera.  So to me, it wasn't worth it to pay a 50% premium for minimally better IQ with the s100.  Either way, you can't really go wrong.""
"20111118","4.0","Not bad for a compact camera","First I would like to say that this is a compact camera and I knew pretty much what I was in for. My needs on this purchase included: something small, and easy to carry around and good quality images (I am a studio art major and in some conditions I need to take some good shots of a class' still life _that I cannot obviously  take home with me_ or some of my own paintings to post up on the web). In addition I wanted a camera that I could take with me when I go out at night with some friends: the ability to take pics in dim light was not exactly a primary need but it wouldn't hurt to have it as well. My price range was around 300 dollars, but if anything stood out I wouldn't mind to make some compromise for amazing features.That being said, I narrowed my search between the LX5 and S95. Being paranoid of buying such an expensive item through the internet i read multiple reviews before I made up my mind on the latter. Though the LX5 was judged to capture blown away images, I felt uneasy about its size and lens cap (I should add that I also had a military ball to attend in a few days, and I needed to make sure that this camera could fit in my clutch!). I am not exactly a photo enthusiast, and I knew that the default setting and jpeg images was what i was gonna use for a while, before i took time to learn more. Although the S95 would not match the LX5's RAW shots, the jpegs were supposed to.This is what I can say so far from my experience:-Not too impressed by the image stabilization. If your hand is not steady enough, count your shots to be blurry (the LX5 is supposed to be better at that).-More grainy than I would expect, for my certain zoomed pics (but hey, it is a compact camera after all, and for my normal shots, the pics were pretty good. The LX5 blocky lens probably come to better use for that)-Worked pretty great in low light (the ball was held in pretty dark rooms to create ambiance and there, at least, the S95 held on its own)-Fit nicely inside the small purse along with my numerous items, and its compact design overall is pretty nice ( not that it is quite that important but its a nice bonus)-Images' color in normal don't seem to quite match the actual setting, but still pretty closeOverall not too bad... Im sure as I learned more its manual control, its worth would be even closer to how much I spend for it! Im not sure if I would have still chosen over the LX5  had I had a chance to have a hand held experience (for some reason even best buy doesn't hold it in display...). But I am not too disappointed for what it is: A transportable-easy compact camera with good/satisfying images :)""

What follows are general impressions from someone who shoots for fun, but seriously, and expects his camera to be able to perform to the vision in his head.First, the body of the camera is great. As others have said the grip is a little funky sometimes because your hand just doesn't want to quite stay where it's supposed to, but the finish on the paint helps alleviate that. The shutter button is easy to find without looking in it's recessed little area within the zoom knob, and the half-press is responsive to the touch. The scroll wheel on the back is lovely, with just enough grab at intervals to click into place without being over controlling or too loose, as was the case with the s90. I absolutely love the wheel on the front that surrounds the lens; because I shoot mostly in Av mode I can adjust the aperture on the fly with one hand and the ISO via the shortcut button and wheel on the back almost instantaneously, not to mention the satisfyingly old-school clicking it makes.Two body complaintsOne: If you are holding the camera with both hands, you may be surprised by the flash which is motorized straight up out of the body and will most likely be impeded by your finger. The solution, of course, is to avoid the flash as much as possible simply out of the problems of on-camera flash.Two: The mode selection wheel can be a little tricky, especially if trying to go in/out of movie mode which has a large gap between itself and the nearest manual mode, because it is rather recessed into the body and stiff to begin with. Except under the most perfect conditions I have to use m fingernail to turn it, which is more or less an inconvenience.Performance is what I really came here to talk about. There are plenty of reviews that rave over the great photos that come out of this camera, and they're all very true. What bothered me however was the intense barrel distortion that came out of the 6m wide-end of the lens. I first noticed it in my architectural pictures around Paris, where none of the features quite lined up right, and as time went on it started to drive me crazy. I started either using the barreling artistically as a slight fisheye lens or zooming to an (almost 50mm) 49mm equivalent, which kicks my max aperture to f/3.2, nullifying the beautiful f/2.0 real max aperture.After some research, I found CHDK, a program that non-invasively allows you to squeeze that extra bit from your Canon point-and-shoot. The s95 has many of the CHDK functions built-in, but one interesting discovery was the ability to write RAW files as DNG (Digital NeGative) files. When I shot a few DNGs at 6mm and viewed them on my computer, the barreling was absolutely horrendous. I discovered that the s95 does quite a bit of barrel distortion correction when writing JPGs to memory, though evidently not enough. The fix? Lightroom, my editing program of choice, has support for the Canon s95 starting at version 3.4 which allows one to apply lens-specific calibrations to any photo. In order to use this you must shoot in the default RAW mode, which involves more memory and time to write to the card when shooting, but the correction is absolutely unbelievable, and even editable after the calibration default is applied. Moreover, the noise correction that one can apply to RAW files in LR3 is far superior to the in-camera processing, with much smoother textures and crisper detail resolution.For this reason I give it a 4; if Lightroom is out of reach for you (student discount anyone?) or if CHDK is incomprehensible (which it shouldn't be with some work), then the camera performs great in and of itself. If you have these tools it is nearly perfect, with support for scripting via CHDK and much clearer high-ISO shots thanks to LR3 and RAW. It definitely beats lugging my dSLR around pickpocket-infested tourist locations just to get a unique photo.""
"20111115","5.0","Better than the s100!","I purchased the S100 and was not pleased with the image quality...looks like they tried to improve what was not broken.  Returned it and purchased the S95, love it!""
"20111115","5.0","Powerful little camera!!!","Great camera with features of a full on DSLR that fits in your pocket.  But looks like the S100 might take the cake with a wider lens and zoom option when in video mode.  Overall definetely recommend, especially at 329$!!""
"20111112","2.0","OK pictures, flash is unnerving and overflashes, strap is idiotic","I find that this camera takes the same type / quality pictures as my SD970 and SD850 did when they were new.  I was really hoping for the vibrant pictures I see other cameras get.  It does take flash pictures much, much faster than the SD970, but unfortunately they are all way overflashed.  The pop-up flash is completely unnerving, as it pops up right where you hold the camera, and puts me on edge when I use it -- instead of concentrating on the shot, I concentrate on making sure I'm very delicately holding the camera away from the flash.  Even then it still gets me and I jerk, often messing up the picture.  The other thing I completely don't understand is the included strap.  The S95, like the SD970, come with a strap that doesn't have the slider clip to keep it securely on your wrist, so the camera just falls right off, and I had to re-use the normal one from the SD850.""
"20111111","5.0","Great camera!","I love this camera!  Our organization bought it for use at our programs - we wanted a high-quality camera that would take great pictures, even indoors or in lower-light situations, but we didn't want to invest all the way in an SLR, especially since that would mean a learning curve for most of our staff and volunteers.  This camera is the top-of-the-line for a point-and-shoot.  Picture quality is great, especially when shooting in RAW.  I love the option to shoot in RAW and JPEG simultaneously - this allows me to quickly run through all the average pictures, then use the RAW format to make a great picture even better.  I also love the control ring on the front of the camera around the lens.  You can program it to control all sorts of different aspects of the picture-taking for instant adjustments without running through a menu.  Overall, it's an excellent camera, well worth the higher price.  If there were one thing I would wish for, it would be a longer zoom.  It feels pretty short.""
"20111029","2.0","Poor chromatic aberration","I purchased, and subsequently returned, this camera because the chromatic aberration in the RAW file was significantly worse than any camera (point and shoot or DLSR) I've ever used. CA is always present, especially in high contrast scenes, but the S95 produced images that required heavy reduction in Adobe Camera Raw. I've never had to use CA reduction to that extent before.The JPG produced a much cleaner image, but of course, I bought this camera because it can shoot RAW. Otherwise, I quite liked it.""
"20111028","5.0","Good camera for a back yard photographer","This is a great camera.  The biggest curve is the rechargeable battery.  I was used to throwing a couple AA's intro my old Canon.  But the battery has held the charge nicely with my usage rate.  There are features yet to be discovered.  The ease of use, transferring to my 'puter, and the quality of photos--I was way over due for a new point and shoot.""
"20111025","4.0","Great pics - except with flash!!","I love this camera for daylight/lowlight conditions - beautiful colors, good low-light performance, and the image stabilization is great.  However, when the flash is used (in Auto mode), there is a strange bright yellow tint cast on everything!  Maybe this particular camera is defective, I don't know of other similar complaints for this model.  But it is a serious yellow tint - and hair highlights turn bright yellow.""
"20111024","5.0","You need to buy this camera!","This is probably the best camera I have ever used. The picture quality is AMAZING! The camera captures colors that are rich and intense. I also took a picture in a dark room and it captured the entire space perfectly. There were no dark shadows or grainy areas.""
"20111023","3.0","Little less than what i expected","I was looking for a Point and Shoot camera with good shutter response to take pics of my kid. After reviewing lots of camera online, finally settled on S95. The photos are crisp, focus is quick on half press, but the shutter lag is a let down. Probably I was trying to find features of a DSLR in a PoS and surely failed in that. Will probably buy a D3100 soon.Quality of videos from S95 are little inferior to those from flip, so i still use flip to shoot videos mostly.""
"20111023","5.0","Incredible camera, and so far, so good.","Wonderful wide-angle shots... incredible low-light performance for a compact (thanks to the huge sensor)... and the best white balance (color) in the industry.I had an S90 (this camera's predecessor) which ended up having 4 serious but noncritical problems within 18 months.  I used it a lot, but I also took good care of it.  It was my 4th digital camera from Canon, and it had far more problems than any other Canon I'd owned (dark spot on lens; flash state issue; loose battery connection issue; and PC connection issues).  But that was the S90.I've now had the S95 for 3 weeks and shot many photos with it, and I'm very impressed.  No issues so far, but the picture quality is stunning, and the startup time and shot-to-shot time (when you turn review off) are incredible - something like 5 frames per second.I actually intentionally bought the S95 rather than waiting a few more weeks for the newer/better S100 to come out.  Why?  Because this camera tries to pack SO MANY physical features into such a tiny package.  My theory is that that's why my S90 had so many problems.  Notice that the S90 and S95 are almost identical cameras, spec-wise; so why bother updating it?  I think it's because they worked out a lot of those kinks.Then along comes the S100, with an even wider-angle lens and better telephoto.  No thanks!  I don't want more problems... I'll wait for a revision on the S100, after they work out the kinks.  I think the S95 is the best thing for now.But I'll be sure to post here if I have problems with it.""
"20111020","3.0","A Super Camera--Until the Lens Jammed","I have simply loved this camera since I got it 4 months ago--until today, when the infamous 'Lens Error' message came up, indicating that the zoom mechanism was jammed, making the camera inoperable.  Canon tried to fix it over the phone to no avail, so now its in the mail for Canon to fix or replace under warranty.Picture-wise, this camera is just super. It's way better for my purposes than the other two Canons I've owned: the S3IS and the SX20IS. I get much better low-light pictures with this little gem than with either of the others. I attribute that to the f2.0 lens on this little guy. This camera has a 4x zoom, much less than the megazoom of the other cameras, but I didn't mind giving up the zoom to get the low-light performance. I had looked for other cameras that would give me a big lens, and it seemed like the only ones that would do better than the S95 were big expensive digital SLR's.Did I mention that this is a true pocketable camera? When I got it, I put it in my pocket, and it stayed there until today, unless I was actually taking pictures with it.About that 'Lens Error:'  The reason that I don't have that S3IS any more is that it, too, suffered the infamous 'Lens Error.' That was after almost 5 years of service, so I figured I'd gotten good service out of it and got the S95. I had hoped for at least 5 years out of this one, but it failed after only 4 months.  And no, I didn't get sand or water in it, or drop it, or bump it, or do anything else to it--other than carry it around in my pocket (which is what a pocket camera is for, right?).""
"20111018","5.0","So far so good...","I bought a canon 230HS but I was not satisfied with the IQ at low lights. Then I bought the S95, with the understanding that I am sacrificing optical zoom (3.8x for S95 vs 10+x for 230HS) for the IQ. Let me tell you this, I don't regret the decision at all. The low light and very low light images are EXCEPTIONAL. Pretty pleased. The only concern I have, about the camera in general, is that I believe the flash will have issues in the future (same comment about 230HS). I believe the reason for my worry is the design of the flash in the camera. Other than that, I am extremely pleased with S95.""
"20111018","5.0","Image excellence!","This camera is hands down the best camera I have ever owned-35mm SLR and digital.  I purchased the camera right before a trip to Seattle.  I left it in full auto mode the entire time.  The quality of every image is outstanding-color, exposure, and focus.""
"20111017","5.0","Buy it!","I have been using the camera for about 7 months now and the overall feel and quality of the camera is superb. All the controls are straight forward and easy to use. The buttons are easy to see and are solid to the touch. The control dial on the backside of the camera is enjoyable to use as well. The battery life is good enough for plenty of pictures and a decent amount of video. If you charge the battery only when it needs it, it should last a while. As of right now, this camera is awesome and is working fine. It feels so solid in your hands and really takes amazing photos. Huge assortment of customizable options to choose from to tweek pictures. Definitely a buy!And for all the 'lens error' problems, i really dont see that happening unless some serious damage is done to the lens itself.""
"20111016","5.0","Excellent pocket camera","This is an excellent pocketable camera. Photos are vivid, sharp and show good dynamic range.The camera is very logicial in its operations and best of all takes really usable pictures in low light conditions at ISO levels up to 1,600, even though the camera can push to 3,200. The lens is very fast F 2.0.The camera competes in bright light with my Canon 40D SLR. Low light picture quality is not as competitive but still very natural and useable, unlike some of my other pocket cameras.This is the small camera for the serious SLR photographer to use when an SLR is not practical. Highly recommended.""

"20110930","4.0","One annoying flaw.","You read all the other rave reviews, I'm not going to debate them because they're all correct. Picture quality is A_MAY_ZING.One stand out flaw: I hold point and shoots of this size with my left hand mirroring my right hand. That is, holding the side of the camera in my palm with my pointer finger curling over the top left corner of the camera - which  is right where the flash pops out. Many times it's spooked me enough to cause me to almost drop the camera and every time I worry I'm going to break the little servo motor that pushes the flash up and down. Incorporate the flash into the body please, I'm willing to sacrifice size for that.One stand out feature: the manual ring function. AWESOME! I do a lot of depth of field adjustments, BOOOM! no stupid menus and bleeping and blooping, the aperture adjustment is just a satisfying click around the dial. I would love to see this expanded on a future model with multiple rings (or one ring and an A/B/C switch) so I can 'click' adjust the aperture, 'click' adjust the shutter speed and 'click' adjust the white balance with three quick and easy twists of the dial.Firmware menus suck. Dials, toggles and switches rule!!!So close to perfect Canon, so close.....""
"20110925","5.0","Excellent portable high quality camera - but exposure can not be changed in Auto mode","Excellent little camera and extremely portable. Makes excellent pictures. Has almost the same features as the G12. Takes very good pictures at low light. Auto mode works very well. Also takes very good underwater pictures when combined with the Canon underwater case. My only complaint is that you can not modify exposure settings when in auto mode. You can do that on other Canons. So if you need to change exposure (sometimes Auto mode does not get it right) you need to go in P mode where you have all the options of a high quality camera.""
"20110915","4.0","Overall great camera but definitely loses 1 star for the placement of the flash","I read numerous reviews on this camera and read about the flash problem in that you usually put your finger where the flash comes out of the body in the upper left corner (when looking at the screen. I thought that it wouldn't be a big deal and it isn't for my family because we know not to put our finger there. The problem is when you have other people take your picture; they almost always jam the flash which over time will break the flash mechanism.You might wonder why I would still give 4 stars but the picture quality is amazing. The picture quality rivals my Canon SLR 50D. The low light pictures are what really amaze me because of the warmth of the colors. I decided to buy this camera as an SLR replacement because I was tired of lugging around another bag which almost feels like another carry on for all of our trips. I was also getting tired of lugging the SLR to parties or other events and would just leave it at home. Well, it doesn't do you any good if you want to take a picture and you don't have your camera with you. I looked at a few SLR replacements like the Nikon P6000 but in terms of value and picture quality, I decided on the Canon S95 and have been very happy with the purchase!""

It's small, easy to use, but most importantly, it takes great pictures, particularly in low light conditions.  Other review go into the technical aspects of it; from a user's perspective, it has all the features I've come to expect from this line of Canon cameras, and it takes very nice sharp pictures.  Battery life has been fantastic, coupled with an 8gb card this camera can seemingly go forever.  The only two issues I've noticed in several months of regular use is (1) sometimes in video mode, it seems to have trouble focusing-- if it doesn't find a focus right away, the only way to correct is to stop and start again; and (2) sometimes in portrait mode / low light conditions the flash fails to engage.  Both have happened to me a few times, but these seem to be intermittent issues, and really haven't been more than an occasional annoyance.

This is a great camera for its size, but those of you saying it is going to replace your DSLR are sadly mistaken.  It is nowhere near DSLR image quality.With that said, it is a very nice camera that can be taken anywhere.  And the image quality is just good enough to get you by when you don't want to lug your DSLR around.  We love ours and take it on family outings or local trips.

"20120501","5.0","Awesome pictures!","This camera is worth the money. It takes amazing shots and is easy to use, even with all the advanced settings. I've owned Koadak's and Panasonic's, but Canon digital cameras always take the best pictures.""
"20120426","1.0","Lens Error","Absolutely amazing picture quality, this was the first camera that I've ever owned that I truly loved. It takes gorgeous pictures, is incredibly compact, and feels very well engineered in the hand. Downside - I encountered the dreaded 'lens error' issue when the lens jammed as it tried to retract into the case when I powered it down. I had an extended warranty that refunded my purchase price on it. I'll likely buy the S100 now but I'm concerned because I see that it also has a ton of 'lens error' issues being reported. I might just hold out for the LX5 successor instead... but I really did love this camera while it was functional.""

"20120421","5.0","My favorite camera","I love this camera more than I can express. What amazing pictures it takes!!! I use it more than my big fancy digital SLR. Canon has great picture quality, and this camera is no exception. I have not had any quirks or problems with it at all, even taking it to Brazil and South Africa within 4 month of purchasing it. It is unbeatable for the size and the price. My only complaint is that it is hard to get a good hold of, because of the small and square nature of the design. I just bought a Richard Franiec custom grip, and it has solved the problem. Totally worth it for this camera. It's portable and easy to use. Amazing, amazing, amazing.""
"20120421","3.0","Love it . . . BUT","I love this camera. It takes some gorgeous pictures. I usually shoot with a very expensive DSLR but needed a small point and shoot to take with me when I go hiking or on a bike ride. I've tried many different cameras but this one takes the clearest pictures. I've posted some of my pictures above for you to see for yourself. However (and this is a big one), I have been getting the dreaded 'lens error' and the camera will just shut off. This lens error makes it so that I can not zoom - AT ALL. As a semi-professional photographer, I know that zooming isn't the best thing to do anyway. So, I move closer whenever possible. But, there are times when I wish I could get closer with the zoom and I can not. If the camera is asked to move the lens in any way (other than to turn on or off), It will give an error message and it will shut off. The camera does work when I turn it back on, but I really don't know how long I have before my beloved camera will never turn on again.Now you can use this information to make an informed decision. Get a great camera and takes some great pictures. But be forewarned, you may have problems with your lens.""
"20120412","4.0","Better than the S100","I had the Canon S95 prior to buying my S100.  I loved the S95 and sold it right after getting the S100, figuring the S100 would be a superior camera. I think the photo quality is slightly better with the S95.  The S100 photo quality is still excellent, and has some some features that I'd use once in a rare while, like high framerate photography.  I thought the GPS would be useful for geotagging photos when I upload them to facebook, but I can rarely get a GPS signal, and when I have the GPS on the battery drains really fast.  If you can pick up a S95 for $100+ cheaper than the S100, I encourage you to do so.""

"20110815","5.0","Its a Super Pseudo SLR.","Great Stuff. All I have to say, is that canon should just eliminate most of the auto functions such as the various scenes like underwater, low light, tilt shift etc and just leave the Full manual control along with the auto focus. That's the main reason I bought this camera. If you want an auto function camera, then gets something else, there's a ton of them for a lot less. Besides that, No complain here. Its like a SLR without the zoom and the size. I never use the auto features, except the auto focus. If you want HDR Photos, all you need is a tripod and Photomatrix. The HDR auto function on this camera is a joke. It reduces the image to a 2.5MB JPEG file and it only takes three shots in different exposure which is very limiting. I only use the manual setting with the auto focus, auto tracking, focus lock, and occasionally, the AI servo feature. 10MPix is more than enough for prints, the 28mm lens is not so much a problem, because I always runs my photos through Photoshop before making a print and photo-stitch along with lens correction sometimes fixes the wide angle issue. And as you know, Photoshop can recreate all the auto scene effects that are produced with this camera and I see no reason to load it in because I never made a direct print from camera to printer without doing some photo corrections.Besides having the auto mode, its not a loss and still remains a top notch slim down camera with an SLR power.""
"20110812","5.0","Wide Angle is NOT Wide Angle, but I still love this camera!","In my quest for the perfect point & shoot for me, I purchased the S95. I also own the Sony HX5v, the Sony HX9v, and the Canon S80.I had the Canon SX210, which I loved except, sold it because the video was weaker (not HD)than I wanted it to be.My problem with the S95 is that it really does not have a good wide angle. I know the spec's say it does a 28mm, but it does not do a good wide angle and does not even perform like the S80 in wide angle.I take my camera's out with me and take pictures. I wanted to take a couple of pictures of a Nissan dealership in Washington the other day, and the S95 was unable to get the complete bldg in the picture, or even half of the bldg., as did the HX5v and the S80. Am I going to sell the S95?,  No, I love this camera. The size, the picture quality, and the performance is great except for that issue. The video (HD)is not the best in the lot, but it's in the running, and plenty good enough for when I have it out.I really think that most of the complaints on point & shoots are from not knowing how to work the camera's though. Wide angle on the S95 is not a user issue though.For the money, the size, the performance, I would never get rid of the S95, unless I could only have one camera, which is not the case. The S95 runs close with the Panasonic LX5 in pic quality, except that the panasonic probably does wide angle just fine.  I've never been able to play with the panasonic. Other camera's of interest would be the Olympus XZ1 and the Nikon Coolpix P300. But they're alot bigger than the S95. I could easily own the canon SX230, which is the SX210 with HD video and GPS. The S95's wide angle problem is the only thing I can think of that I can really fault it for.""
"20110808","4.0","A worthy companion to a dslr such as the canon 5d Mark II","This review is intended to help someone decide whether to buy a s95, not to decide between buying a 5d or a s95.  Clearly these are very different products, but the s95, or other cameras like it, can potentially provide a useful secondary camera for someone not wanting to lug a 5d and its lenses around all day long.I own a 5d Mark II and a number of L lenses, and was looking for a secondary camera, especially one that was portable, yet offered high image quality.  My challenge is that i'm very picky on image quality, and my initial inclination was that I'd suck it up and continue to use the 5d if I could not get reasonable quality from the s95 or a similar product.  I know the image quality will be vastly different, but the question is whether all things considered (portability, image quality, etc.), would I be happy using the s95 as a backup, or would it severely disappoint me.I took the plunge and bought a S95.  In short, I'm happy, but not ecstatic.  Obviously, there's a big difference in image quality, but its not as big as I expected.  If used in the right conditions (good lighting, artificial or otherwise) with a low ISO setting (400 and under), you'll be very happy with the results.  It may not be appropriate for poster size, but would work well up to 8X10.Video - it does shoot video, and perhaps HD according to some measures.  However, the quality is so so.  This is in comparison with my companion Canon Vixia S100.  Again, unfair to the S95 to make this comparison, but footage is very noisy.  All else seems fine, but the noise is unavoidably there.  Also, unlike conventional camcorders, the S95 does not continuously auto focus on the subject; you have to be very careful to ensure your subject stays within the focus plane.General - if you're a dSLR user, you would buy this camera as a easily portable option.  The size is great, it easily fits in a pant pocket, and you certainly don't experience fatigue by carrying it all day, as you clearly do with a 5d.  You definitely will not see 5d-like image quality, but you will produce extremely usable shots.  Someone once said the best shots are the ones you actually get.  I take that insight to heart, and find myself capturing many more images with this than my 5d simply because its easy to do so.  My 5d is glorious, but the s95 is always there ready to do.Again, my point was to determine whether I could live with the s95 as a backup to my 5d, not to replace my 5d.  Given the pretty decent image quality and superb portability, the answer is yes.Also, i'm rating this a 4/5.  It would be higher if the video quality were stronger.  Irrespective of any comparison to an equally priced or higher product, the video definitely lags.  Its nice for impromptu footage, but that's about it.""

I did have to send it back under warrantee at one point but it has been going strong ever since and I am not taking any stars away for that issue.  The last trip I left the E-510 at home and didn't miss the weight or bulk and I don't feel I missed any photo ops as a result.  Each camera has its place, the S95 I can carry every day and it is not a bother.""
"20110724","5.0","Not for the beginner.","If don't know how to use a camera beyond full auto or go beyond it infrequently, if you don't know how to use RAW files or do but choose not to use them, then you're spending way too much money on this camera.  There are other cameras out there that are cheaper, have more features, have a longer telephoto and better built-in flash than the S95.I wanted a camera that:1.  Can fit in a shirt pocket, not just a cargo pocket.2.  Manual controls3.  RAW output.4.  TelephotoAn optical viewfinder and external flash support would have been nice but the G12 does not fit in a shirt pocket.  Specifically I wanted a camera that I can walk with when I didn't want to or could not lug my DSLR around.This of course comes with compromises.  The small sensor means more noise but you get deeper depth of field, however it's harder to get an out of focus background.  The plus that helps offset this is the 2.0 lens but only at the wide end.  The small size means it's a lot more fiddly to use and handle.  It's slow.  Slow to focus, slow to shoot.  Not that wide at the short end and not a very long tele.But I've been out in my yard taking pictures, happily adjusting shutter speed, f-stops, ISO, exposure compensation, and flash exposure compensation with minimal amount of fuss.  It just takes time to get used to.  This is where we come to the next compromise that Canon made that I'm not really happy about.  This is a camera that needs a full manual to read in the field.  Heck, I still carry the manual for DSLR around with me.  The full manual only comes on the CD.  I can print my own, but those 8x11 sheets of paper are not very compact.The pictures?  For me, they have been very good when used within its limitations.""

"20110719","2.0","Poorly designed, breaks very easily","We had this camera for less than 6 months and it needs to be sent back to Canon to be replaced.  There is a design problem with the flash.  The flash mechanism is located right were your finger is placed when taking a picture.  If your finger inhibits the flash from rising, it breaks the mechanism.  One that happens, the camera is toast.  If you want to see how widespread the problem is, just google 'wrong flash position restart the camera' and look at all of the people having the problem with the s90 and the s95.  We only used the camera a few times and it needs to be replaced.  Junk for such an expensive camera.  I had a panasonic prior to the canon and never had a problem.

"20110718","5.0","Great Camera","I waited quite some time before buying the Canon S95. I have over 40 years of experience in photography with my first camera being a manual Nikon FM, then on to a Nikon FE, F3, Canon EOS 620 etc, all SLR's. With the advent of the digital point & shoot cameras I had a 4MP Olympus Stylus 410, obviously I needed a major upgrade as the Olympus could'nt cut it anymore, especially in low light situations. I looked very closely at Nikon, Olympus, and came close to going with the Panasonic Lumix series with a Leica lense. However, I was intrigued with the Canon S95. Simply put, it is an amazing camera, jamb packed with just about every tool that a novice or pro could want. There is much to read and absorb for learning the capabilities of the S95. The few gripes that I have are that it is quite small for those of us with big hands, but that was part of it's apeal to drop in your pocket on the go. Also, the software supplied from Canon can be somewhat awkward to navigate, but  has much more information about the camera and was not as bad as some here have posted in my opinion. The fast F2 lens makes incredible low light photos and the flexiblity provided by the controls are intuative and well thought out. (love the control ring) Though a bit exspensive it's still well worth it and I highly recommend it for those who want High quality photos and decent video..""

"20110717","5.0","Amazing compact camera","I have been taking outdoor shots for many years. As a travel companion, I could hardly ask for a more applicable, decent little camera then the Canon S95.I actually owned a Canon S90 (previous year's model), which turned out to be my favorite camera for a time. For the curious, check out my site - scenicdesktops.com, just to see the kind of pictures I took with it.The S95 shares everything that made the S90 such a hit, with a few very nice refinements that make it into what I consider to be a close-to-perfect compact camera.The basics which both of these cameras share are:1. Excellent image quality. The sensor in this little camera is roughly twice the size in area of sensors found in most compacts of similar size (meaning pocketable). Combined with a bright lens (f2.0, at it's widest - where I often use it), it produces better highlights (clouds, etc) and shadows over a wide margin then what any of my older compacts could achieve or even get close to.2. Excellent controls. I love canon's approach. The control ring around the lens on the front is likely my favorite feature. Amazingly versitle and simple, it provides fine control over any one setting you choose, such as exposure, white balance, ISO, etc. Selecting the setting is easy, with a ring func button on top, and the control it provides is solid, with smooth operation and nice, audible clicks. A smaller, secondary control ring is placed around the directional pad on the back, which provides further control. A programmable shortcut button on the back simply serves to be assigned whatever function you wish. On the control dial at the top, a custom mode is provided which saves your exact settings to keep you from having to reset everything after turning it off.3. Nice menus. The quick menu (where most of the commonly accessed settings are) is nice, 2-dimensional simplicity, with clear, distinct options, and a layout you won't get lost in. The main 'menu-menu', while more traditional, is also clean, and thankfully not riddled with numerous nested menus.4. Truly compact. The main competitors from Panasonic and Olympus, while noteworthy and with comparable specs, simply do not quite fall into the 'pocketable' realm, with their lenses and other features protruding out enough to disqualify each, imo. The S95 really is a pocketable camera, no doubt about it, and with credible specs to boot.Additionally, the S95 improves and adds upon an already excellent package:1. Improves the rear control dial. The S90's dial was loose and spun freely, whereas the S95 features 'clicks' which prevent accidental movement.2. The S90 had a slippery metal body; the S95 features a surface which is tackier and easier to hold.3. The S95 now offers 720p HD video; the S90 did not.4. The S95 now offers stereo sound with left and right michrophones. Even high end cameras generally lack this.5. The S90 only offered a single lanyard-link on the side; the S95 offers two, both at the top corners. This allows for a neck lanyard if desired.6. New modes such as HDR, as well as a greater range of options for the customizable buttons/rings.7. The S95 is slimmer then the S90 by a notable amount.With that said, it's not a camera that can 'do everything' - mostly because it is a compact, after all. It doesn't feature the huge sensors of large cameras that allow selective focus several feet away (for portraits, etc), or hot shoe mounts, pivoting screens, etc. None of these really belong on a compact. There are a couple minor nitpicks that I can point out. You can't control what the rear control dial does, for example - it defaults to whatever mode your in. You also loose most manual control when in a scene mode. I don't find these to be glaring or problematic, others may.As a side note, a company called Lensmate (no affiliation, promise!) provides worthwhile S90 / S95 accessories, such as a tiny 37mm filter holder that can attach to the front (I use a polarizer), as well as a small attachable grip that I think works perfectly, without compromising pocketability.Considering I would have given the excellent S90 a 5 star rating, the S95 gets this and then some. For someone who likes to travel, hike, and shoot with focus across the frame, this camera is one of those rare items that feels someone must have made just for me.""

It is light-years ahead of the top of the line pocketable cameras of only a few years ago.  If you use the S95 properly (remembering basic rules of thumb for composition, lighting and so forth, and not just banging off ill-considered pics because you happen to have it in your hand) you really will be surprised what it can do.  Very responsive shooting, and the RAW images look great with minimal editing.  While the S95 can never replace my DSLR for versatility and solid results under demanding conditions, in ideal circumstances the S95's pictures sometimes rival the SLR's photos in quality much more closely than I ever would have expected.One thing to note - the ergonomics of holding this tiny camera leaves something to be desired.  Without a built-in grip, it's kind of like holding a dry bar of soap.  I bought an aftermarket solution - Richard Franiec's Custom S95/S90 Grip (search for it), and it really did wonders for the feel of the unit.  Much more comfortable, and I feel much less likely to lose proper grip or drop it outright.""

The only thing we noticed was sometimes between shots the load time was a little annoying, we believe this may be some what due to the memory card though. Also, the pop up flash is really cool, but it kept surprising me. You will get use to it, but remember to remind people who are taking your picture with it, or they will drop your $400 camera.The different scenes are really cool for all types of situations, we found ourselves mainly using the auto mode as we didn't have time to stop and think a lot about settings etc. Another cool feature is the ability for the camera to shoot raw photos. From what I've seen out of this camera I would say it definitely is the best point and shoot out there, but also will rival getting a DSLR for the weekend warrior photographer.One quality issue, the case has a slight 'creek' on it when you squeeze in one spot, not a big deal, but kind of annoying for a $400 camera, you would expect a very high quality build.

"20110708","5.0","Excellent small camera for a range of users","I am a life-long photo hobbyist with a couple of high-end Nikon DSLR and SLR cameras and a dozen Nikkor lenses, so I have clearly tried to spend my way to good pictures.  My primary subjects are fast moving grandsons.BUT, it has always been a pain to lug that stuff around, and I find myself less and less willing to deal with all the weight, bulk and possible theft issues.So I bought the S95 'for my wife'; she loves it but I use it too and I think the fact that it's useful to both of us is really amazing.  She wants to point and shoot and to plug it straight into a PICT Bridge printer.  This cameral does all this very well, as others have noted.What amazes me about the S95 is how useful I find it... the lens is pretty fast and the colors are excellent to my eye.  The manual controls are easily learned; focusing is reasonably fast in most circumstances and the focus ring is very useful.The size is amazing and since 'the best camera is the one you have with you' I get good photos in what would otherwise be 'cell phone or nothing' situations.I thought it was a good value when I bought it; it's nearly $100 cheaper today.The only negative is that there isn't a lot of room for my big hands but that's not Canon's fault.I really don't see how you can go wrong with this camera.""

Image quality is excellent, and the camera features a full range of settings, which can be at times, a bit confusing. Focus seems to be a bit of an issue, but once you become accustomed to the camera, it gets easier to get perfectly focused shots. The lens control ring is an interesting addition to this camera, and quite functional. Great camera overall - you will This is a nice update from Canon. It's much smaller than the G series, with many of the same features, and is a big move up from the normal Powershot line. The camera has GREAT low-light capability, and is durable and solid.""
"20110706","5.0","the best","I'm no Pulitzer Prize winning photographer and dont pretend to be, but this camera is awesome for the average amateur photographer who wants something light and easy to use and can take excellent pictures.  I got this for my wife for Christmas and we absolutley love this camera.  There is nothing worse than carrying around your kid(s) and then having to lug around a huge DSLR camera with the bag and lenses, etc...  I wanted something light that could fit in your pocket and this camera fits the bill perfectly.  We love playing around with all the features and our friends always comment on the quality of our pics.  The only downside is the price, but now that we have had it 6 months I would buy it again in a heartbeat.""
"20110704","5.0","Bought it after 4 months with Panasonic TZ10","The review refers mostly for use in auto mode in both s95 and TZ10 and low light in s95 (TZ10 does not have a low light mode). Also note that I did not buy both  cameras from Amazon.I purchased a brand new: Panasonic TZ10 base on the good reviews of the TZ serie. The results were and still very good in day light and the video is really amazing for a compact camera and the zoom is remarkable. But Indoor, the image quality was not enough for me and after struggling with it for few months I gave up and decided to look somewhere else.So, after a quick research, I decided to give the Canon s95 or the Canon G12 a try -  the s95 won for the compactness.Compared to the TZ10 the S95 is smaller and it really slips into pockets easily.The image quality with the S95 is great under any light conditions and superb in good light conditions. In low light you need to change to low light mode. Finally, I solved my low light problems. The zoom of course is not as the TZ10 so when I need large zoom usually outside in day light -  I use the TZ10.With a little more zoom (also in video mode) - the s95 can be realy the perfect P&S for me.The s95 is more expensive than the TZ10.By the way, In my opinion, the images from the Canon looks better, but the Panasonic image colors are much closer to reality.""

The camera arrived, I followed all of the instructions and kept getting a 'lens error' message.  After spending too much time researching this in the 'getting started' book, the on-line 'how-to' CD and online with Canon tech support, I decided to return the camera.  The process was fairly easy but...I had to pay for the return shipping and insurance which was $14!!  It was free shipping to get to me!!  I was never able to take a picture!  I got another Canon S95 camera from a local Best Buy for same price - no shipping fees and have been happily taking pictures ever since.""
"20110704","3.0","Why no viewfinder?!","I HAD to have this camera when it came out. I upgraded from an older point and shoot and moved to Canon from Nikon just to get the RAW and the easily adjustable aperture - since I love having a camera in my pocket when I travel on business - and not having to carry the D300 I use when I'm a tourist......But just try getting a good picture in the full sun when it is glaring off the screen! Unfortunately this isn't only about this camera as viewfinders on point and shoot cameras have essentially gone extinct. But on a camera like this - and for its likely target audience - it should have a viewfinder.Other than that - it is a nice camera and takes good pictures - but if you are really just using it as a point and shoot on Auto, the lens is a bit short for the price. And fortunately (knocking on wood here), I have not had any of the 'shut down' issues that I have seen in other reviews......""

This camera has all the manual controls that one needs. It also shoots in RAW, which is a huge plus. The quality is the best I've seen in this type of camera. My only complaint is that the battery life is rather short. Do yourself a favor and order an extra battery with the camera.""

The Vivid feature under Scene really makes landscape images 'pop'.  Still learning all the features that will work so well.  The hand strap can be placed on either sider of the camera - nice feature.  The HD movie was beyond my expectations - most excellent.Disappointments - no viewfinder but the screen is very good.  No printed manual - if you spend $400 for a camera, I expect a manual.  Printing parts and cutting it to size were a pain.  The power on button is a little small.Overall - love it - great camera""
"20110625","4.0","Great camera, but you'll want more","I must first start this review off by saying that this is an awesome camera.  However, this camera will make you want more.It's very conveniently sized and you can virtually take it anywhere.  Even though I own an SLR, I will still use this camera as an everyday carry item when an SLR is not feasible to tote around since they aren't exactly known for their small size.  The aperture stops down to f/2.0 which is great for taking pictures in dark areas, which is rare for a camera this small.Though it has many things going for it, it does have its shortcomings.  The manual controls are pretty limited.  Even the though the camera can stop down to f/2.0, it only goes up to f/8.0 on the other end which doesn't make much of a difference in the depth of field department.  Also, as with any camera this size, it handles higher ISO's fairly poorly.  Personally, I think that after you hit about 300~400 ISO, the pictures start to become hard to look at which will definitely limit your options.  I've also noticed that the front glass gets dirty very quickly, and because it's so small, it's damn near impossible to clean.  Another thing I've noticed is that this camera is kind of fragile.  Though the build quality is great and feels solid, don't expect it to take any kind of drop or rough treatment.  One random thing that I've noticed with it is that right out of the box, this camera smells really bad.  It airs out in about a week though.All in all, this camera is recommended, but if you're looking to buy it for its manual control, just use the $400 to get yourself an SLR.""

I'm very happy with the purchase and glad I bought it here on Amazon - no sales tax and shipped very quickly (I have Prime).  Highly recommended!""
"20110622","5.0","A small problem","The camera is awesome, but be careful when you buy it from QUALITYPHOTO.The S95 they are selling is a gray market good and so you will get a chinese outlet plug for your charger.

"20110620","5.0","Small package, Big features","I read tons of reviews and was on the fence about buying the S95 because I didn't think I would use all the features, I bit the bullet and purchased it. The S95 does have an impressive feature set and it will satisfy novice and pro photographers alike. If you are looking for SLR performance in a point and shoot package this is the camera to buy.Over all it takes very good photos, with little noise. It handles indoor shots with different kinds of lighting very well, outdoor shots are beautiful and the colors are vibrant. I am very satisfied with the S95 and use it now more than my Canon 40D for casual and some more professional settings.""

"20110619","5.0","It's no secret: a top-notch camera","I'm not experienced with SLR cameras, but I wouldn't consider myself a novice with point and shoots. After doing much research on the best P+S cameras, I, like many others, boiled down the search to two: the Panasonic Lumix LX5 and the Canon PowerShot S95. By now there were many sites with articles comparing the two. In the end, I decided that the S95's significantly smaller, pocketable size was the dealbreaker. I had to sacrifice a wider lens (24 mm vs 28 mm on the S95) and shooting speed (6 fps vs 1.9* fps on the S95), not to mention the sexy Leica-branded lens (seriously!) but I decided that the more optimal size and low light performance of the S95 was worth it.So far I've brought it nearly everywhere, even to work since it is so pocketable. Note that it's still significantly larger than entry-level P+S cameras.PROS (notable ones I've picker out):+Gorgeous, razor sharp LCD screen+Control wheel, in addition to the rear dial, makes setting options much faster+Great image quality, with sharpness nearing SLR's+Built-in HDR mode is awesome for scenic photos+Simplistic, classy design+Very good low-light performance: ISO 3200 can make a room illuminated only by a monitor seem like it's taken during day (noisy though, but the colors were there) See pics.CONS (Improvements I'd like to see):-Pop up flash is very annoying, that's where my left index finger rests!-Aperture is pretty bad when fully zoomed in, at f/4.9 (though the lens is quite fast at the wide end at f/2.0)-Shooting speed could be better-Optical zoom could be better (only 3.8x)Conclusion: This is one of the best P+S cameras available with today's technology. Very soon the gap between P+S and SLR cameras will be bridged, though there are always factors such as optical zoom and depth of field that can only be improved so much due to physical limitations of a pocket camera.*You can use the low-light mode during day time, which shoots about 4 fps but at 2.5 MP size""
"20110616","5.0","Perfection with qualifications","The Canon S95 takes stunning pictures that are way beyond my expectations, just like most other owners have reported.  In the basic mode I use, I simply can't believe how good the picture look.  I take a lot of landscapes, gardens, street scenes and detail closeups and am strictly amateur.I could gush all day, but people are probably more interested in the few flaws I can perceive at my non-professional level. First is the instructions, which are only available on a disk.  This camera is fortunately fairly intuitive but to use any of the higher features you need to be reading the manual which I'm not willing to print out and lug everywhere.  I also don't like that they use vocabulary appropriate for professional/advanced photographers, who wouldn't need to use the manual much anyway.  Ultimately, I may or may not advance beyond the basic level.The camera tends to make things very colorful, which I happen to like, but when adjusting the pics (very few need adjusting compared with my old old Olympus digital) I once in a while have to turn the color saturation down.  I'd rather have it be this way than have the pics come out too drab.  I'm amazed at the quality of pics I can get outdoors in the middle of the day under blazing sun.Speaking of adjusting pics, I am very pleased with the Digital Photo Professional editing program that comes with the camera.  You can resize, tilt, adjust all aspects of color, hue, contrast, sharpness, etc.  I'm not interested in the complications of Photo Shop and there's really no need.  In fact, I frequently find after diddling with the adjustments I prefer the shot exactly as the camera took it.  Probably the most common adjustment I make after re-sizing and cropping is to up the contrast on overcast outdoor shots a small tick or two.One reason I chose this model is because you can set it to focus manually.  I thought I needed this because my old camera took so many out-of-focus shots and there was no manual focus.  The S95 is so good with focus, I never even bother with the manual focus.  The viewfinder shows you what the camera is focusing on, and if that's not what you want, you just half-depress the shutter button again for a different focus option.  Very cool.  Even in non-macro mode, and without a tripod, I get very close up shots of flowers that are startling in their clear detail when blown up.Some have said the camera body is slippery or flimsy.  I think it feels very substantial for something so small, and the grip feels quite secure.  Of course, you need to get used to how to hold it.Others have rightly said that a LCD viewfinder is impossible to use outdoors on a very bright day.  I did get used to not looking through a real viewfinder pretty quickly, but the LCD screen on this camera requires an act of faith when shooting on a bright sunny day.  Have to say that usually the faith is rewarded.  I can't say much that's helpful about indoor shots, because I don't take many, but when I do they look fine.  Outdoor shots at twilight are very beautiful.  I don't use the video mode.For my last nit-pick, I signed up for the Emails to customers, and have been pretty disappointed.  I was hoping for good tips and info about using the camera better.  Instead, it's just routine marketing.  Well, maybe with a camera this good they can coast on the non-essential stuff.  I'd buy this camera again in an instant and be grateful for the opportunity.""

"20110614","5.0","Amazing!","This is the most amazing camera ever! I havent scratched the surface of all its capabilities but I love it already!!""
"20110612","5.0","LOVE THIS CAMERA!!","I haven't taken pictures for almost twenty years but at that time I was a professional freelance photographer. I really wasn't sure I'd be able to enjoy and use a digital camera the way I did my old Canon F-1--figured that it would take too long to learn how to use it and that I wouldn't be able to do the sort of abstract, creative photography that I prefer.I've only been using the Canon S95 for less than a month and already I'm taking the same quality macro shots that I use to with my old 35mm. I've hardly used the  Auto modes at all, choosing instead to use the AV, (aperture priority), mode for my close-ups.Initially I was concerned that not having a viewfinder would be a stumbling block but I so much prefer standing back and composing the picture on the LCD screen that I don't think I would use the viewfinder if it had one. (My eyes don't focus close up like they use to and constantly cranking my neck to squint into a viewfinder use to get painful if I was doing a lot of shooting--especially if I was shooting at a low angle with the camera on a tripod.)I considered getting a DLSR but honestly one thing I never liked about my old F-1 was lugging around all that equipment--lenses, filters, huge tripod, etc.For my S95 I did buy a good small tripod which I pretty much use all the time when shooting macro--but that doesn't weigh me down at all. At some point I may get a DSLR but so far I don't feel like I'm missing anything and the fact that I can just walk out the door with this tiny, POWERFUL camera and tripod has allowed me to take a lot more pictures.I think this camera would be great for someone who's just getting into photography but knows they want to eventually do more than auto-shoot, and for someone like me who's returning after a long hiatus from photography.""
"20110606","5.0","The only compact camera for actually taking photos","I have had Sony, Canon and Panasonic compacts and did find the Sony to be good at times, but fell down in some situations, the Canons were always good and except for low light performance, I think I might consider the smaller sensor Canons.  Panasonics have great features and if photographic quality isn't an issue, they are great, some of the larger format Panasonics can compete, but nothing comes close in a compact.  Having had these and recently purchased this, I find it an excellent camera and great value.There is nothing that is close in this size.  I am able to make the other cameras work, but I can easily get amazing results from this. I can push the background back to bring up the subject.  The lens has a nice boke, which is utterly amazing in a compact P&S.  And the quality is generally excellent.  I have seen some less than perfect shots, but I come back feeling the camera will help me correct any mistakes.  It won't compete with a DSLR, but it is so nice and small.I considered the G12, but really went for the easy carry compact size feeling that the G12 offered more, but not much I needed.  If I really need more, than I'll get the big gun (the inexpensive lens for which cost more than this). This is in my pocket.  Always. It still turns out great quality.I don't want to see Canon turn this into some sort of super zoom - or movie maker (unless they can keep the size the same with a bigger sensor)  I don't want GPS or any idiot modes.  The pop up flash is odd, but doesn't really affect much.  I haven't noticed battery life issues yet.  I have seen some blow out and odd focus choices, and I find the menus a bit challenging.  I don't like the auto setting, leaving that for when I am taking tourist shots as auto doesn't use raw and the focus can't be changed, but it is OK if all I am doing is taking a shot of a sign which helps explain what the next real shot is all about.  Like when taking interesting detail shots in Soho in London and I want to remember what I was thinking, I write it down 'Soho, London, still life in an alley' and take a picture of it.  Old school GPS.Where this camera can go is into darker situations, in pockets and still perform with excellent quality, because when I am walking on a path and look up to see the sun shining through some clouds in behind a tree in a way that the scene really looks like it is on fire, I don't want to look back on that shot and think, wow, what a great moment, too bad the clouds look all fuzzy because I didn't have my good camera on hand.  Fortunately, my companion had her Canon that day and now I have one.What would I ask Canon to improve?  I'd suggest a slightly longer zoom, yes.  I think they could stretch this and still have a nice lens.  I would really want a faster lens.  I like being able to take photos at 2.0 aperture and would love if they could get 2.8 out of the current range.  It is still better than the competition, but there is potential. That'd be worth a bit of space.Then add another small dial on top for more manual control. One on the top, one on back (which it already has). It would be brilliant.  It already can use the dial on back and the lens ring, but I'd like to focus as well.  Already, a little compact camera that one can directly change the aperture and shutter speed with a dial (or program a dial for something else if you must) just like a real DSLR camera!  I just want to be able to set the front ring as a focus ring and still do it.  It would be pocket size photo nirvana.  As is, it isn't hard to change and I've not seen the like in a point and shoot.I'd also like to see it made weather proof.  I always worry about dust and scratches and rain.  I've had cameras lost to dust and worry about rain showers.In truth, I worry that Canon probably doesn't put so much into this, the market is too small and the cost for the sensor is high, but I think the market is building and a great niche, so come on, throw some resources on this great little camera.It really is a great camera for just taking photos. It is no DLSR, but the only better cameras are made by Nikon and Canon and are all bigger, starting with the G12 and the Nikon P7000.  I took some photos with owners of a G12, a panasonic GF2 (I think) and a Canon EOS1D Mark III and all were impressed and funny enough, none of them had their cameras handy because they are harder to carry around.It is a little power house.""

It can ALWAYS be with you! The camera easily fits in a shirt pocket or purse and is always ready to deliver fine images. Many 'Pro' photographers purchase this camera for 'their wives', but most wives never touch it! I know many pros who carry around the S95 when it is not convenient to haul around an SLR with a bunch of lenses.When out for an evening I never bring my Canon SLR along, but am seldom without the S95. For a quick snap shot around a table to cityscapes from street level or building top, this little gem delivers amazing images. You won't enlarge the images to wall size, but up to 8.5 x 11 and even larger, the images hang on many walls.Needless to say I really do like this camera and I am sure you will too!""
"20110603","4.0","HD video works well for a P&S","I've had the camera for a month or so and purchased it to be a point & shoot with extra controls like my dSLR.  You can find hundreds of reviews online for its photographic capabilities but I wanted to mention the video capabilities.  I've taken a few impromptu HD videos with it and have been pleasantly surprised at the resulting video and sound quality.  I didn't have huge hopes for that aspect of it as I'm used to my Canon S11 camcorder which has been great but the S95 actually doesn't do too bad.  The pictures are crisp and clear and more surprisingly, the sound quality is good too.  I've been at a few concerts where video equipment wasn't allowed (oops) and brought the S95 in in my pocket and I've taken video of songs that, watching them later on my computer, came out sounding really well with reasonable bass reproduction that I'm not used to hearing result from a little point & shoot camera microphone.""

Compared to everything else in it's class and smaller cameras, it's a fantastic choice.  My only gripe is it's a bit slick and doesn't feel secure in my hands but a wrist strap fixes that easy enough.

I was tired of the poor image quality of the Olympus and decided to look for a flagship model.  I definitely found it!  This camera is top-notch.  You can easily shoot dSLR quality photos with this camera, not to mention it fits easily in your pocket.This camera is loaded with features including full manual control.  As a photo enthusiast who also shoots with a dSLR, it is awesome to be able to have the same capabilities in my point-and-shoot.Also, a large plus is the ability to shoot RAW.  I have also purchased an Ikelite underwater housing and accessories to use this camera while SCUBA diving.  For this use, RAW is a must.  With this camera you can shoot professional level UW photos without breaking the bank by purchasing a housing for a dSLR.I can not say enough good things about this camera.  You will not be disappointed!One last note... when giving the camera (in auto-mode) to a stranger to take a picture, make sure you warn them about the pop-out flash.  I have had people almost drop the camera when the flash popped out in low-light settings!""

After a few days of browsing around online, I came across the Canon PowerShot S95. One of my photographer friends had the PowerShot S90, and I had heard nothing but good things about it so I did a little bit of research about the newer model. It turns out that there were tons of.... Read the rest of the review here: [...]""
"20110525","4.0","S95 vs. G12","I'll be straight to the point. I've owned an S90 (same thing as S95) but sold it when S95 was announced. But then the G12 was announced as well, so I did some research and testing. I came to the conclusion that despite the fact that S95 and G12 have the same sensor and image processor, the G12 makes better pictures! I'm not sure if it's the lens or something else, but after I compared my pictures taken with the S90 and then the G12, the latter have visibly LESS noise in low light, are sharper straight out of the camera, and less blurry in the seemingly same shooting conditions (much more keepers when photographing moving subjects or shooting in low light with slow shutter). I own a few DSLR cameras and I am almost totally happy with the G12 as a compact substitute. I was only so-so happy with the S90, even though it's a very nice camera. So, if you are deciding between the two cameras, try them both and see for yourself. To me, the difference is very real.""
"20110525","4.0","Very good camera but pricey","I bought the Canon S95 after a terrible experience with the Canon 300 HS. All I wanted was a pocket-sized point and shoot, reliable and acceptable picture quality. When I say picture quality, I will add that I use mostly DSLRs (7D, T2i, XSi), and I also have the excellent G11. But I needed a point and shoot for a particular project, and the reviews were very flattering for the 300 HS. Unfortunately, many of the reviewers don't really understand what good quality looks like, especially when it comes to lowlight situations, and effects of ISO. The pictures on the 300 HS were muddy and muted, and anything over ISO 400 looked very grainy and noisy. Perhaps I could have lived with that but the camera also received a lens error message repeatedly within hours of use, rendering it useless. As much as I did not want to spend twice the money,  I decided to go for the S95. It did not exceed my expectations, it did everything I expected from a 400 dollar camera. There is nothing I can ding it for except for it's rather high price. It is compact, light and the controls are very clever. There is nothing to be said about the picture quality, it is excellent as claimed by Canon and the reviewers. Yes, the better sensor has a lot to do with but I can't help but think if the 300 HS had a lower megapixel count, it would've made for a better picture quality.As for reliability, I understand the dreaded lens error message is quite prevalent but I am crossing my fingers.""
"20110524","5.0","Beautiful Masterpiece!!!!","Initially I was a little skeptical about spending the big bucks to get this camera. I have always had a Canon and was willing to switch to another brand mainly because of the night shots my camera took.  I had the Canon SD IS 1100 and thought of giving Canon one last try based on few recommendations from my friend.  So I ended up getting the Canon S95 and my wife took this to SFO for her girls trip and all the ladies loved the pics it took.  IT is really amazing and definitely worth the price.

I don't need to rehash what everybody else has said - for this purpose, it is excellent (perhaps the best on the market), but it is no replacement for a DSLR. Image quality can be close under the right conditions though (good lighting, essentially).After using it for a few weeks, the one issue that really sticks out is the blue channel performance under tungsten lighting. Some noise is to be expected here, but it is ATROCIOUS at ISO 1600 or above. Without serious post-processing, indoor non-flash photos are pretty unusable. If you stick to the wide end of the lens you can avoid this, but even at 50mm equivalent you're already limited to to f/3.2 and the long end is f/4.9. Maybe my D5000 has spoiled me, but it seems that the low-light performance of the S95 is a bit overstated.The pop-up flash, which most people seem to complain about, is actually a good thing. It moves the flash far enough from the lens that red-eye rarely happens. You need to turn the flash compensation down, though - on its own it uses too much power in most cases. If you really want to get creative, it can be turned down very low and still have enough power to trigger an optical off-camera slave. I haven't tried this in practice, but I've experimented and strobist-type tricks are definitely possible.All that said, I love this camera, and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. It's on my belt 100% of the time, and that's the killer feature. Just don't expect perfection.""
"20110522","5.0","S95 vs LX5","I'd had my eyes on this camera for months. I'm not a pro photographer by any means, more of a novice, but the great thing about this camera is that it actually helps one learn about photography. Adjusting settings like the f stop, iso, and shutter speed are reflected in real time on the LCD screen so you're seeing what each setting does.One of the reasons I bought this camera was to take photos that allow for blurring of the background, focusing on the subject in the foreground. This may seem trivial, but this feat is extremely difficult with cheaper point and shoots that don't have an aperture priority mode. I moved up from a new Nikon S8100, a good but not great camera. While there are many modes with my Nikon and it's got more megapixels, the images taken with my S95 are better because of the larger, better sensor.The adjusting ring located around the lens is very easy to use. You can adjust it to control various settings. Mine is set to focus. When adjusting the focus, the camera conveniently displays a mini screen within the LCD screen that shows what you are focusing on.For a lot of people, it's down to this camera and the Panasonic LX5 or the Nikon P700. I'm not familiar with the P700 but I have done some research on the LX5. The sensor is larger on the LX5 and it's got a wider angle lens. I have seen pics taken with both in a Cameralabs review and the LX5 seems to take clearer pictures during the day, but the S95 does just a tad better with more natural looking artifacts at higher isos. In terms of the physical body, the S95 is sleeker and doesn't require a lens cap. The S95 lacks, however, a hot shoe for attachments/accessories. But smaller isn't always better. The S95 can be a bit hard to keep in your hands when adjusting the center control ring, even with my medium sized hands. The battery in the LX5 lasts longer and the LX5 has a dedicated button for shooting video. One thing I was disappointed with was the fact one cannot adjust the focus in video shooting mode. This would have made a great bonus.So the bottom line when choosing between the two cameras comes down to price and availability. Both cameras are awesome, with the S95 cheaper but harder to find in stock in many stores. I snagged a S95 on sale and was lucky to find one.""
"20110520","3.0","Awesome images. Lens error in a month.","This is the best Canon compact I have had in about 3 years. Picture quality is awesome, and low light performance rocks. I will write more details later, but for now I am frustrated.I pulled the camera out of the case today to find the lens partially extended and the dreaded 'Lens Error. Will shut down automatically. Please restart camera.' Otherwise known as a E18 error. I've restarted the camera numerous times, and at no point has the motor made any noise, or has the lens moved. I can't say how frustrating this is. Mostly because I have become quite attached to this one is a short time, and it's part of my daily routine. I hope it'll be covered under warranty.. Updates to come.How about an option for resetting this error, or attempting to move the lens manually with the zoom control. Anything that would allow the user to troubleshoot this. I have to believe that things are set up to fail safe, and there is room for some trying. Otherwise Canon has a serious problem with lens extension mechanisms.""

ISO stays around 600 in low light and image is MUCH CLEANER.Now S95 is almost perfect.Note: Sepia filter is removed in S95 but you get miniature mode instead.Still I prefer manual pop up flash like the LX5. This one has to scroll through buttons to activate the flash - that's the only flaw which is BIG to me.""
"20110518","5.0","For the professional photapher","For the professional photographer that does not want to carry their big dslr everywhere this is the 'point and shoot' camera to get.""
"20110514","5.0","Amazing camera!","I have never had a point and shoot and up to this point I have used much larger cameras (i.e., Nikon F100, D70, Canon AE-1).  I wanted to buy a camera that would allow me to start taking pictures again after not having touched my cameras for 3-4 years and I wanted a camera that would produce quality images, but would not be very cumbersome.  That is precisely what this camera does, and on top of it, it produces high quality video that allows you to record a variety of events without the inconvenience of having to carry around a much larger camera.  I am extremely satisfied with this product.  My ONLY two complaints about this camera are (1) that, depending on the mode, the flash can pop up while your finger is on the place where it is housed, causing the flash to freeze in place and requiring you to turn it off and then back on again.  Not sure how this could have been avoided though considering that it is precisely where you would expect the flash to be housed and (2) on the video you sometimes get vertical lines.  That said, I am consistently impressed with the high quality of the images produced, even when taken in very low light situations.  If you can swing it, you will not regret buying this camera.""
"20110512","5.0","Excellent DSLR alternative","I bought this as an alternative to my canon 30D that would be easier to carry regularly.  I've had it for about 4 months and am extremely impressed with the picture quality.  I must admit I use this only in full manual mode.  I don't use any of the auto features or the flash. I set the iso as slow as conditions allow and adjust the exposure manually based on the composition.  If you want complete control over your exposure then this is an ideal camera with picture quality that rivals my dslr.  If you want an idiot proof point and shoot then you can find one for less than half the price.  If you were upset by the demise of Kodachrome 64 then consider this camera.""
"20110512","4.0","Great still photo camera, video just good.","I previously owned the Canon SD870IS and I loved that camera.  The s95 is a great upgrade, so if you're upgrading from the SD870IS, it's safe!  Pictures are outstanding, even in auto mode.  Manual mode has lots of options for those that know what they're doing!  Video looks beautiful but I wish it was 30fps instead of 24fps.  As some have stated, relatively fast action at 24fps comes out a little too jerky for me.  Lack of auto-focus while recording is inexcusable for a camera at this price point.  I've read that this can be overcome with a CHDK firmware update, but have yet to try this.  I haven't run into the battery problems that some have pointed out.  I've used the camera for a few parties shooting both pics and video and each time the battery level showed to be not less than 1/2 life remaining.  Obviously people will get different mileage based on what they're doing.Despite my gripes, I don't regret getting this camera.  The video is still good and with a little thought up front, the video can be great.  When the s9x upgrade comes out, I'll be onboard as long as they up the frame rate to 30fps, at which point it will be a complete all-around camera!""

"20110509","2.0","2nd bad experience in a row with Canon PowerShot models","I've been a loyal Canon PowerShot owner since 2003, with the S95 being my 5th such Canon compact point-and-shoot camera in a row. I loved the first 3 models, and their early demises were all my fault (dropped 2 in water, and had a 3rd one stolen from my checked luggage en route to Costa Rica...lesson learned). I loved the high quality and reliability of the pictures, and the small size made for an ideal vacation camera. I was more likely to take the PowerShot everywhere I went which meant more opportunities for great pictures, as opposed to lugging around a larger, more advanced model that I couldn't slide in my pocket.However, the sx210is (the 14x optical zoom was the big selling point for me) was my first big disappointment - it had a very long shutter lag, and its auto-focus repeatedly failed to deliver. I missed countless shots during a trip to South America because either the camera took too long to fire after pressing the button, or the picture would be severely blurred because the camera would fire before the auto-focus was able to finish its job. It was a huge step backwards in reliability and quality from the earlier models.I recently purchased the s95 to replace the disappointing sx210. After working fine for 3 weeks, it started 'freaking out'. Newly charged batteries would drain very fast (within an hour) even while the camera was powered off. The flash seemed to be at the core of the issues - it ceased to extract itself when needed (yes, the flash setting was on 'auto'). Furthermore, the camera would completely freeze/ lock-up when the flash eventually did pop-up. I couldn't even turn-off the camera, as the On/Off button was unresponsive - I had to wait for it to power-down on its own, after the which the problem above persisted if the flash was involved. Finally, an error message stating 'flash in incorrect position, restart camera' would occasionally pop-up, even when the flash was in the closed position.Needless to say, I've placed a warranty call to Canon and am sending the camera in for warranty service. Regardless, it's disappointing to have had separate issues with my two most recent PowerShot purchases after having been happy with this line for so long. Hopefully this is not a new downward trend in product quality from Canon. But after 2 disappointments in a row, I'll likely be looking at other brands for my next camera purchase.""
"20110505","1.0","ALMOST USELESS FOR  MANUAL OPERATION","This camera is advertised and promoted by Canon as a compact camera with manual mode 'loaded with all a serious photographer's must-haves'...it isn't.I contacted Canon customer service and they verified all of the following problems;(1) Most disappointing is the fact that this camera has no light meter.  For those of us who understand how to use manual operation this means that even if you can control the f Stop and shutter speed separately, you will have no way of knowing if you exposure is correct.  So, it is almost impossible to use manual mode and alter the depth of field or do any kind of exposure variations.  Canon confirmed this.(2) This camera's highest F stop is f5.6 in telephoto and f8 in wide.  This seriously limits your ability to gain long distance depth of field, so landscape photography or travel pics in which you want a large area to be in focus are out of the question.  It basically works within the same range that a point and shoot camera works; at 3 to 4 times the price.(3) The operating manual is almost useless.  It is nothing but an exercise in putting in the battery, turning it on and snapping a picture.  It has almost no instructions about mode variations and nothing on the use of manual mode (now I know why).  I spent hours working through the menus and was still having trouble using it.  I got so frustrated that I called Canon; their tech support person couldn't explain it's use and had to get a supervisor to tell me that I was correct about points 1 and 2 above.(4) The zoom lever (at least on the one I received) is not smooth at all; it zooms too fast and sometimes it is slow to start.  This causes a bunch of back and forth zooming to get the composition that you want.  I realize that this is a compact camera but most of the controls are hard to manipulate and I have small hands.(5) It has no viewfinder.  For some this will not be a problem but for me; I like looking through a viewfinder not an LCD screen.This camera has serious limitations. I didn't expect it to be the same as my SLR but it does not even come close to an SLRs manual operation and for $425, and the way Canon promotes it, it should.If you understand how to use a camera in manual mode,coupled with a light meter and this is how you want to use this camera, you will be very disappointed. If you just want to shoot pictures of the friends and family etc, then you would be much better off spending $100-$150 on a good point and shoot and using it in auto mode.""
"20110504","5.0","Awesome Camera","This is one of the best cameras I've ever owned. It takes amazing pictures for one of its size and price.""
"20110503","5.0","Best small camera on the market?","I am by no means a camera expert or a photographer, but I do like to listen to their opinions when buying cameras. The S95 was reviewed very positively, and after having used it for 5 months, I can say that it's even better than what I expected.First, it was much smaller than I thought it would be. Reading the dimensions is one thing, but when you actually are able to hold this camera, you can truly appreciate how portable it really is, about the size of a pack of cigarettes would be about right. It is very, very solid, you can tell that it was built to last and the finish is very understated, which is what I prefer. One thing about the size though, if you have large hands, it may be challenging to grip the camera comfortably each time, especially when you are trying to do it quickly.The picture quality is I think outstanding. I'm sure the pictures would look even better if I knew how to properly take pictures, but using the P mode, the images look natural and great pretty much every time. Despite being on the lower side in terms of megapixels, the images have a good amount of detail, and with the fast lens, low light pictures have significantly better results. There is also aperture and shutter priority modes, so you can experiment, or even use full manual. The lens is very flush to the body, and will jut out when the camera is on and ready to take pictures. But what I thought was a cool feature was the adjustable ring around the lens, you can set this to do one of several functions, and it works very well.Overall an excellent camera and an excellent value.""
"20110502","5.0","The BEST compact camera out there...","I was worried about the price but its worth every penny. Did all my research and looked around and this definitely is clearly the best camera out there as of 4/1/2011. Low light photos are the best. I haven't seen indoor low light pictures this beautiful before. Was thinking of a DSLR but felt its not worth the learning curve nor the bulky size. If you can get that DSLR quality at a fraction of the size and complexity, who wouldn't prefer the compact. Finally, great choice and its my Best purchase ever. Go Canon.Note: Don't get fooled by 10.0 MP while you see 15MP one's out there. That's all a myth. Goto dpreview etc and research about the megapixel myths. When you go to a store, look at the f/2.0 numbers and there isn't one out there in a compact camera that's close to 2.0.  Lot's of 2.5's and 2.3.""

"20110427","5.0","Superb with a few faults","Just came back from two weeks in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos with the S95 as my only camera.  I was breaking the SLR habit as I needed to travel light and it is genuinely liberating not to have a SLR around your neck.  You can carry the S95 and two extra batteries in a single pocket.A quick review of the 2400 plus photos I came back with in Picassa on the iMac 27 shows great color rendition,  excellent contrast and great sharpness.  I'm not at all regretting the decision to bring only the S95.  I was also looking at the LX-5 as the 24mm Leica lens was very attractive to me.  However the additional size would be an issue and there seems to be some concern about the JPEG color rendition.  I have no interest in a great deal of post processing so JPEG rendition is very important to me.  This is the fourth small Canon I've had.  I've only had a problem with one, a is870 that developed a gray spot on the LCD.  I bought and would recommend a screen protector for the LCD in an abundance of caution even though I'm not generally a screen saver kind of guy.Some random thoughts:  The camera is pretty sturdy (at times it reminded me of my old Nikon F3 for reasons not entirely clear to me) and the black finish is tough and plenty grippy,  LCD screen is excellent and is visible even in bright light.  Full auto mode is hard to beat.  Other modes are useful for specific situations.  The other mode I used most often is low light.  However you should set up the buttons so that with one push you can set WB to the scene as the auto mode in low light is not always accurate.  The problem with the low light mode is that it jacks the ISO up quite a bit.  However it can capture photos in extremely low light conditions that even my SLR could not take.  There are sometimes focus issues in low light mode but it easily goes into manual focus.  The pixilation at ISO's up to 800 is not bad.You can set up different modes to access immediately key settings.  For example you can set up Tv to shoot vivid or slide film color mode and then use auto or another mode to shoot normal color.  You can also shoot in different aspect ratios.  There are many different modes, some of which are useful.  The external ring is best used to set focal length in my experience.  The rotating ring on the back is most often used for exposure variation unless you are shooting in full manual mode.The battery life is not impressive although I admit that I have no idea of how many photos per battery I was getting.  However having three batteries was mandatory for a full days' shooting - although you'll have to recharge more before you go out at night.  The size of the camera is a blessing and a curse.  The small size makes panning smoothly in video mode difficult and getting photos level even with the grid in place sometimes difficult.I have to say that while there are minor nits they are far outweighed by the enormous capabilities of this camera.  If you're looking for a solid camera with a wide range of capabilities and a solid auto mode when you just want to look for targets the S95 would be difficult to beat.""

"20110418","5.0","A few quick comments about the s95, TL500 and LX-5","Let me say from the outset, image quality, good ergonomics and compact size are what I mostly need in a camera of this typeI have used this camera for 4 months solidly, its what I put in my pocket when I dont want to take my Olympus e620 (also a relatively compact camera in its class)Naturally there are compromises to be made in using one of these compared to an SLR and others have already gone there.So my comments are based on what would be expected for a camera in this class compared to similar top end compact cameras such as TL500, LX-5 (which I have only tried in the shops for 15 minutes)Im more or less assuming image quality is going to be similar, I like to shoot in RAW so minor faults in things like white balance, sharpening, noise reduction, exposure accuracy can be sorted out later in Lightroom on the big screenWhat is more likely to influence the images I get are the ability to be in the right place at the right time with the camera settings ready to goThings I like especially about the s95 are the fact it is the smallest of the top end compacts so I find it easy to have with me, the customizable ring around the lens (which I use to choose exact zoom range at 28, 35, 50 and 85mm, it helps me visualize frames better in my mind when I use standard zoom lengths), customizable shortcut button which I have set to ISO (or AE lock), built in lens cap, easy to delete unwanted photos you have just taken, reasonably responsive shutter speedDislike, the fact the aperture is f/2.0 only at 28mm and gets smaller and smaller compared to say Samsung TL500 or Olympus XZ1Wish list; I wish it had a menu item for set zoom lengths (at the moment only the lens ring has this ability. Otherwise you just use the zoom lever and there is no numerical feedback as to the focal length. This would free the lens ring for other thingsI wish it had a snap focus setting like the Ricoh GRD III so I could shoot from the hip a bit fasterIf I didnt get this I would probably get the TL500 because of the wider zoom at 24mm, the more solid brick like build, the slightly faster lens and the cheaper price!Thats it in a nut shell!""

The closeups, sunsets, and people shots all looked wonderful. The image quality was great. The third day that I had it, I got a 'lens error' and it stopped working. I looked through the manual and internet and couldn't find any solutions. I took it back to BestBuy, where they have a two week return policy and got another one. Same thing!!! I test shot about a half dozen photos and a few short video clips and got great results. I was just as impressed as the first time. The next time i pulled the camera out, i got the same 'lens error' message and an unusable camera. Back to BestBuy where their Geek Squad also deemed the camera unusable. I turned down the option of another s95 and took a refund instead. I looked on the internet for 'Canon s95 problems' and just came up with simple generic issues. When I tried again with a search for 'Canon s95 lens error restart' I found quite a few people had this same problem. I was very frustrated as I really liked everything about the camera and it's quality images but that was completely meaningless if the camera either had a serious design or manufacturing flaw. I've returned to using my older Canon SD780 as I begin another search for a 'pocket' camera. I get a headache thinking about trying to use the Canon s95 at a once in lifetime photo op and having it malfunction. Luckily for me, the camera broke down within the return period. Until Canon has better quality control or re-engineers this camera, I would recommend that this model be avoided. I was extremely disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!""
"20110406","1.0","Manufacturing or design flaw????????","I've had several small 'pocket' size Canon cameras and have enjoyed them as something quick and convenient as an alternate to my DSLRs. I was very interested in the fact that the Canon s95 had the ability to produce 'raw' files and shoot in low light with a relatively fast lens. The day I purchased the s95,  I was able to test it in some very low light conditions, shooting both stills and video with stereo sound. The results were very very impressive. The second day that I had the camera, I lucked out with a combination of dramatic weather and lighting to further test out the image quality. Once again I was very impressed. The third day, seeing a spontaneous photo opportunity, I pulled out the s95 and pushed the 'on' button. I was immediately rewarded with a 'lens error restart' message, making the camera unusable. Searching through the manual and the internet for solutions proved fruitless. I took the camera back to the nearby BestBuy, where they have a fourteen day return policy. Leaving the store with another new Canon s95 I was able to try a few more test shots, again getting great results. A couple days later I shot about six photos and a two or three short video clips. Later in the day, encountering another interesting photo situation, I pulled the camera out and had another 'lens error restart' message. As the camera was non working and not user correctible, I returned this camera to BestBuy, turned down the offer of still another Canon s95 and opted for a refund. I was extremely frustrated by this as when the camera worked, I absolutely loved it's handling and image quality. Since I had two cameras quickly break down, with very little use, I have to suspect that Canon has a severe manufacturing or design flaw in this camera. When I Googled 'Canon s95 lens error restart', i found out that a number of other people have had the exact same problem. Luckily for me, it happened within the 14 day return period.

It took outstanding pictures on Auto. I haven't used manual yet so I can't comment on that. Also brought my Canon PowerShot A590IS which is 8.0 megapixels. I found myself using the S95 alot more than my A590IS. We mostly took pictures at night with the S95 and they came out amazing! It definately takes great night shots or with dim lighting. My A590IS didn't even compare. I know they're different series but still i was impressed. So far i've only had experience with 4 digital cameras, 3 Canons and 1 Fuji and so far the S95 is my favorite! Had to get used to not having a view finder and also the flash that pops up but no biggie. I'm also used to the shot button on the far right hand side like my A590IS, on the S95 the shot button is to the left of dial. As far as battery life I have taken over 300 pictures and it still shows full battery. I was worried it would be a battery eater from some of the comments so I ended up getting another spare one. I'm sure it'll come in handy some day. This is definately a keeper so far.""
"20110330","4.0","Super snappy picture taking fun","This camera is a huge step up from all the other digital cameras I have owned before (coolpix, etc) in terms of picture quality.  In trying to improve my food/lifestyle blog I needed a point and shoot camera to take food close up, and scenery on the go - this camera does both with ease. The picture quality is far better than twice that of any other camera I have owned, and therefore really worth the extra cost.  The only down side is that when on automatic the flash unit rises from the top of the camera precisely where my left index finger seems to always be -  a minor ergonomic design flaw (of course I could remember to hold it in a different way) and it is a bit heavier than others, but not by too much.  This is a really great camera for my purpose and I am so glad I own it!""
"20110330","4.0","My favorite compact so far","I own many 'best' compacts -- such as Fuji F30, Fuji F100, Panasonic LX-5 -- the S95 is my favorite of the bunch.Here's what I like about the S95:- Great out of camera JPEG colors (much more to my likings than LX5)- Small enough to conveniently take anywhere (unlike LX5)- Quick startup and response- Easy to use manual controls and menu systemHere's what can be improved:- Battery life not too great- Slow shot to shot time when using flash unless you have a fresh battery- Support zoom during video (like LX5)- Support full HD video at 30fps instead of 24fps (like LX5)Though the LX5 has a nicer lens and better video, I still prefer the S95 for the reasons above.""
"20110329","5.0","Satisfied","I compared the S95 with several other cameras in terms of features and prices before I bought the S95.  I am quite satisfied with my selection.Previously, I owned a Rebel XTi and was very happy with it.  The S95 is much more portable.  The main drawback is the lack of an optical view finder, but, I understand this is a necessary trade-off for portability.  So, I can't blame it.""

"20120404","4.0","Amazing great camera","It performs up to expectations.  Great colour, focus, speed, manual and automatic controls, etc.  Great camera.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because for the difference in price, you rather go for the S100 with better zoom, slow motion video and faster 'High-speed burst function' (shooting continuously when the shutter button is held down). I actually don't really get trilled for the higher resolution of 12.1 MP since the more megapixels (generally) less light sensitivity for indoor pictures.  Anyway, in my opinion, best camera in the world (other than reflex).""
"20120331","4.0","Excellent small, take-everywhere, camera","I really like having the S95 as a complimentary small camera to carry when I want something better than my iPhone 4 but not as big and heavy as my D7000. Movies look good and the ability to capture raw files is great. The ability to change main settings easily is nice but I find myself using P mode most of the time since it is a 'point and shoot'. I got this camera when it was on sale as a 'Gold Box Deal Of The Day' so it was a great value. The current price is the only thing that gives me pause (and the reason for the 4 star rating). It just depends on how much you value having such a competent camera in a very small package.""

It was selected specifically because it had superior lens and image-capture features, as well as a great reputation for quality.  It did not disappoint.  The pictures and short video that has been shared have been excellent.  In fact, I am about to shop for another one for myself.  Pictures shot with this camera compare very favorably with shots taken with much more expensive SLR models, without the bother and fuss of additional lenses and the bulk of the SLR, especially when a young family has enough other things to be carrying around.  A curious fact is that the newer version, the S100 is not as highly rated, so this model is more desirable, if you can find one.""

"20120308","5.0","WONDERFUL!!!","I had been struggling with buying a new camera. I typically have a very compact point and shoot AND a huge SLR and use them for varying needs. When looking at this camera I found it to be much larger than the average point and shoot which you throw in your purse or pocket and run out for a quick day of hiking or family fun time. However the great benefit is that with it's increase in size I am able to have so much more control over the camera as is possible with an SLR. I would say even for a point and shoot it is still pretty compact.the Pictures are great- will not go into huge detail here as there are tons of reviews on this areazoom , low light and faster movement is easily captured. Again this is not a total high end SLR replacement but really an amazing hybrid to get those of you with a pension for photography something smaller and more compact that allows you to do more.CONSThe Flash is super Annoying - when you hold the camera you have to make sure to hold as an SLR instead of a point and shoot (right hand on corner and shutter button, left hand under the camera holding the lens area.) otherwise the flash pops up and throws you off.Camera is a little slippery in the hand, the texture or finish is maybe a little too smooth.""
"20120304","4.0","Better than some 16MP camears","I bought following and returned 'coz the pictures taken by these were not sharp enough:1. Canon PowerShot ELPH 3002. Olympus SZ30Above two didn't come close to my 7 year old (now broken 'coz of mis-handling) Olympus Camedia 4000. Finally, I found this Canon S95 and am very happy with results.What's wrong with Steve's DigiCams review site? Go there and compare sample shots taken by all of the above cameras. Also, check out Olympus Camedia 4000 in there. Even with cheap LCD monitor the differences are very obvious. Yet, Steve's tends to praise all cameras. I guess since manufacturer's give him camears (as opposed to Consumer Reports buying them from street).In short S95 is a superb camera. I don't care about mega-pixels as much about sharpness. A huge portion of my pictures are for web upload; not so much printing. So, extremely happy with S95.""

"20110321","4.0","Canon PowerShot S95","This is not a professional review. Just my thoughts.I purchased this camera for two reasons: kids and dogs indoors and out.I am only a novice, but love cameras and taking pictures of the afore mentioned.I needed something that could handle moving targets and low light.I like the fact that it is small, though not too tiny. I like that it feels like it is made well. I like the quality of some of the photos I've gotten. I'm lucky if half turn out so I always take a lot.My biggest gripe, like many others, is the location of the flash. That could have been so much better. It is not so easy to hold the camera where I would normally hold it. If the picture quality hadn't been as nice, I'd have returned it for that issue.Because I am such a novice, I am unable to correct the temperature of the pictures. It seems the pictures all come out with a warmer tone (a slight yellowish cast) than I like. I actually prefer cooler tones on most things. But the option of warm/cool tones is not on this camera or I can't find it. Besides the flash, that is the biggest draw back for me, because I have to color correct every picture and that is time consuming.But, I am quite pleased with the detail I've gotten on around half the pictures. It replaced my Fuji F31fd...which was a tough decision to make. I don't regret that decision...just wish I could change the color temp and move the doggone flash. :)I gave the f31fd to my daughter who had lost her camera and kept borrowing mine.""

It still works to this day, but i thought it was time for an upgrade since the family was going on vacay and i wanted the best possible pics to remember it. I wanted to stick with Canon since i loved the one i had so much. Size was important(since i am not ready to lug around a big bad, just for a camera), and great picture quality. I think this camera is exactly what i was looking for. I've had it for about 3 days now and i've been able to figure out a lot of the 'fancier' functions like controlling shutting speed, aperture, and the low light capturing pretty quickly. This was something i never tried to do on my old camera, im not even sure if my old one could. This one was easy to figure out and i am no camera expert. The pictures i have taken so far blow me away compared to the norm ive had over the past 5 years. I am in love with my new camera. There is so much more that i can play around with.My only complaint is the wrist strap. it's just one big loop that hangs around your wrist and could fall off very easily. i plan on purchasing a new one that has a way of adjusting the hole to fit my wrist. My old canon had a great wrist strap so i dont know why they would get rid of them. Other than that i highly recommend to people who want a great camera in a small package.""

The S95 corrects some of the ergonomic issues of the S90.Within its circle of capability (no moving objects, lighting that isn't so tricky you need a filter) the S95 is as good as my D90 and D7000.  They just have a bigger circle of capability.  Maybe the D7000 does colors a little bit better, maybe.I've owned about six or seven Canon Digital Elphs (Elves?).  They've all been good cameras.  I've lost a couple.  One grew fungus in its lens (carrying it around on the floor of my car in Portland winters wasn't a good idea.).  So far no failures; nothing but good pictures.

Upon inserting the battery, the camera began to work like new!?!?!  Glad to have it back in action, but it goes to show that Canon was trying to suck more money out of me.  Obviously it was not completely unrepairable as they stated, seeing that it just decided to work again.  It has been working fine for probably the last month and has not had any problems since the power issue.  The only thing that I can attribute to the resurrection is that I moved from a humid climate to a very dry one.Original Story:Short story:Camera lived for two months.  It broke overnight and Canon claims that it was corrosion.  The camera was never subjected to anything other than humidity.  Canon did not care and offered a refurbished one for $174.11.  The camera did not take the best pics either, as my S400 took better ones and it is only 4 MP vs the 10MP S95.  Probably will not buy Canon anymore, as they seem to be making junk.  Evidence of this can be seen by the many other reviews online about corrosion issues with the S95. Just search S95 corrosion and you will see.""

"20110312","1.0","The most overhyped camera of 2010","I really wanted to like this camera. I wanted a high quality, rangefinder like, digital camera to carry as an alternative to my DSLR. I picked this over the LX5 mostly because it was somewhat smaller and the many people carried it in their pants pocket. Frankly unless you have baggy clothes I did not find this to be a workable option(too thick and the lens would catch in the edge of my jeans pocket). I carried it in a Lowepro belt case(like my previous P&Ss). I found the layout of the top of the camera and the motorized pop up flash quite annoying. The top of the camera is quite crowded making it very difficult to use your left hand to stabilize the camera. If you scroll over the auto or force flash setting the will flash pop up so if you are used holding the camera there you will have to adjust your style. The camera has a number of nice features which it should for it's price point and being billed as an enthusiasts camera. In everyday shooting, unless you use the raw processing and/or the extra stop, the photo quality in no better that my wife's Panasonic ZS5 which is about half the price. My main complaint is my camera failed after about two weeks(maybe 150 shots) I received a 'lens error' and the camera just shuts down and says restart camera. No drops, no abuse, no scratches. Then I find out on flickr that this is somewhat common. To make the situation more unpleasant Canon reserves the right to replace my camera with a 'refurbished' model. This does not seem like a fair policy to me.....  Buy a new camera and get a used one in return.  For it's price/ features I would rate this camera 3 to 4 stars. But due to Canon's repair policy and my first hand experience I can only give it a one star rating and hope my customer experience with Canon improves.""

Right in the middle of every photo theres a blue spot no matter what.  At this price point for a point and shoot I'm disappointed to be having issues right out of the box and normally I would write it off as an anomaly but I did my research and a lot of people have the same issue and either returned the cams or had to have them warrantied.  At least I can easily return it as defective but what a hassle.  Canon is slipping on the quality control so make sure if you decide to buy one to thoroughly inspect it.

I wasn't supposed to buy a PowerShot in a while, since 8 months ago I bought a Canon SX210IS in order to have a short trips substitute for my Canon Rebel XSi. I was quite disappointed with the SX210, since it took blurry, not well defined and colorless pictures. Last december, it was stolen from my luggage so I had to buy a new one (my second chance, this time I had to buy a good one). After 8 months, I though not much should have changed, but then I saw many reviews about the new S95 and I was curious. After surfing around, I found this webpage in which you can check and compare easily the specs and other information about many cameras on the market.[...]My first concern, was the flash thing (that it was placed in an unconfortable and not intuitive place). FORGET ABOUT IT. The SX210 was a real pain in the a.., every time I wanted to take a picture I found my finger stopping the flash to pop up. With the S95, even if the flash is placed in the same place, it has enough space behind to let you place your finger without interfering with the flash.The zoom is perfect! Even the digital zoom is amazing.The size and weight, no comments! Just great!But the more important thing about this camera is how amazing and beautiful the pictures come out. It's magic! It just interprets exactly what your eyes see, no more, no less. It has been a while since I am not as happy with an electronic product as I am with this camera! I'm starting to feel sorry for my poor Rebel XSi because it hasn't seen any light since I bought this one!Don't delay your decision, if you want a compact, full feature camera with an incredible image quality, this is the one! If I find out how to upload pictures in here, I'll put a couple.""
"20110304","5.0","Great full feature compact","I bought this to replace my aging S50, which was built like a tank.  I like the Canon S series because I can access manual controls if needed and since I sold my SLR years ago, I really don't feel like I'm missing anything.The S95 is about half the thickness of the old S50 and a fraction of the weight. The outer case has a texture to the finish that helps with grip and prevents fingerprints.  I don't know if it is metal like the old S50, but it sure seems like it.The first thing I noticed is that it starts up in a snap.  That was really important.  Also, it performs very well in low light.  You can turn off the flash during performances and get excellent low light shots.  You can also turn off the sounds and the red-eye lamp to not be so obvious.  My only gripe is that I wish you could turn off the flash and it would stay off when you turn the camera back on.  The controls are pretty intuitive so it isn't that big of a deal.  Oh, and it seems to handle jitter well in low light.  I've got great shots of a school musical that are colorful, clear and crisp. No grain. No blurs.For the most part, I use the SCN mode and select Kids and Pets.  That takes care of motion well.  There are some nice effects that you can do including a fisheye effect which could keep you busy for hours on end.I'm not used to the pop-up flash on the left side. I usually have my finger on it which it doesn't like when it wants to pop up.  You have to get use to a different left hand position.  I'm working on it.I used the HD video to film my daughter figure skating and it is like watching TV when you download it to the PC. Amazing quality and easy to figure out. Just make sure that you let the camera focus before you start filming. If not it seems to be a little out of focus. That could be because I shoot through the protective glass at the ice rink.The software for the PC has been updated.  It is pretty easy to use. There are some differences as compared to the old software. It is faster and has more options. Still figuring all of them out.As far as cases go, I purchased a Lowepro Ridge 10 which was a hair too small.  I returned it for the Ridge 30 which has plenty of room.  I think the Ridge 20 might have been a better fit, but I'll stick with the 30.I'm very happy with this camera.""

"20110303","5.0","Is All That Is Said","The Canon S95 is everything you have ever read about it.  Best feature for me is that it is truely pocketable. Many cameras deemed pocketable are not, at least not in a shirt pocket. You can read all about the technical aspects of the camera in the technical reviews; I am telling you everything good you ever read about it is true.  A couple of slightly bad things too:  It has a shorter battery life than desireable, and I find the shutter release just a bit off center. I keep pushing the mode dial instead; others have said the S90 was this way, and it was corrected on the S95 but I still afind it that way for me.  And the camera looks cool too.""
"20110301","5.0","My FAVORITE S-Series camera from Canon yet.","The first rule of digital photography is you can only take a picture if you have your camera with you. The size of this is absolutely perfect for grabbing on your way out and taking pictures anywhere. This is the best camera I've ever owned. It has all of the manual settings I've come to expect in a larger camera and all of the sharpness and image capturing capabilities of a larger camera, too. I've previously owned the S30 and S80 - both of which had a larger form factor. I was a little skeptical that something so small could match them in clarity and color, but this one does. I'm glad that Canon decided to put a pixel-perfect 10 MP sensor in this rather than a less sensitive or noisier 12 MP sensor. It can take the best low-light photos I've ever seen without using the flash in a camera this size, but I often still opt for the flash indoors.My only complaints are small ones: first, the flash pops up right where most people hold the camera with their left hand. You are supposed to use the ring around the lens with your left hand, but most people don't know that when they pick it up the first time. Second, the dial to change shooting modes is a lot stiffer than the dials on either the S30 and S80, but I guess it has to be given the small size required to fit on the body.Regardless, I love this camera. I would buy it again in a heartbeat and I would recommend it to anyone who can afford the price and wants something a light-years ahead of a cheap point-and-shoot.""

I find myself holding it like a DSLR thanks to that nifty ring on the lens, therefore, I don't have the problems others talk about regarding the flash popping up under their index finger, but I can see how that can happen. Button positions only took an hour to get used to, but they make sense considering the concept. Smudges on the screen? It's a nice big brilliant screen.

Absolutely recommend it to anyone who can stretch budget to ~$350 range rather than ~$150 for normal P&S and you will love your purchase 10/10. It has what other bulky SLR's in $2500+ price range offer""
"20110227","5.0","Professional photographer -- LOVE this camera!","Finally a pocket camera that I can use as a professional photographer when I am trying to take shots of people/street scenes without walking around with my giant Canon lenses!  I have been in the market for a small camera for years and have never been satisfied with the image quality until the S95 came out.  This camera is AMAZING.  It does about 90% of what my $3500 Canon 5D Mk II does.  It is an excellent point and shoot (great for my kids and husband, who don't want to adjust anything) but I love the fact that I can go 'all manual' without a fuss.  I shoot in RAW but husband and kids like JPG for simplicity.  The images are vibrant and sharp.  Skin tones look natural.  Even in extremely low light, the pics are not grainy and have excellent saturation.  Focus in low light is spot on, something that is hard to achieve with most inexpensive cameras.  I have shown my photographs to my students and they have a hard time guessing if it's my $5000 Canon/lens or this $400 super-mini that took the shots....My only gripe is the ergonomics.  The flash pops up RIGHT where I hold the camera so it's a bit annoying.  Also, while the S95 has a more 'nonslip' coating, it is not a rubberized grip like my big Cannon.  I would LOVE to see some rubber on the casing to help make sure it doesn't slip out of my hands.  Finally, on occasion the flash overexposes so I have the EV down -2/3.  That takes care of it.  I just leave it there and my pix are perfect.Cannot recommend highly enough, both to novices who want a great point and shoot and pros who want a small pocket camera that is less conspicuous than the usual 'gear.'""
"20110224","2.0","every "action" shot is blurred....what a disappointment","i bought the Canon S95 as I need my camera to do all the work for me, so thought this sounded like one of the best 'point and shoots'.....anyway, I have been taking photos of my 2 year old dancing (with the camera set to Auto, as instructed in the booklet), and EVERY shot is blurred around the hands, hair and eyes.....AAAARRRGGGH,HOW frustrating.  this was the exact reason I binned my old Sony Cybershot.I am very disappointed and am now thinking this camera can go the same way as the Sony!(does anyone have any ideas how to get clear 'action' shots -please share if you do, thanks)""
"20110220","5.0","Canon Powershot S95","This little camera is a gem. ITs small enough to carry in your pocket. I took it to a concert lounge and the HD movie quality is awesome! However a 7 minute HD video will eat up 1 GB of memory, so make sure you settle for nothing less than an 8 GB memory card. THe picture quality is superb and makes excellent prints. There is so much this little camera can do that it will take alot of time to figure out all its controls and features. The camera comes with:wrist strap, battery charger,  battery pack NB-6L, AV cable, usb interface cable, Canon software solution disc version 72.0.The battery life is rated at about 200 shots so make sure you top the battery off before you use it. One minor annoyance with this camera is when the flash is needed, it pops up unexpectedly where your left hand usually holds it in the corner.IT startles you a little, but nothing too worrisome as all PS cameras with pop up flash does this. YOu will also like the ring control feature where you can customize what feature you want for the ring control.There is no user manual included so you will have to write to Canon and they will mail you one if you request it. This camera also shoots excellent in low light conditions. The same goes with the HD video shooting. This is not an automatic PS camera so you will need to tweek certain operations although it does have a fully automatic mode if you like simplicity.My previous PS camera was a Canon SD1100IS and the S95 beats it hands down in every category! I cannot think of anything where the SD1100 shines over the S95.THe S95 does not have a vew finder but I never use those anyway on PS cameras. However one nice feature on the S95 is that the LSD screen shows you exacltly what the photo will look like before you take the picture. This is a nice  feature especially if you want to shoot in manual mode. MY DSLR camera does not even have this feature. The zoom is only 3.8X so this is not a super zoom lens. However it does have an aperature value of f2.0 to f8.0. THe MM equivalant of the S95 is 28-105 MM.Overall, if you know anything about manual controls, this camera should not be a problem with you. This is a huge step up from the SDxxx series Canon elph cameras and should not be used by anyone that is only familiar with the fully automatic PS cameras.""
"20110217","5.0","The perfect compromise...  for me","The perfect camera does not exist.  There is no camera with the control and quality of a medium format technical camera, the versatility, handling, low light performance and responsiveness of a DSLR, and with the ease of use,  size and cost of a point and shoot.  So the name of the game is compromise.  You will have to sacrifice some less important features to get the ones that are important to you.I already have a nice DSLR, but have found it has one big drawback.  It is too big and heavy, and too conspicuous to have on me all the time.  So I miss shots because it is at home.  To fill that gap, I wanted a small (truly pocketable) camera, with good quality, decent low light performance, and most of the control that my DSLR gives me.  The S95 perfectly fills that gap.Pros:- small and light (easily slips in a trouser or shirt pocket)- excellent picture quality in most circumstances- decent low light performer, helped by image stabilisation and an f/2.0 lens (though only at wide angle)- shoots RAW, and has all the controls I need (PASM modes, plus the usual scene modes)- clever controls, such as the dial around the lens make up for a shortage of dedicated buttons- good 720p HD videoCons:- small (so hard to hold well)- short battery life- no focusing and only digital zoom during video- no viewfinder (which would help better framing)- not as fast or responsive as a DSLR (obviously)Competitors like the G12 (which has the same sensor), P7000 and LX5 reduce these drawbacks.  But they're bigger, and would be at home much more often.  Which is why the S95 is the best compromise for me.  Together with a DSLR it does almost all I want, and the overlap (where both work fine) is remarkably big!""
"20110216","5.0","OUSTANDING","Pros:This camera is incredible! Provides outstanding pictures in all sorts of situations. With a tripod, it can take amazing shots at night. Would highly recommend this to someone who is wanting to expand their photo shooting hobby, but not willing to make the jump to SLR yet. For all of you SLR users, this camera will provide an outstanding back-up to your current set-up.Cons:Battery.......i just ended up buying an extra one.""
"20110215","5.0","S95 is top Ranked","I make 11 by 17 enlargements of my shots and usually use a good tripod.  I tested the S95 against a D300 Nikon system with a $2000 lens.  At 11 by 17'  I could not tell the diference.  This is after taking 60 pictures. Some of the pictures had seemed better with the S95.  I decided to sell all my Nikon equipment equipment for $7,000 and put that money in the bank.  Now, my tripod costs more that the S95 camera.""
"20110212","4.0","Size Matters","I bought this camera to take my own pictures at my son's indoor wedding.  Needed good low light performance without flash and something small enough to fit in my pocket. Perfect for that job. I was able to fit the camera with two spare batteries and memory cards in the caselogic tbc-302. Beautiful color.  Lack of zoomable video brings it down from 5 stars (you set the zoom level before shooting, then can't change it while filming).  Nothing better for stills at this size.  If you don't care if it can fit in your pocket, then a micro 4/3 might be more interesting than a larger fixed lens camera point and shoot, like a G12 or LX-5.""
"20110211","4.0","Good balance: size, material, quality","You know it's a great camera, so I'll skip to the chase.PROS:- SIZE.  This camera's compactness can't be underestimated.  The competitors may have better glass, wider angles, and better ergonomics, but they will be bigger.  A 1/4' in depth and 1/2' in length is a huge differnece in your pocket- CONTROLS: Classic Canon UI simplicity.  The ring is a smart move,and you can quickly reassign its functions.- MATERIALS: With a metal shell, this camera can easily take falls and impacts.  I'm confident this can sustain a sidewalk drop and keep going.- IMAGE QUALITY:  You can take photos in dimly lit rooms and still get sharp results.  Cafes, bars, and urban nightlife shots come out very well. I've never had a pocket cam capable of night photography like this one.CONS:- BAD LIVE PREVIEW:  No live preview of exposure changes.  This is very frustrating when trying to stop down 1/3 or up 2... you have to guess, which really makes this a useless feature.  Hopefully Canon will address with a firmware update.- BAD PAINT: While build quality is good, the paint is quite poor.  I stored the camera with my laptop in a bag and the paint rubbed off along the ring and on the corners.  Looks field-tested, but the paint should not rub off this easily.- ERGONOMICS: rear dial jogs very easily, sometime leading to over/under exposed photos.-SPEED: I have owned two Canon SDs and this one has a perceptable shutter lag which shouldn't exist at this price point.  It's not a deal breaker, but I wouldn't use it for action photography.""
"20110209","5.0","Great camera","As a pro-student this is one the best camera in the market,is 100% better that Panasonic Lx5,I just received 5 days ago and am so happy about quality and crisp pictures special low light, i gave 5 stars no doubt about it""
"20110208","3.0","Meh.","The image quality just isn't all that good if you're not taking pictures in bright sunlight.  Surprisingly poor, given all the fantastic reviews.  In street photos shot at dusk, the street asphalt was rendered green.  In a picture of a tree shot at night, the green turned an unnatural neon shade.  Maybe I got a lemon.... (or a lime).I also didn't like that the camera had to bump the ISO to 1600 to take an f2.0 photo in a white, well-lit kitchen at night.  Setting the maximum ISO to 800 should be more than sufficient -- but not for the S95.  In low light in a non-white room, everything looked overwarmed -- sort of orange-tinged.  I dislike flash photos in general, but the S95 seems to require flash in anything less than full daylight.Images from mine were exceedingly noisy.While the Canon S95 is a sweet-looking little camera (and I wanted to love it, I tried to love it, and when I bought it I just knew I WOULD love it), I MUCH prefer the image quality from the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7, and the Panasonic's performance in general.  The S95 has some fun playthings, like color accent, color swap, and miniature mode, which the Panasonic does not have, but image quality is the most important thing to me.I'm sending back the Canon.  Quite possible I got a bad one.""

"20110202","5.0","Best compact bar none","I am a diehard Nikon photo enthusiast, but to my chagrin Nikon has not produced a compact camera to rival this little wonder. This little camera takes pictures that are almost SLR quality. Low light performance is excellent as are focusing speed and accuracy. It also has almost instant startup and almost no shutter delay, it even has a usable 2 FPS frame rate! Although it has an almost SLR like menu of options and adjustable parameters including full manual mode, etc, this are really more for show since the camera's small form factor and controls make it difficult to run it in modes other than full auto and the preset scene modes. That said, its amazing that they are available at all and they work well! Its zooming range is small but the lens works very well throught its range. It has none of the terrible pincushioning and chromatic aberrations of long zoom compact cameras. Even the video mode is well executed and tkes very good 720p video! In its default settings it does try to make up for its inherent limitations by producing slighty oversaturated colors, however, this is easily corrected in the color settings. Its main shortcommings are associated to ergonomics, its simply a small box, thus it doesnt have any real handgrip, its buttons are tiny, and the controls for adjusting its comprehensive manual parameters are the barrel and the small rear control rings making them unconventional and a little hard to use. Also caveat emptor: the camera is fragile while the lens is open. Our daughter 'killed' hers when she dropped it onto a hard surface. All in all, the proof is in the pudding, this its a very small form factor camera that takes excellent pictures even in low light conditions and suffers from none of the usual performnce compromises of compact cameras, it even offers the option of creative photography if you are willing to mess around with its small controls. Only more expensive digital SLRs produce consistently better quality photography and that is probably only noticeable to the critical eye. For a 400 dollar, snapshot size, take anywhere camera, that is high praise indeed. Nikon should be taking notes :)PS: I like it so much I even bought the excellent, full function underwater case for our trip to the caribbean!""

"20110129","3.0","Resolved most but not all S90 issues","This camera is improved over the Canon S90 but there are still some gripes. I owned the Canon S90 but was disappointed with some of its 'features' and sold it. In my S90 review, I complained that the rear dial floated too freely, the surface was too slippery, and there was no HD video. I'm happy to say that the dial is much improved, the surface has more grip, and it now offers HD video. However, some irks remain. The pop up flash resides exactly where your left index finger holds the camera and will sometimes jam if you hold the camera firmly. I complained that the NB-6L battery had a short life (about 220 shots) but in the S95 the battery life is even shorter (about 200 shots). My remaining complaint against the S90 was that because the F2.0 lens allowed for better low-light shooting, it often shot pictures without the flash in situation where it otherwise should have. This led to many noisy (grainy) pictures. It seems that the S95 has improved slightly in this department too.It's not perfect but for its size is a very admirable camera. I hope that the next version of the camera has a fixed flash and a grip. Even a small grip would help immensely, especially for people with large hands. [...]Also, the pocket manual that came with the S90 was very helpful. For the S95, they decided to provide the guide only in PDF format. I'm all for saving trees but this camera has too many features to not include a pocket manual that you can take on the go.""
"20110124","5.0","Excellent Point and Shoot if you want manual control","There are plenty of extensive reviews about this camera and its main competitors, so I will keep my thoughts short.  I bought this camera because I wanted the manual controls and excellent picture quality (for a point and shoot) while still having a very compact camera.  Don't expect it to replace a dSLR in terms of quality, but can't deny the portability of this camera.  If you do not plan on using the manual controls, I would consider a cheaper camera, though even in auto modes this will take good pictures.Update July 2011 :  On a recent 4th of July trip I was hesitant to bring my dSLR with me due to weather, but could easily put this camera in a water proof bag.  I was able to get some good firework shots when the weather cleared that I could not have taken.  The 10 mp has proven enough for decent sized prints (11x14 is the biggest I have printed thus far).  I still highly recommend this camera, and would buy it again if I was shopping for a compact camera today.""

There are a lot of features I have not explored on the camera.I became aware of the camera via an NPR story on electronic Christmas gifts.

I've been wanting a new P+S ever since i handed down my old SD1000 to my sister, who lost hers. This was almost 2 years ago, and at the time i'd been lusting over the S90, but never bit the bullet. One of the main reasons was the exclusion of at least 720p video (I have a 7D and i do mostly video work, so i like to see a good movie mode on a digital camera :p).Glad I waited, as the S95 improved upon the already awesome S90. The texture is better for grip, the rear control wheel has detents (to make it easier to manage and not inadvertently turn it while holding the camera), an HDR scene mode and they included HD (720p) movie mode, among other small improvements. It's pocketable, which is what I wanted, since I don't like carrying around my 7D everywhere, which was often not feasible.It shoots in RAW, which is nice -- and it's great in low light due to the big sensor and fast f/2 lens. at ISO800 and even ISO1600, this thing puts out better pictures than my old SD1000 did at ISO400-500!Flash exposure compensation is nice on this camera, and the dials are really useful for adjusting everything fairly quickly. It's still a compact point and shoot, so I rarely use full manual controls, but leaving it in program works for me most of the time, and I can still adjust the important stuff using the dials and control ring.""
"20110121","5.0","Excellent camera","S95, is a brilliant camera. When I was looking for an advanced PnS my criteria was - great sensor, pocketable build, and great manual control. S95 fit my bill like no other. Since the day I have bought S95 I have been to many hikes and everytime it outperforms my friends' bulky SLRs. May it be ease of use or the bulk factor and even the stills, low end SLRs are no match for S95.Although Canon could have done a much better job with Video recording, HD video quality is not the best I must admit. Also, the positioning of flash sometimes gets on your nerves.Except for these two drawbacks, its a brilliant camera. Definitely recommend to those who like supreme manual controls, super image quality, and fits in your pocket without complaining.""
"20110121","4.0","A few quirks but overall a great camera","Camera is excellent.  Takes great photos.  Great in low-light without flash, much much much better than the SD4500is that I returned.  Feels very solid.  Most of the options you will change are on the back control wheel for easy access, or you can program the control ring or programmable button on the back.  The popup flash can be annoying but if you take a few easy easy precautions it won't be annoying at all.  Small price to pay for such great pictures and manual capabilities.  Video is also really nice, and the stereo sound for the video is really good as well.A few negatives:1)  Popup flash - after only a few days of use I've gotten used to the popup flash, the problem is when you give the camera to someone else to use to take a picture of you or something.  They almost always grab it by the popup flash, and that really makes me worried that someone else is going to ruin my precious camera lol.  I just usually leave the camera on P mode, and leave the flash setting on 'off', so it doesn't popup every time you turn on the camera.  Then if i want the flash to be on it takes like literally 1 second to turn it on using the flash button on the rear of the camera.2)  Control wheel at the top of the camera is sort of annoying.  You need to turn it to get to video mode, etc.  Could have really helped if there was a dedicated button to shoot video.  Anyway its a small concern but could have been better.""

"20110114","4.0","Small, quick and fun","I got this camera as a snapshooter so I don't have to lug around my DSLR to every party. It works great! There is a bit of shutter lag, but not enough that I am missing shots, unlike most other compacts I have used. The combination of image stabilization and an ultra fast f/2.0 lens lets me shoot indoors without a flash, so I avoid that washed-out snapshot look. The Aperture-Priority (Av) and Shutter-Priority (Tv) and two control dials let me get the look I want in my pictures, not the prescribed program that most compacts require, without wading through dozens of menus. Nice job, Canon.The biggest downside is that the autofocus can be a bit erratic. The camera doesn't always accurately focus on the subject and switching to manual focus mode can be a pain because I need to fiddle around with the four-way controller to turn it on, and then the function of the control rings changes. Other minor quibbles are that there is no viewfinder and the camera is so small it can be hard to hold. But don't let any of these reasons stop you from buying this great little shooter.""
"20110113","5.0","Excellent "tween" camera","Guys, this camera rocks. The settings and the features are unlike any that I have seen before. Kick butt feature is the dial on the lens like a SLR camera, but, completely customizable to be any feature you would like, from focus to you name it. another kick butt feature is the color accent which allows you to choose a object and the camera remembers the color, and turns everything else into black and white. so, if you choose blue eyes, and the rest of the persons face would then be black and white, accenting their blue eyes. I went online to try to find this camera, everyone in Illinois was sold out. I had to go to a big box, and have them locate it and ship it to me. I am at DePaul in photography class, and I am telling you this camera does more than I need for this class. I choose not to purchase a $600.00 comparable camera when all I need is this one.

"20110110","4.0","Small and compact without giving up too much quality","Sold as Canon's 'pro' point and shoot, the S95 is a slight upgrade to the S90.  If I owned the S90, I would likely skip the upgrade, but since that wasn't the case, here I am.  The upgrades over the S90 are notable and include a better click ring on the back and upgraded texture, like the 7D, on the body.  I expected better low light capability out of an f2 lens, but it is a P&S camera.  Size and feature are the big selling points for this camera.For the one-bag traveler, this camera is hard to beat.  Small, compact, great daylight photos, decent low-light abilities, and decent battery life.  Throw a 16GB SD card in it and you could shoot thousands of photos without the need to offload them to a computer.  I wish it had a GPS and still better low light capabilities, but for the size, it's hard to beat.If you're looking for a better than average P&S to travel with and ultra-light, one-bag travel is your thing, this might be your answer.""
"20110109","4.0","S95, great but lacks "digital macro"","I've owned a Canon SD800IS for a long time.  Its strengths are the economical size coupled with rich capability -- IMO it's as close as one can come to an SLR as possible without the bulk.  The SD800IS has been with me for many years, many outdoor adventures, and has captured many great pictures with no problems.  It still works well and I intend to keep using it, but we needed a second camera.The S95 seemed a suitable equal and now that I've had a chance to play with it, it's obviously a great device.  For the same price as I paid for the SD800IS many years ago, we now have an S95 with not only more capability to control image capture -- nearly full manual control of focus, aperture and exposure -- but a far superior ability to take low light pictures.  (as well as some other neat stuff with high appeal to the more casual photographer)There is one major omission to the camera's features, and it baffles me as to why Canon didn't program this into the S95.  There doesn't seem to be what they call a 'digital macro' setting; that is, a setting that allows extremely close-up photos.  On the SD800IS, I can slip the camera into digital macro mode and take pictures of amazing things I can never see with my naked eye.  For example, I've captured rock crystals, fabric threads, lichen leaves, dew drops, leaf hair, and pin-head sized bugs far better than any other point-and-shoot camera I've ever owned.  Great fun!  Probably 20% of my photos with the SD800IS used digital macro.Not so on the S95.  Yes, using the S95's regular macro mode and then zooming the pictures in a photoshop program will probably achieve similar results -- given the S95's quality lens and sensor -- but it's really not the same as having the ability to see how the picture is framed and focused in the moment you take it.Canon, I'm a loyal consumer, but if you don't offer digital macro, I'm going to have to find another company.Another thing.  One reviewer complained about the flash popping up, hitting his finger, getting stuck, and then he has to restart the camera each time this happens.  This happened to me too, but repeated restarts did not clear the error.  I had to first push the flash down into the body, then it restarted OK.  Ick.  This seems pretty clunky; there must be a better way to handle this.  However, I'm not going to return the camera for this, simply because we don't like taking photos with the flash anyway -- and thank goodness for it's low light prowess!Lastly, we ordered a PSC-3200 case for this camera and it fits OK.""

"20110108","5.0","Way beyond normal point & shoot camera","Researched the Canon S95 and read so many glowing reports that it was the one to buy. I shoot with the Nikon D90 SLR usually but was in need for something more portable. Was initially looking into the Panasonic Lumic FZ35 because of its zoom range and its relatively small size---scrutinized various sites downloading images from both the S95 and the Z35 and saw clearly that the S95 image quality was superior especially in shadow areas and low light. I had to finally ask myself whether a camera like the Lumix FZ35 which although compact and light was truly portable--it is not--If I need to sling something over my neck thats why I have my Nikon SLR which obviously has better image quality and a great collection of lenses for every conceivable situation, The Canon S95 is truly pocketable easily fitting into a pants pocket--what I was amazed at was the absolutely stunning image quality--I have done a variety of photographic tests and can attest that it is an amazing camera with tremendous flexibilty.My opinion is this-if you really value portability dont bother with smaller non-pocketable cameras when something like the canon s95 exists---it can easily go toe to toe with my Nikon D90 in many situations and in some areas rivals that SLR. Never thought I would be able to say that--could not be more pleased---dont bother second guessing--I and many others have done that for you already.""
"20110106","5.0","Rivals DSLR Pics in Certain lighting situations","This is a wonderful little camera that blows every point and shoot digital camera on the market (as of January 2011) out of the water.  I've owned 4 point and shoots in my lifetime, three of them were sony cybershots and one was a canon powershot SD1100, but this one consistently takes crystal clear images unlike other point and shoots.  Plus it has much higher ISO settings than any other point and shoot I've every seen which enables it to take better low light shots, and the noise reduction on it isn't to bad.  There have been times when I've taken photos side by side with my Nikon d300s and this thing rivaled the quality in normal outdoor lighting conditions.  The camera also offers multiple scene modes to choose from.  overall, great bang for your buck and if you're looking for a a great camera but don't want to make the DSLR investment or you're looking for a camera to substitute your DSLR when you don't feel like lugging it around all day on an outdoor trip with the family, go with this camera.  for those who think the price on it is to high, the old saying goes 'you get what you pay for'.  you'll never get photos as good as these on a cheaper 150 dollar point and shoot.  oh, and one more thing, you can shoot in RAW with this camera which is a feature rarely offered in point and shoots. the HD video quality in normal lighting conditions is so good that I've shot video clips alongside my Canon VIXIA HF S10 HD Camcorder and was stunned of how similar they were in quality.  overall, no complaints.  stop waiting and buy the thing""
"20110104","5.0","Best compact camera yet","This is the best compact camera I've bought yet. It's not an SLR replacement, though it's a great alternative to the bulkier Canon G10/11/12 series.The construction quality is slightly shabby for the price (plastic, loose fitting dials etc) but it certainly doesn't feel like it's about to fall apart.Image quality, low light performance and manual controls are far better than any other Canon Elph series compact I've tried.""
"20110104","5.0","5 stars for the camera. 1 star for price gouging","This is probably the best camera you will find in a pocket-sized point and shoot. The ability to manually control the camera is extra icing on the cake if you want something more than the limits of a fully automatic camera. My choices were narrowed to this camera the Lumix LX and the Canon G12 as an alternative to my DSLR rig. I wanted something I could always have with me when the DSLR wasn't practical. Any of the 3 cameras is a good choice but the S95 is the only truly pocketable camera. Just keep in mind, this is not a DSLR and as such will have some limitations.My one and only complaint is the price gouging on Amazon for this high-demand item. This camera can be found for about $369.00 but starting around Christmas time it's listed as high as $450 through some of Amazon's third-party sellers when Amazon's supply is depleted. This is offered as opposed to the choice to backorder the camera at $369.00. Sad to see Amazon treating their customers this way. I suppose they are within their rights to charge what the market will allow, just be aware that the MSRP of this camera is $399.00.""
"20110104","5.0","The best compact camera on the market!","Simply said, the S95 is the best compact camera on the market today.  If you want a powerhouse that will provide fantastic image quality and manual control but will fit into your pocket, look no further.I am a professional photographer, and I recently used my new S95 as a backup to my Canon 7D DSLR on a 4 day trip to San Francisco, and I was absolutely impressed.  Looking back at my images at a usable resolution (not 100% pixel peeping) I usually can't tell the difference between my $350 S95 and my $2000 7D with 15-85mm lens.  Of course, if I zoom in to 100% then the S95 definitely is noisier, less sharp, has more chromatic aberration, etc.  But it's all a reasonable compromise for the portability.The hardware is metal and rock-solid.  The controls are easy and intuitive to use, though there's a little bit of a delay compared to my DSLR.  The ability to shoot RAW is a godsend when editing photos.The S95 is the perfect backup to any DSLR.  Often I find that I don't carry my DSLR around because it's too bulky or I'm afraid of losing it.  This S95 is perfect!""

"20110102","4.0","Compact camera with all the options","I purchesed this as it had all the adjustments on a compact camera that included aperture priority and shutter priority mode. In auto mode the pictures are going to look like pretty much like any other cannon compact camera. However, I can get better shots in AV (aperture priority) mode down to F2 and was able to make adjustments for bad lighting situations when setting up family photos on a tripod. It also has a low light mode that is way better than the auto flash compact cams but can still be hit or miss. It also has a nice little selection of scene modes. I haven't be able to try out all but like the HDR and panoramic options. The picture speed is quick in no flash and a bit faster than my old cannon elf with flash. I purchased a 15mb/s SD card and writing speed doesn't seem to be much of an issue except with HDR.Adjustments are the best they can be for a small camera and it takes a little bit to get used to not putting your finger where the flash is. Exposure is always easy to adjust and useful. The documentation of the camera outlines the features but will not help you select based on situation.I was going to initially purchase an SLR but needed something smaller and figured that since this camera had all the manual adjustments I may not need an SLR. I like the camera and would purchase it again due to it's compactness and photo quality and adjustments. However, it does not take the place of an SLR as my friends photos always come out better and fast in SLR auto mode.""

"20110102","4.0","Great Little Camera","I bought and used both the S95 and the new Panasonic LX5 and liked them both; each had comparable features and great images for the size.  However, the S95 won out as the keeper because of its smaller size (thus actually pocketable for me) and its retractable lens cover.  The LX5 was just that much larger so that it was too bulky to fit comfortably in my jacket pocket and the removable lens cap was a real bother.  A street camera needs to be quick to the eye and removing (or remembering to remove it in the first place) the lens cap just added another delaying step to the process.  Canon learned a number of lessons with their S90 and the improvements to the S95 show that they can learn.  The Cons: I will repeat the lamentation of so many other reviewers - Give me back the paper manual!  A short sighted cost saving measure on Canon's part as it may prevent the customer from using the the most of all of its features.  The included Canon RAW software is still awkward to use and I do use RAW a lot so I will have to upgrade my other software.  Maybe Canon can drop the inadequate software and restore the manual.  Listen up, Canon!Both are great cameras, either one is a good choice, but the camera that you like to use the most is the best choice.""
"20110101","5.0","Great Advanced Compact","I have owned many compact digital cameras from Canon, Sony, and Nikon.  Most have been good for their size, but with the usual trade-offs in image quality, low-light capability, and manual control flexibility.  Finally, the Canon S95 comes along.  This is a serious camera with a reasonable set of trade-offs: low flash power, limited zoom range, and a few other minor issues shared by all other compact cameras.  The S95 has the characteristics I want: great usability, good image quality in a variety of lighting conditions, RAW/JPG image capabilities, minimal shutter lag, good metering, and flexible manual controls.Yes, it does cost a bit more than most other compact digital cameras.  However, this camera should be compared to more expensive digital cameras such as the Canon G12 and Nikon P7000 (I'm sure that statement will raise eyebrows among some fans of those cameras).  Candidly, I like both of those cameras as well, but neither of them can be carried easily in a jacket pocket.  The S95 delivers comparable image quality in a much smaller package.  Of course, you may opt for the other cameras because you want features that aren't included in the S95 (e.g. hot shoe, wireless flash capability).It's worth mentioning I'm not totally biased toward Canon -- My DSLRs are all Nikon bodies.  Although I like the Nikon P7000, the Canon S95 is just what I need in terms of features, quality, size, and price.  When I want to carry a full-featured body, I'll always choose one of my Nikon DSLRs.""

The camera is amazimg.  The quaility of the photos are amazing.  Whining about the video feature is amazing.  Buy a camcprder if you want to shoot video.  Buy this camera id you want great looking stills!""
"20110101","4.0","Great camera with limitations","I've had the S95 for about a month now and while it is one of the best compact cameras on the market today, I will be returning mine due to 10-15 dead pixels on the screen. No fault of the Camera itself, these things happen, but in addition to the dead pixels, I have other issue with the camera which I shall explain further.Let's jump straight in to the pros and cons, in no particular order.pros:1. compact size.2. excellent image quality, very sharp.3. manual controls, if you are looking for a camera that will help you improve and grow your understanding of manual photography, this is a great place to start.4. f/2.0 aperture = great for low light.5. nice 3' LCD, bright and clear.cons:1. SPEED. I made the mistake in buying this camera when I should have bought a DSLR. it's not the S95's fault, it was mine for not testing the camera out in a shop before buying, I thought it would meet my needs, but I was wrong. If you are intending to use this for stop action photography, meaning kids and pets, think again. While it will take great images, it will not take them when you want. There is a slight delay. By the time you half press the shutter, auto focus, and then take the shot, the moment is long gone. So expect to take around 10 shots of your kids on the swings to find 1 image that is a keeper. I didn't expect DSLR like speeds, but the S95 really doesn't offer anything different compared to my 3 year old Canon SD6300 6MP camera, in terms of speed.2. Flash location, I'm sure everyone knows by now that it's in a terrible spot.3. Movie recording is pretty much useless on the S95. No autofocus or optical zoom means that you either have to shoot a static subject or forget about recording movies altogether. I downloaded the CHDK hack for the S95 which lets you autofocus and zoom optically in movie mode but even that is not ideal as you have to boot up the camera in playback mode, update the firmware, then switch to live mode to record a movie. It get's on my nerves having to do this every time. It's 2010 for god's sake. Camera 5 years old used to autofocus and zoom optically in movie modes.4. Battery life is poor. 200 pics is just not enough, so if you get this camera, get a couple spares.conclusion:All in all, the S95 is a great compact camera. I have definitely taken many keepers in the last month. The images are very high quality and sharp for a camera of this size. And while it didn't meet my needs in a camera, it is no fault of the camera. Just be sure you understand its limitations before buying it. It is not a fast camera, you have to pace yourself when shooting, and I've already explain why video recording is a pain with this camera for anything other than still subjects. But for everything else (portraits, landscapes, still life, etc) this camera is probably the best compact on the market today. I know the LX5 and others are better technically, but they are not as compact as the S95 and thus is the reason why the S95 is so popular.So as long as things like the slow operational speed and limited movie mode don't bother you (other cons like flash location and battery life can be worked around, not a deal breaker) then I think you will really enjoy this camera, especially if you are looking for a compact camera to help you understand photography better and move away from the green auto mode.""
"20110101","5.0","Probably the best in picture quality among compact digicams","I'll keep this review short.  If you want a compact (non-bridge and non-DSLR) camera that takes *great* pictures, this is it.A semi-pro friend of mine recently showed me his new S95, his first compact digital camera, and called it the next best thing to his arsenal of digital SLRs and lenses. He showed me some indoor and outdoor shots and I was immediately hooked and ordered my own.  While the resolution is 'only' 10MP (I've never been a pixel junkie myself), the picture quality rivals that of many consumer-grade DSLRs from just a few years ago.  It has full manual controls and feels lightweight and solidly built.  The 720p video mode is very good.  While the optical zoom is only 3.8x, I think the lens is of such high quality which explains the great picture quality, as well as high price.If you're fed up with disappoining picture quality from your digicam, or want a compact model that takes excellent pictures, the S95 is most likely the one you've been looking for.""

I have many DSLR cameras and equipment. The Canon S95 is very easy to use and intuitive. It also has many advanced features that will make any dslr user feel at home. The biggest draw back for me was the shooting speed, but too be honest it is faster than any other Point N Shoot I have shot with, just slow in caparison to a dslr. The only minor draw back was the battery life, I only got around 100 to 200 with flash and about 200 to 300 with out. So make sure you are always fully charged before you go anywhere.

Although the camera is a bit pricey, the quality of the picture is exceptional. The size is convenient to carry around and the camera is 'made in japan' which gives me more assurance on the quality of the product.  The one draw back is the position of the flash on the camera. This is a pop up flash camera and it is located on the top left hand side where you normally hold the camera.  The camera does 'not' come with a users manual and I think if I'm paying $300, I would like to receive a well written small manual with basic commands well explained.  Although there is a CD that came with it, I had to go and download this from the website and print it myself !  Some of the logos for camera adjustments are not intuitive.

"20101224","5.0","Awesome Camera","I have replaced a Canon SD500 (7.1 Mpix) with this puppy... I am an avid shooter, I own a Canon 50D dSLR, I have been a Canon owner for quite some time (G3, G4, G5, Pro1, 20D, 40D, 50D, SD500 - and now, s95).I took it for a test run on a nightly outing to Boston... I have to say that I had little expectations for a pocket camera. After all, the P&S category, generally, leaves a lot to be desired. This one, literally, blew my mind. Out of 80 shots that I brought home, 75 were keepers. Keep in mind, I used the camera at night, hand-held, at 30 degree outside temperature, no flash...I am sure, if you did the pixel level analysis, you would be able to come up with some flaws. I am sure that if you compared it to a real dSLR, with an L-quality lens, you would be able to find some flaws. But for what it does - being a dSLR shooter - I will call this a serious dSLR backup candidate. Quality - awesome. Imagie stabilization - awesome. Handheld, 1/4 second sharp? Seriously, not many cameras can do that. And P&S? I do not think you can get any to perform...Movies? Awesome quality. My only gripe is that they are not in MOV format (from AVI that my sd500 used to do), and Microsoft Movie Maker does not handle these... But then again, for good compression ratio and for 720p, I am willing to forego some of the editing capabilities. As for the ability to focus while shooting the movie - the camera's depth of field handles it fine under most occasions. And with regards to the zoom while shooting, you can tele- in, but you cannot go wider than what you have started from. Keep in mind, this is not a video camera... If you are into creating professional movies, look elsewhere. If you need the movie capabilities, the camera will do just fine - and take AWESOME pictures while at it :)""
"20101222","2.0","Review: Canon S95 vs. Nikon S8100","I just tried both these models for 2 days - borrowed it from a friend (Thanks Jig!).  I've owned Canons for about 10 years (SLRs, P&S models), and have been looking for a P&S camera that would take good videos - especially indoors - have low light sensitivity and have a big zoom (at least 7x or higher).  Here are my comparison points - both are quite disappointing with pluses showing strengths and minuses showing weaknesses/issues.  You decide what works for you based on your requirements.  I'm keeping price out as a comparison datapoint.Nikon S8100 Review+ Superb resolution of screen+ Can zoom while shooting video (in and out) - the camera retains focus - slow, but gets there - indoors has a lot of trouble finding focus while zooming in/out- Videos inside the house even with many light bulbs on are very dark - almost unusable at times - poor quality+ Colors both inside and outside in light are very accurate - much more than S95+ 10x is a fantastic zoom for shooting stills or videos- battery life poor- no external charger - have to connect it to computer to charge (do they sell separate charger?)+ flash is one of the brightest I've seen in a Point and Shoot - excellent!+ Press a button for shooting video - ever ready mode- Pressing the record button to 'stop' recording takes a while- Camera crashed on me once with an error message - I had to remove battery to reboot- Can hear all sorts of motor noises/sounds while camera is even trying to find focus - when you zoom in/out, you can hear motor sounds+ even though its not a fast lens (f2.0), the low light sensitivity is quite good - must be the CMOS sensorCanon S95 Review- Overall underwhelmed by this camera - I've been a big fan (and prior owner) of the S series and have owned 2 Canon SLR's+ Good low light sensitivity to pictures indoors+ Videos indoors are very usable due to sensitivity of sensor- Garish colors at times - I can't believe a camera with the internals of the G12 is confused with colors in the Auto WB setting- Poor resolution of screen compared to Nikon (half the resolution)- Poor job of color accuracy - struggles with CF bulbs and cloudy skies - too much yellow or blue tints+ can shoot in RAW hence can do lossless editing in Lightroom or Photoshop- big negative - can't keep focus once you start zooming in while shooting a video- separate dial mode to get to for shooting video+ zooming in and out are slow but can't hear motor sounds while shooting video- 4x is minor zoom - most cameras have a lot more these days""

Finally in 2010, after so much research and waiting, we found Canon Powershot S95 which is almost perfect according to my requirements.

It's just not convenient to take it with me everywhere.I've been looking for a high quality compact camera which I could have with me wherever I go and it looks like I found it. All the modes and features this thing has are great. I love that you can manually focus with this camera. The control ring on front you can also program for various modes. You can have it set for manual focus, exposure, ISO, White Balance, etc. The one mode which I found doesn't work too well was the fireworks mode. Keeps the shutter open to long.This has a Super Vivid mode which really makes the colors pop. No need to do the contrast curve in Photoshop! The only problem is that it is a shooting mode, not a setting which can be used while in other modes. This limits when you can actually use it!I've never seen a compact camera so good in low light conditions. It still doesn't really compare to a DSLR in that regard, but try to find a compact that does.One of the best features of this camera is the movie mode. This has TWO microphones on the front of the camera. When you play these movies back with decent speakers, the sound is amazing! This is a camera which fits into your pocket (while in a soft case) and is capable of shooting good movies with good sound.The stitch assist mode works pretty well. Let's you line up your panoramic shots as you shoot them. Photoshop merges them effortlessly. The Canon software that comes with it isn't quite as good.You don't have the excuse now for why you missed good opportunities because you didn't bring your camera!""

This is why I bought the camera and it is GREAT for that.Love the control ring and wealth of manual controls.Image quality is good.Biggest negative is that it is hard to hold - no natural place to put your hand.  It's easy to leave my finger on top of the flash and block it from coming up.  Control ring on the back does still move a little too easily since it tends to be under my thumb when holding the camera.And flash pictures are not the greatest.But I can live with the problems to get the low light capabilities.""

"20101215","1.0","Very poorly assembled","I have purchased this camera twice. The first one had a problem with the LCD glass. Two corners of the glass were not glued to the body, the glass moved at my finger touch. This was a very visible defect since the glass was protruding at the corners not properly glued. Looked to me like the glass may fall loose anytime. This camera was returned.I have ordered another camera from a different store and this one still have the one corner of the LCD glass unglued and loose like the first camera. This second camera had also another issue: there is a big gap on the side join of the front and back panels. This gap was around 0.3 mm, which is way too much for this kind of equipment, since there should be no gap at all.Overall, the S95 is a very well designed camera, but very poorly assembled. It is a shame  for a 'Made in Japan' camera...""

"20120223","5.0","Niche camera-perfect for my serious side-not tossable","I must begin by saying that I own and use a Nikon professional DSLR.  I use prime lenses and occasionally a stabilized zoom and I am not bothered by the size and weight of my camera equipment.  That said, I only take it with me to 'on purpose' events and do not use it for 'snapshots'. I have and enjoy a Canon SX100is and it has served me well without a single complaint.  I bought the S95 to supplement my other cameras and I must admit, to satisfy my ego and my curiosity.  I have experimented with it within the last month and I do enjoy the performance of this little camera.  I like the option of using it as a creative camera, rather than a point and shoot on the green auto setting. I do not shoot video, ever. I can't understand peoples' obsession with short video clips and would use a real video camera if I was that into it. I did want a camera that I can be a little less careful with.  I hoped to free myself a bit from guarding the camera and have something to 'toss around' like so many others do. I failed at that one.  The S95 is not tossable.  I guard it like every thing else I own. It's just too nice to rough up.  I should have known better.I purchased this camera instead of the Canon Elph 300HS.  It was a tough call as the 300HS is an excellent pocket camera and it is much lighter and smaller than the S95.  And yes it is probably 'tossable'.  I do not shoot RAW and do not have a reason to.  My purchase came down to one deciding factor, the lens.  At it's most wide angle, the S95 has a f2 lens, vs the f2.7 of the 300HS and the 2.8 of my SX100.  That is a full stop and that is huge.  It may not seem like much, but it allows me to use the S95 inside any reasonably well lit space without a flash.  That is often the difference between a photograph and nothing.  My primary purpose for this camera is taking photos at indoor family events and a flash is often intrusive.  I decided that this feature alone was worth double the price of the Elph 300HS.  I also could afford it.  If money was a bigger issue, I would have bought the 300HS for myself and been perfectly happy with it.  I bought a red 300HS for my niece for XMAS 2011 and she is thrilled with it. For typical outdoor photos, either camera will perform well.The S95 is not double the camera.  It works for me as I use it.  I believe that those disappointed in it have unreasonable expectations.  It is better.  If you can afford it, buy it or buy the S100.  You will love it. If not don't sweat it.  Buy what you can comfortably afford and don't forget to use your camera.  No camera will take wonderful photographs.  Only you can do that. Enjoy whatever camera you own and use it often.  And always bring a camera with you.""

But the compact nature of this camera and it's ability to give me 85% of what I want and need while traveling has put my SLRs in the backseat.

I could have lived with all of that if the image quality was better. It was hit and miss. Sometimes great and sometimes lousy, with the main problem being over-exposed.  Amazon was great about letting me return it - will probably go with the Canon G12.Have since purchased and received the Canon G12 from Amazon.

The quality of image, features and flexibility (I use the lens ring for exposure compensation) are wonderful. Battery life is somewhat mediocre compared to G11 or other point and shoots, but you'd want a spare battery anyway.I have gotten the dreaded lens error message, which has got me worried. This seems endemic to Canon cameras, but its fatal when it happens.  Camera simply refuses to extend lens, and gives you the E18 Lens Error message. It went away, but do you trust it to be your 'only' camera on a once-in-a-lifetime trip?""
"20101213","5.0","Great pictures and low-light performance","This camera seems to have incredible intelligence in determining exposure levels.  Low light performance is outstanding, though you may have to accept substantial reduction in resolution to take pictures in exceptionally dim conditions.  I'm very comfortable using it in place of my Rebel XSi SLR when I want something easy to carry in my pocket.""
"20101212","5.0","It's really what I want!","I bought it for replacing my old Fuji f50fd.  The image quality of f50fd is good, but at low light,it's performance really made me disappointed.  I searched through websites, read hundreds of reviews, comparing prices thousand of times.  Finally, I was wavering between 2 cameras: Canon s95 and Panasonic Lumix LX5; I like the portable size, no lens cover and HD video for S95, but the wide angle and the design of LX5 is also really attracting me.  If you are good at finding good deals, the price between this two cameras actually is not much, usually is under $30.  To me, it's not a big difference if I really want to buy a good camera for me.  If it's over $60 difference, I may think to get the cheaper one, but it's not.  Eventually, I decided to get Canon S95 because I prefer carrying the camera in my pocket.  I compared the size carefully,read many reviews, then I think LX5 is really not that good for pocket, the lens actually bothers people.  More over, at portrait mode, Canon camera can take wormer pictures than Panasonic one, that's also what I'm looking for.  I prefer taking pictures for people with scenes to taking only the scene.  When I got the camera, the image quality is really much better than my previous one, and the HD video mode is really nice.  Can't refocusing during recording may be a problem to some people, but to me it's fine.  Some people also mentioned tht the popping-up flash light may bother people, but I think if you are a careful person, it won't really be a problem, especially after you getting familiar with your camera.  I recommend this camera.""
"20101212","5.0","Great Camera!","We purchased this camera for a business and our company just loves it.  It is easy to use with excellent picture quality.  The low light setting makes a huge difference in our pictures.  I plan on purchasing one for myself personally.""
"20101212","5.0","This does everything I've wanted it to do.","My high-end camera is a Canon 5DMII, but I often find that it's not really practical to pack around on vacations or on local walks.  I wanted to pick up a good quality pocket camera that I could use for those times that I wanted to travel light.This camera has been absolutely wonderful so far.  The quality of the shots I'm getting from it are good enough that I am considering leaving the 5D at home in more situations.  We picked ours up just before a family trip to Disneyland so that my wife and I wouldn't be fighting over her camera (since I didn't want to be lugging the 5D all around Disneyland).  We were both blown away with the quality of the low-light shots we were able to get with such a small camera.  An example of some of the shots we were able to capture with this camera can be found in the following webshots album: [...]Pros: * Does real well in low light. * Can save photos in RAW mode for later fine-tuning. * Full manual controls * Great control ring around the lens (I find it most useful for controlling the zoom) * Incredibly portable (no trouble at all packing this camera around)Cons: * The only downside to this camera is the speed at which it takes/saves photos.  It seemed as if I went from 3.9shots/second with the 5D to 1shot/3.9seconds with the S95 ;).  It forced me to wait for the best angle/shot instead of snapping off an early insurance shot like I tend to do with my 5D.  Not a killer, but it did cause me to miss some good shots during my early experiments.""
"20101211","4.0","Close To Fantastic, but some annoying shortcomings","I've used this camera for a week now and it has a lot of features I really like a lot, in fact in many ways this camera is spectacular.PROS1) Great image quality and color for a compact camera.  I own the Canon SD450, Panasonic DMC-TZ5, and Casio EX-FC100 and I prefer slightly punchy way Canon's render color compared to other digital cameras.  10 megapixels on the S95 is plenty of megapixels and shots look very good at the pixel level so you have enough resolution for large prints.2) Spectacular low light capability compared to other compact cameras.  I usually leave the flash turned off because the shots turn out great without it.  In 3 megapixel low light mode you can snap hand held shots in the dark that you won't believe - the camera will see way more than your eyes can.  In dim light you can take good looking HD videos.  If I take the same low-light video shots with my Panasonic DMC-TZ5 they look dark and grainy.3) Great compact size.  Can put in any pocket no problem.4) GREAT lens design choice.  Fast 2.0 28 mm wide angle is wonderful.  3.8x zoom while somewhat limited, but keeps the camera size/weight low.  I'd MUCH rather have this lens than a lower aperture (slower) but longer zooming lens because I deal with low light WAY more often than I need 10x zoom.5) HD movies look great - though the slow 24 frame per second means you have to be careful about moving the camera as you shoot.6) Stereo sounds quality for movies is really good.  Camera does a good job auto-adjusting recording levels to give good sounding results.  I recorded a school concert and it sounds great in stereo.7) Looks good and finish texture makes it easy to hold on to8) Lots of controls - fun to play with.9) The flash is pretty strong for a compact camera if you want to use it.CONS1) Only digital zoom during movie shooting, no optical zoom either manual or powered.  Digital zoom of course makes the video look crappy so it's basically useless.2) No auto-focus during movie shooting.  Limits what you can do in a single clip.3) Manual zoom JUMPS from one focal length to another - you can't get in-between focal lengths.  Other controls like aperture also JUMP from one setting to the next.  I can't figure out why you'd have a huge manual control ring that could give you fantastic manual control, and then ruin it by making is so jumpy and discreet.  This makes the camera feel cheap.4) In movie mode in low light, camera JUMPS in brightness  - aperture doesn't smoothly change, it JUMPS is a very visible way.  Very distracting and annoying in the output video.5) Wrist strap doesn't have the adjustable ring to keep the camera tightly attached to your wrist.  This can't cost more than a penny - it's amazing a $366 camera is missing this obvious feature that will keep you from dropping this expensive camera.6) 24 frames/second video is pretty slow.  You have to be very slow about panning the camera to avoid poor looking jittery shots.  This camera really should have 30 fps or even 60 fps movie options.7) Ergonomics could be better.  I have pretty large hands, amazingly the designers have put the shutter button about 1/3 inch too far to the left to make this camera easily usable with just your right hand.  You have to STRETCH your index finger to reach the shutter button.  If you have small hands there's no way you could shoot with one hand!!  I guess I'll get used to it, but I've missed several shots because I'm pressing down where the shutter button isn't. This is a significant problem.8) Very minor issue: Holding the camera with 2 hands is also a little awkward - if you use the flash because the flash pops up under the most natural place to place your left index finger.  This is minor because I mostly leave the flash off and would rather shoot with one hand anyway.CONCLUSIONI'm a bit mystified how the Canon designers could get so many important features right with this camera, but screw up so many details that my 2 year old Panasonic TMZ-TZ5 managed to get right.  At $366 it's very disappointing to have so many shortcomings.  However,  what this camera does well, it does REALLY well so I'm going to hold on to it and overall I'm very happy with it.  If you need a really good compact camera now  - I'd definitely buy it.  No need to lug a large camera around because this small camera will handle 98% of your still shooting needs very well.  However, I sure hope the next version of this camera fixes the list of shortcomings, because this camera has the potential to be other-worldly fantastic when it's gets these issues fixed.  Even 2 year old cameras that cost half as much manage to get these shortcomings right.""

"20101206","4.0","Very good, but with a couple minor knocks ...","This is likely about my 10th Canon camera I've purchased over the years and as far as the non-SLR's, takes the best pics overall.  My only knocks are that A)One of the reasons I purchased this camera is because of the 'low light' mode on the dial.  Takes good enough pics but it's locked at the 'M' picture size setting which is only 2.5 MP's.  You CAN'T take full 10 MP pics in the 'low light' mode.  The other knock as others have mentioned is the flash pop up is in absolutely the WORST possible place it could be. It's exactly where your left index finger is supposed to hold and steady the camera.  Takes a lot of getting used to.Other than that, I swear by Canon cameras and never had any major problems with any over the years.""
"20101206","4.0","Awesome camera, but menus annoyingly slow","My Powershot S95 is an upgrade from a Powershot SD700IS, and overall I am very impressed. Especially the low-light performance is excellent. I was out taking pictures of my back yard at dusk, with no tripod and no flash, and with a +2/3 exposure compensation, it looked almost like daylight. I tried the same shot with my SD700IS (and another subcompact I was auditioning, with a smaller sensor and aperture) and neither came close to the amount of detail and clarity I got from the S95.  Since I don't like using flash unless it's absolutely necessary, there are a lot of times when performance under limited lighting conditions is important.I have many of the same gripes that others have mentioned in this forum, but most of them feel pretty minor to me. I've gotten used to holding it so my finger doesn't get in the way of the flash. And I'm already used to no auto-focus or optical zoom during movies, since the SD700IS did neither of those either.  Sure, I would prefer that it did those things, but I don't strictly *need* it to.  As far as I can tell after many hours of research (and auditioning a few candidates), this is the best subcompact camera you can buy at any price.  (I've read reviews of the Panasonic DMC-LX5, which sounds great; but it's not in the same size class, and is just too big for me to consider.)But my one serious gripe is a pretty big one: its lack of responsiveness to user input. For example, say you want to toggle the flash between Auto and Off, which I seem to do frequently (since this camera, like most others, often seems to want to flash under inappropriate circumstances). You push a key to bring up the menu, and then another key to cycle through the choices, and when you pause for a second or two, it accepts the setting you have stopped on. On my SD700IS, each key press was handled instantly, so once you're familiar with it, you could do it very quickly, and almost without looking. On the S95, it slides the menu into view, and this takes, I dunno, maybe 3/4 second. (It seems like an eternity, but I haven't measured it, this is just a guess.) And here's the kicker: IT DROPS ANY BUTTON PRESSES WHICH OCCUR WHILE IT'S ANIMATING THE MENU. So not only is it slower to operate, but also I have to pay more attention to it, so I can notice when it is ready to accept my next button press. What the heck?!I find this particularly disappointing, since it's a regression compared to a 4+ year-old camera from the same manufacturer. I find this particularly frustrating, because it seems like an arbitrary design choice they made, rather than some inherent limitation of the hardware (like, say, auto-focus speed). And I find it particularly surprising, since the S95 seems targetted at more sophisticated users, who are more likely to frown on fluffy menu animations, and just want something that works quickly with no fuss. I'm sure somebody thought this would look slick, and maybe it does to some. Who knows, maybe it even helps usability for some inexperienced users (though I doubt it). But THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF. I have skimmed the entire manual, and walked all the config screens looking for it, but no dice. Even if the setting was buried deep in their config menus, that would have been enough for me. I'd only have to find it once.The other thing is that it pops up or retracts the flash as you cycle over the options, and this again causes a brief delay before you can move on to the next item. Besides making it slower, if you skip over your desired selection by accident, it may end up having to move the flash again, which causes more delay, and I don't like the idea of extra wear and tear on the mechanism. I suppose some usability guy thought it was better feedback to move the flash immediately, but I think this is too high of a price to pay, and seeing the highlight move between the selections on the LCD screen is perfectly adequate feedback.Some may pooh-pooh the importance of these seemingly short delays. I'm probably going to live for 77.6 years, so what's 3/4 second now and then? But anyone with kids or pets knows that every microsecond is crucial when you're trying to capture a moment. We have 15 cute chickens in the back yard, and they do not stop to pose for shots! Sure, you could say (and some have) that if I need super-quick responses, I should get a DSLR. But I must have a subcompact regardless, to take on trips, and I don't really want to spend an extra $500+ to own a DSLR on top of this. And besides this menu thing, I think the S95 is adequately responsive -- I've lived with the SD700IS for a few years, and have gotten used to it. The S95 is annoyingly close to being the perfect camera (for me).One last (unrelated) thing: I'm not sure why the auto-ISO selects such a high value sometimes. Recently it selected a high-enough ISO for there to be some quality degradation (I forget what it was, maybe 640 or something), and the exposure speed was 1/320th of a second, or something really quick. I'm no photography expert, and I may just be exposing my ignorance here -- but couldn't it have selected a lower ISO, with an exposure that was correspondingly slower, but still fast enough to avoid blurring from camera shake? Yes, there is a setting for this exact thing: how quickly it kicks up the auto-ISO. I tried changing it from 'normal' to 'low', and it did better in some cases; but in other cases, it didn't kick it up enough, and it selected an ISO so low that it needed an exposure so slow that it gave me the camera shake warning. So neither 'low' nor 'normal' is good for all circumstances. Why can't it just start with an exposure quick enough to not worry about shaking, and then choose whatever ISO is appropriate for that? (at least within some reasonable range of circumstances)  Yes, of course you can set the ISO manually, or use shutter speed priorty, and I have started doing just that -- but often I don't have time to fiddle with those settings, and it seems like its auto mode could be smarter about this stuff.I'm keeping it anyway, since (as long as you pay attention to the settings it's choosing, and sometimes override them) nothing else can touch it for image quality + compactness, and I generally like the Canon interface (other than the particular design blunder I've been ranting about). But I really really hope that Canon decides to fix the menu animations in a firmware update or something. And by fixing it, I mean adding an option to turn off the animations, or scrapping them altogether.""

Great pictures, easy controls, and features not found in most point and shoots!Cons:  It takes a while to get used to the flash popping up where a lot of people hold the camera...practice makes perfect!""
"20101204","4.0","Excellent high end pocket camera","I was looking for a high quality pocket camera that could shoot without flash in low light, and the S95 definitely fits the bill.  It has an ISO 3200 low light mode that I used to take some amazingly crisp pictures at night, where the only source of light was ambient urban.  The other strengths of this camera are well described by other reviewers, but include compact size, bright and sharp screen, great color (though at times a little too punchy), and fairly logical and easy to use controls.  The images are generally sharp, though a little less than what I get with a Nikon D40 SLR.  This is only detectable when images are massively enlarged on the computer screen, and may not be relevant for most prints.  I found 4 x 6 prints, for example, to look comparable with the two cameras, and would anticipate similar results for 8 x 10 prints.  The shortcomings are a short battery life, exacerbated by a misleading battery life indicator that goes from full to near-dead in an instant, the lack of a viewfinder, and (at least compared with the D40) relative slowness to meter and shoot.Overall, this is an outstanding camera for someone who wants excellent pictures, the ability to program a wide range of settings, all in a compact format.  It is an excellent choice to for the SLR user who wants an alternative to lugging a bulky camera, but still wants some control in shooting and high quality images.""
"20101204","4.0","great camera with a marginal battery","Great alternative when i don't want to lug around my DSLR. Picture quality is excellent. I love the 'ring function' feature and there's even a 'custom function' button.  I've had the camera a month and still find my left index finger in the way when the flash trys to pop up. This sometimes gets you an error message that requires a 'restart'. Wall Mart sells a small 'Case Logic' soft belt case for about $8 which fits perfect and has a little zipper pouch on the front for an extra battery which you will definitely need.""
"20101203","5.0","A gem of a pocket camera","Replaced my old Powershot SD790IS which had horrible low light performance and I must say, this camera is wonderful. Low light pics are amazing for a camera in this size class -- and yet it's super fast and handles wonderfully. A few minor quibbles with the control layout but they are minor. The build quality is amazing too -- the camera is small yet is so solid and sturdy. Is ready to take a picture super quick and it can do almost 2fps in burst mode -- continuously.Biggest gripes:- Mode dial too hard to turn. It won't get accidentally changed but this is ridiculous.- Cannot assign Movie Record to the shortcut button (Which you can do on other Canons.)- Battery life is a bit short and the battery indicator is inaccurate. Goes from full charge to no power left very quickly.That's it -- otherwise the camera is a gem. I highly recommend this if you want to step up to something with more flexibility than your typical point and shoot. You won't regret it.""
"20101201","4.0","So far, so good.","So far I like it and it is just what I was looking for; compact, reasonable feature set, easy to use.  Just not pleased with the popup flash, because I normally have my left forefinger there... but I am adjusting to it.""
"20101130","5.0","My 5th Canon, and the best yet","I started with an old Canon S100 (as I recall), went to the 110, and so on, to the 550, the 970, and now the S95. It's interesting I did not even look at other cameras, which I should have, as my brother just got the Nikon S8100 and it looks nice. I have no doubt that the Canon will take better pictures, but the Nikon has nice features. I really wanted a 28mm wide angle, and the S95 has so many features I have yet to read / discover them all. I like the adjustable flash, wink / smile detection, a Custom program mode. Honestly, every time I pick the camera up, I can't wait to use it.. the adjustable / programmable outer ring around the lens is nice. It may not be the best camera for the money, but for my money, and satisfaction, it's a great camera. I bought the SD4500 before this, and returned it, never looked back. The 4500 had some nice features, and if you have this camera, it's a good one for sure, but not want I wanted. Don't purchase accessories through Canon, you'll pay way too much. I bought an extra batter, the exact same one, a Canon, in Canon packaging, for 1/2 what Canon wanted on their web. I wrote them about this, their response, 'other companies can sell for less, buy from them'.. which I did. Good luck on your purchase, whatever you end up getting.NEW, 10/1/11 - I've had my S95 now for about a year, and still LOVE IT! So much so, I wanted to edit my original post - I use the S95 almost every day and find features I use, that I have not been using. For instance, I set up the short-cut key for a 4:3 format, I normally shoot in 16x9.. however on the digital picture frame I have, the 16x9 format leaves black bars on the top and bottom of the picture - it still looks good, but just bugs me. After trying the 4:3 format, this puts a 700x536 pixel image on the digital frame, which fills the frame completely. I now push the 'S' button, the camera changes to 4:3 format and I shoot a 2nd shot for the picture frame, then 'S' again, and back to 16x9. Did I say I like this camera? Good colors, everything everyone else says, good, is true. It's a great camera in my opinion.Scott""

This camera gets great great pics!!!  Even sometimes if i disable the flash, it still gets good shots!!!  It's not 100% perfect, but it's a big improvement over my previous camera which was a canon is780 (which i loved btw)...but this one is better, the detail is great!!  I've had the camera for about 2 weeks now, i keep it on auto all the time, or sometimes i switch it to movie mode.  I have not taken the time to learn anything about the camera yet.  Still even leaving it on auto, it's a great camera!!the only negative thing i have to say about it, is that i feel like i'm going to drop it alot, i try to hold it so i don't block the flash or the screen or touch any of the controls, so i have nothing to grip.  i've gotten used to it, but it would be cooler if they put a grip attachment on it or something so you feel confident that you're not going to drop it when you're holding it...""

It's slightly larger than the normal Powershot range, but it shoots RAW and has a very fast lens for a point and shooter.  Image quality is excellent, and the camera features a full range of settings, which can be at times, a bit confusing.

"20101123","5.0","The perfect compact camera (for now)","I really think the only way this camera could be improved in the future is for it to decrease in size. Otherwise, it is the perfect camera (for me, for now). The pictures are incredible. I have been on a search for a camera that would have the following features:1. Wide angle (28mm)2. HD Video (and this has stereo mic)3. Good low light performance4. Fun random crap (miniature effect, color accent/swap, fisheye, etc)5. Small enough that I'd be willing to have it in my pocket 24x76. Time lapse!!This camera met all those needs (and more). Another bonus for me is that I also own the D10 (Canon's waterproof), and the S95 and D10 happen to share the same battery! This means I have a back-up battery for either camera when I travel, AND, best of all, I only need to carry one charger!Totally random info, but today I accidentally discovered a neat little feature on the S95: If you press and hold the 'play' button (the button you press to view pictures) while the camera is turned off, it'll actually turn the camera on into view mode without opening/extending the lens. I'm sure this was stated in the CD manual (which is annoying, bc I'd much rather have a printed booklet), but I'm a guy and I don't like to read instruction manuals.Also, the fisheye effect will never get old for me. I can entertain myself for hours looking through photos of friends and family in fisheye mode. You actually get 3 different levels of fisheye effects to choose from (from not so fishy to very fishy). The miniature mode is cool, too.One of the more annoying things about the S95 (as some other reviewers have already mentioned), is how the time-lapse video mode can only be done with the miniature effect. I want just regular time-lapse, dammit. But, the fact that you have 3 different time-lapse speeds to choose from is pretty nifty.Overall, I have a feeling I will be owning this camera for a while.""
"20101123","4.0","Good Compact Camera","I think this is a very good compact camera; however, it doesn't provide DSLR quality.  It's great in low light conditions, but is not as good in bright light conditions.  I took my Nikon D5000, Canon 870is and the S95 out and took the same exact pictures with the cameras.The Nikon performed the best as expected.  The S95 was comparable to the Nikon in low light conditions.  My most surprising revelation was that the 870is is a pretty great camera too.  Performing beautifully in bright light and medium light conditions.Pros:-low light photos-image quality-manual controls - many more than the canon 870 and very easy to use-very intuitive interface-can set the ring in the front and back of the camera to perform custom tasksCons:-In bright light the sky appeared white instead of blue in several photos-flash placement - has pinched me when going down and gotten stuck coming up forcing me to restart the camera.-Video doesn't auto-focus during recording (much cheaper models do)-Takes a long time btwn shots - I'm used to a DSLR so that may just be my issueOverall, the S95 is a great camera.  I would recommend it if you need a small camera right now.  Otherwise, I'd wait until the S100 is released in the spring.  I like having the S95, but I feel it's over priced for what it is. (I paid $400).""

I almost went with the G12 but then found out that the S95 is virtually the same camera, just without the physical manual controls.I couldn't be happier with the choice I made.

What is also good on this camera is what you see in the screen is what turns out as picture... even the digital zoom seems to perform well under low light.The only issue I found so far is the flash popping up where you hold the camera (which is annoying some times), but I think it is a matter to learn how to hold it.Very happy so far.""
"20101118","3.0","Two Duds and Amazon Says No More - decent camera though","I owned the S90 and I loved it.  I loved the build quality and the only reason I sold it was to purchase the 550D.  I knew the S95 was in the near future and the S90 held its value and I received a 100% return which made purchasing the s95 even more appealing.I've had the 550D for 5+ months and I was starting to miss the small form factor of my beloved S90.  Obviously, I purchased the S95 when the price dropped.  Unfortunately the problems I've encountered (which oddly aren't showing up for others) are unacceptable.  My issue can be seen by searching 's95 defective lcd' on youtube.. it's the first video.  I received 1 replacement and the issue was worse than the original S95.  I emailed amazon, stating that the same problem was occurring with the replacement.  I made it clear that this 'was' the camera I've chosen to be my P&S, but they replied with an email stating that they were not going to send anymore replacements.  I've been directed to return it for a refund.  They did send the replacement with overnight delivery, so props for that.The camera itself seems pretty nice.  The few photos I took seemed on par with the S90.  Though, switching from different modes seemed sluggish compared to the S90. (or maybe I'm just use to the response time of the 550D)  The menu system also seemed slower than the S90 I had.I think I'm just unlucky.  The first S90 I purchased had problems with the pop-up flash.  The first 550D I purchased had problems with the front dial.Maybe I'll wait for the S100.. maybe Amazon knows something I don't.""

Operation of the menus and controls is very fast with little to no delay in selecting menu options.  The customizable front control ring allows you to quickly change frequently used settings.

"20101117","5.0","Great camera for a girl who can't stand the weight of a DSLR","This is the best camera I can find now for myself. I like its portability. In my opinion, for a camera that I can take everywhere I want, it can't be bigger than S95. I also enjoy its design as soon as I opened the box, very simple and plain. It could be better if they had a white version like lx5 though.We can't expect it can actually replace your DSLR, but it does have many functions like DSLR and it's much better in low light than most of the other point and shoot cameras. The only shortcoming is that it can't refocus when shooting video. I have to say this is a huge problem for me but at the same time I like its stereo sound recording function. Also, the battery life seems to be much less than 200 shots to me right now. I am not sure about it yet.""

So it is really depends on what you need.I would recommend this camera as a second camera to a DSLR for people who is or plan to be into DSLR field. For people who just want one high-end point & shoot with certain DSLR functions and it does not have to be pocket size, I would recommend them go for g12 or LX5 or any other comparable products with view finder, more controls, and better ergonomics. You buy it for pocket size (most important selling point) with great image quality. If you don't care about pocket size, you should go for its heavy brothers.Pros: compact, DSLR functions, 720p video, low light performance, ISO 80-3200, great image qualityCons: very pricey, no view finder, no grip(you are afraid to drop it every mins).""

Basically does everything that the G10 provides but in a smaller (and more convenient) size.  Low light images are decent.  HD video pretty good and I appreciate the R/L mics for stereo surround recording.  Manual controls are easy to use and the ring control around the lens is a clever design.

"20101113","5.0","Excellent purchase","There are several reviews from people who are disappointed that the S95 isn't the equal of a dslr. Anyone who expects it to be should not buy this camera. It is, however, is the closest thing to a dslr that will fit in your pocket.My plan was to buy a good compact first and use it to supplement a future dslr. Now that I've seen what the S95 can do, I may just scrap the dslr idea altogether, since the S95 is definitely good enough to be used as my 'main' camera. The S95 is simply the best truly compact camera available right now. It takes near-dslr quality photos and is small and unobtrusive enough to always be with you. Sure, a dslr outperforms any point and shoot, including the S95, in low light, due to the much larger sensor and bigger pixels. The S95, however, handles low light shots better than any other compact (the sensor is almost twice as big as the typical compact's). I still may eventually get a dslr for more speed and lens flexibility, but in all likelihood, I wouldn't use it nearly as often as the S95.I'm in the group that believes 'if it doesn't easily fit in your pocket, you'll need to carry it separately anyway, in which case you might as well get a dslr'. The LX-5 is too big to fit in a pocket, comfortably at least, and though it looks better on paper, the IQ isn't any better than the S95's, based on the samples I've seen. Canon's jpeg engine is better than Panasonic's, so unless you shoot everything in RAW, the S95 produces better pictures. M4/3 cameras don't make much sense to me (no offense to M4/3 users)...only slightly more convenient than a dslr (you'd still need to lug the body, lenses, etc. around in a bag), yet there's a significant compromise in IQ and the cost is similar to that of an entry level dslr setup.Two flaws (or intentional omissions) in the S95 are the lack of focus during video and lack of a superfine jpeg mode. Canon will probably include these features plus a couple more in next year's model, causing many to upgrade. Hey, how else could they afford all of that R&D?Due to its quality and convenience (which means this camera will get a LOT of use), I'd say the S95 is also a good value, despite the rather high price compared to other compacts. Anyone thinking of buying one, keep checking Amazon and wait for a deal. They often drop the price for a day or offer freebies. Got mine for $50 off and the deals will only get better as the holidays approach. Others have gotten theirs for under $300 when factoring in the special offers.Tips: save $$ buy buying a Maximal Power spare battery ($7; at that price I should have bought two) and Transcend Class 10 SDHC card (I got the 16gb for $25) These items would cost 3 to 4 times as much if you were to buy an OEM Canon battery and Sandisk card instead. Virtually no difference in utility, per the reviews. I use a microfiber eyeglass pouch when carrying the S95 in my pocket and the Case Logic TBC-302 ($7) for storage/travel. Fits perfectly.""
"20101113","4.0","a little realism","Let me begin by saying that I think many of the 'negative' reviews here are from people with unrealistic expectations.  I have had the s95 for a couple of months now (and I see it has come down in price) and think it is a great little camera.  Some people may think it is supposed to be a 'wonder camera' that will turn you into an amazing photographer that produces professional quality DSLR images and will still fit in your pocket!  Well, it's not that.It is a camera that is just a little too big to fit comfortably into the pocket of my jeans, but that is alright because I would rather keep it in a case that I can clip to my belt or that my wife can easily throw into her purse.  It does fit very easily into a loose shirt pocket of a side pocket of some cargo pants.It is a camera that is capable of producing uncompressed RAW images (not too many choices in this size that can do that), and/or compressed JPEGs.  For most people the JPEGs are fine, for some the RAW is a major draw to the s95.  Even in JPEG mode the images are great.  I am coming from a several year old point and shoot and this thing is better by far. Some people argue that this or that camera/phone takes images of equal quality when shooting JPEGs...  this might be true (phone cameras have come a long way) but can your phone shoot in RAW?  No?  okay then quit your whining.Does the s95 make me a GREAT photographer? NO.  I am still as good (or bad) as ever, but the s95 does give me several tools to use that go a long way to help me become a better photographer.Movies:  good quality.  Far better than I expected and stereo sound.Part of the reason I got this camera is to take pictures of my daughter as she grows.  Right now she is 9 months old.  If you set it on 'kids/pets' it is nice and fast but you give up creative control for the shot.  If you are using some of the great and plentiful manual features there is sufficient lag to be a little frustrating if you are trying to catch a fleeting smile.  Not anything that would make me want to return the camera, and certainly due to my abilities as a photographer... like choosing a faster ISO, or a wider aperture setting, or using the flash.Battery life is fine.  I actually thought it is quite good.  I guess I am not one of those people who has to check every shot and watch ever little movie over and over again while it is still in the camera.  I am more of a 'sort it all out later' kind of a guy.  I give a quick check to see if I got a decent shot or not, and my wife will look at the pictures we took at the end of the day (the s95s display is awesome for this), but that's it.  The battery lasted a couple of days for us with fairly heavy use.  We did buy a second battery, and I am glad that we did but only because it is really convenient and pretty cheap (if you buy an off brand).  Certainly the battery life shouldn't be an issue for anyone.I gave serious consideration to the Panasonic/Lumix for this purchase but thought that if I was going to spend that much I should be getting into the micro 4/3rds realm.  That will probably be my next camera purchase once the tech evolves a bit more, and prices are a little lower.Bottom line for the Cannon s95:Great (semi)small point and shoot camera!Not a miracle worker, not a revelation, just a solid performer with a lot of manual controls not found on most other point and shoots.Value:  Pretty goodI don't feel cheated having paid $399, now with the price at $366 you can get a spare battery, a SD card and a case and still get out the door for under $400!  Not bad.Cheers""
"20101112","3.0","a little pricey for the quality","I've been using this camera for several months and overall I'm only mildly impressed.

The camera is pretty easy to carry around and it looks cool, but I'm sure there are many others at lower prices with the same or superior picture taking abilities.""
"20101112","5.0","A Leap in P&S Camera Abilities","This is my first Amazon product review. I have just never felt the need to comment before but with this camera I just had to. A little background - I am an amateur photographer; meaning that I just do it for fun, not to make a living. I have a Canon DSLR and several lenses that I use all the time. But something was missing in my photographic arsenal. Sometimes it was inconvenient to carry the SLR and I was missing potentially great images that I would happen upon just during everyday life. A solution would be a pocket 'carry around' camera and a month ago I started looking around for one.After 4 weeks of research and reading copious reviews the Canon S95 emerged as the best because it had the most features that I desired and looked to be the best value for the money. Here is my summary:Pros:- Amazing image quality- Easy to learn controls (especially if you have other Canon cameras)- Solid construction (metal, not plastic - wow!)- Fits nicely into my shirt pocket (important for me)- An astonishing range of capabilities- Great low light performance- Wheel and ring work wonderfully to change settingsCons: (these are very minor)- Price! (I paid 399.99 I now see it is down to 388.83 but you are getting a lot for your money)- The pop up flash has caught me a few times even though I knew of this issue before I bought the camera (Old habits of holding cameras this size die hard)- OK, I admit I am old school - I like a printed operations manual that I can carry with me. Canon (probably to save money) provides the manual on a CD with this camera. The S95 does so many things I need the manual to reference when I need it during this learning curve. So only getting the manual on a CD is a negative to me (Are you listening Canon? If you can't provide it with the camera maybe you could sell the printed manual as an extra? I would buy one!).Overall I am extremely pleased with this camera.  It has fit the 'bill' perfectly for what I wanted and I would recommend it to anyone who has a DSLR but is looking for a 'carry around' camera or even to those who do not. It would be a great 'step up' for those moving toward the DSLR world.Buy it, you won't be disappointed.""
"20101111","5.0","Love to take pictures","We were on vacation in October and wanted a camera that would take great landscaping pictures. We got some wonderful shots. The ones that didn't show up good was not because of the camera, but the person taking the picture. We got an extra battery as some reveiws said that the battery ran low fast. We never had to use the extra battery and we took alot of picture. The only bad thing is when you need to ues the flash that when it comes up it almost always hits your finger. You do get used to it and learn to move your finger before it comes up. I would highly recommend this camera for the beginner and the experienced picture taker.""
"20101110","5.0","Powerful Point and Shoot","I needed a camera to take to Disneyland because I lost mine in Florida. I was strictly Canon, but now I must say that I love the Panasonic Lumix. It takes fantastic picture. I have a Canon 50D and its such a pain to carry with me on hikes, amusement parks etc... This one has a very nice lens. The colors are robust. I wish I can bring the F stop lower but 3.0 for a point and shoot is cool... For something compact that takes like SLR quality pictures the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 is for you!""
"20101109","5.0","Small package, big result","I just got this camera and haven't read all of the instructions and options for it yet, but what I have played around with has produced superior results to the Olympus camera of mine that proceeded it.  The picture's colors are vibrant, but accurate, and the low light shooting that I have done has not been grainy at all.  I am very pleased with this camera so far.""
"20101108","5.0","Excellent camera","To the point: great compact digital camera, has many of the functions of a dslr.  pictures come out great in customized 'P' mode, if you are an advanced user.  If handing it off briefly to a family member/friend to use, it's pretty much goof proof if you switch it to 'auto' mode.  The flash is the most powerful I have seen in a compact digital camera.  Most functions are very intuitive, especially if you have previously used canon cameras before.  Get it before the holidays to take memorable pics!""
"20101108","5.0","A.MAZ.ING.","If you don't own this camera, you should.  It is absolutely amazing. I cannot even begin to tell you what stunning photos this thing can take without a flash and in very low light. I just got the camera today and it is completely blowing my mind. I do need some more time to play with it and figure out all the settings that I can use, but so far.. definitely zero regrets on purchasing this. The only thing that bothers me is the pop up flash. I wish it was just inside the camera body like most flashes are. However, to be honest, it probably won't be too much of an issue as it looks like I won't even need to be using it nearly as much as I had to on my old camera. If I had more than 2 thumbs, I would give it more than 2 thumbs up.PS. you CAN zoom when shooting video""
"20101106","5.0","Almost As Good As An SLR......","No need to repeat the obvious improvements over the Canon S90 that have already been discussed.  This is a very nice small camera, certainly among the best available. Probably the best.  It is not an SLR, but comes very close, and is great to have with you when you can't carry the big stuff and lenses and all the assessories.I am very happy to have bought this, even though I already have an S90.""
"20101106","5.0","LOVE IT :)","I love the camera so far because it's the best quality digital camera I've bought in the last month.. (I've bought 5!) I don't know why but maybe its the economy.. my 2003 Sony T60 works better than any new camera that has come out :( It's so disappointing.. the new sony 90/900 doesn't even compare with the older model.. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE! And as for Canon, the SD940 doesn't compare to this... but my 2005 Canon camera is way better than the SD940 and this S95 I just bought!! THE S95 is too complicated for me :) I just want a point and shoot camera with the picture quality S95 is giving me.""
"20101105","5.0","Excellent Point & Shoot - Leave the SLR at home","I rate the S95 4.5 stars so I will round up and give it a 5.  I primarily shoot w/ a Nikon D700 and over $4,000 worth of supplementary equipment but I wanted something more inconspicuous for taking candid shots quickly when the situation arise.  This is my first point-and-shoot since I bought the first 10mp one, the Casio Exilim and I must say I love this camera.For most shotsFor those who want to compare a point-and-shoot to an SLR this can do almost everything a SLR can do except (totally control depth-of-field, i.e. isolate subject & blur background), get ultra wide, or ultra tele (obvious), or get crisp extremely low light shots (i.e. night cityscape)Pros:-Easily Fits in any pocket-Great Photos in day and low light-Fun extra modes such as miniature and color replace, etc.-Battery lasts longer than expected (a whole day of shooting photos)-note:  videos burn battery a lot quickerCons:-Wrist strap is 1000% completely worthless-Range could be better (would like 24 on the wide end most but more tele would be nice too.-Mode Dial could have some better grip (difficult to turn when hands greasy or wet)-Nitpicky:  Battery fits in slot all 4 ways instead of 1 obvious way.""
"20101104","5.0","After a few weeks, so far impressed.","I traded in my G11 for an S95 after I realized I wasn't taking the G11 anywhere because it was too big. A friend had an S90 and seemed to get great photos from it. Looking at the upgrades in the S95, and being a long standing Canon buyer, I went with the S95.So far I'm impressed. Although it's not a G-camera, it takes great photos and it pocketable so I take it to more places. Construction is excellent, and there are an array of functions that I'm still exploring. As a point and shoot it works well, and provides enough controls to get creative. Fast lens is outstanding, capturing many low light photos without a flash soliciting the 'did it take?' question. Yes it did, and the shot looks natural and crisp!Haven't done a big trip with it yet, but so far so good.""
"20101104","5.0","great point and shoot camera","I have an SLR that I love but don't like lugging around all the time.  This is the first point and shoot that takes pictures that are nearly as good as my SLR. It's small enough to fit into your pocket and still has a powerful zoom but when zoomed in the pics tend to be grainy.  You can easily adjust ISO, shutter speed, aperture, etc. without the need to go into the menu which is an annoyance I had with most point and shoots.  Definitely recommend if you like to take good pics but don't want to always carry your SLR with you.""
"20101104","5.0","Outstanding Camera","I bought this camera about a month ago and I like it a lot. It takes amazing pictures. Its Vivid Color selection creates bright colors, which gives one the ability to take breathtaking photos of nature. It is light, so it is easy to carry and it starts in about two seconds, giving one the ability to take pictures with ease. It is expensive, but it looks like it is the best camera of its class on the market now. I highly recommend it.""
"20101103","5.0","Canon S95, Great Camera for  everyday use and especially  Travel","The S95 is a great travel camera with great low light capability. It is loaded with many complex features that require a constant review of the manual. Alas there is no manual so be prepared to lug your laptop along to view the manual. No, the PDF supplied will display copy on all pages of portable devices including the IPAD 1, IPAD 2, Kindle, Nook and all smartphones. To view the manual you may want to use your desktop computer or your laptop or net books computer. Canon has gone 'Green' and is trying to save the planet by not printing the little tiny manual and instead, you must print the manual yourself which will have copy all over it too. If you request a manual from Canon, they will offer a printed 8 1/2by 11 paper copy in 4-6 weeks.Be forewarned, If you purchase this camera before traveling on vacation or a shoot, prepare to learn to use the camera before you travel. Fortunately, Canon has a consistent menu structure in the camera that is not that difficult to learn. If you are new to Canon, this camera is quite complex with the most features you could find on a subcompact camera. If you don't have much time learn the camera, consider a non-Canon camera that comes with a manual. Previous Canon users should be able to figure things out even without a convenient manual.The actual picture quality is as good as it gets with any subcompact camera. I keep discovering new things with the camera when I am traveling because I don't have the manual to refer to. You will have the same problems. I believe this is the reason for some negative reviews.The best qualities for this camera are great low light capability, which means you can get better pictures in low light without flash. it has very good image stabilization, feels great in your hands, nice controls, but a flash that pops up when needed, that can force your finger out of the way if it is coving it. The flash pop up is the most annoying thing with this camera and other cameras like the SX210-SX230 which also have popups. The flash works well and overall the camera could be the best there is in the subcompact field. It is the best there is at the $400 price point.Why 4 stars? The lack of a manual makes for difficult learning of a complex camera, a camera which is meant for travel. You will not learn to use the best settings and will make some errors that could render your pictures inferior to lesser cameras that have just automatic functions.If you never read or pick up a manual, the camera would be 5 stars for you. If the PDF was made readable, then my issues with no manual would be resolved.  Please feel free to comment if you think I am making too big a deal out of not having a readable manual. If you agree with me and you might not purchase a Canon camera because of the lack of a manual, please send your comments directly to Canon. Canon is a great camera and lens company but has made a very poor decision to exclude written operations manuals from it's products.Update:4/11/11I've taken several thousand pictures and am still learning how to get the best out of this fantastic camera. The camera is very complex and needs much time to use it to it's fullest. I've had success with 3200 ISO pictures that are impossible with my other non DSLR cameras. I am constantly amazed at the low light pictures at F2 and ISO's less the 1200. I've had some success at handheld from .1 to 1 second exposure. The image stabilization is impressive. I took 4 digital cameras plus a camcorder on a recent cruise and found myself turning to the S95 because its small size and high quality photos. I took a few video's but prefer a dedicated camcorder with separate mike for obvious reasons. I have several DSLR's with expensive lenses but they are just too bulky. I watched other cruisers with their big DSLR's but they just can't squeeze into your pocket like the S95. I took about 3000 photos and they will serve as a great memory for a wonderful trip. The DSLR users will have somewhat sharper photos of similar scenes but the shear volume of candids that are possible with this camera including food and menus and street scenes are truly priceless mementos.I am glad I purchased this camera and took the time to learn it before resorting to easier to use less capable subcompacts that I already own.Update 1/24/12After using the S95 for over a year I think this maybe my favorite camera to use. I could use my LX5, t2i, FZ150 and others but the S95 is always the first camera I take with me. What makes this such a standout is the overall picture quality, ease of use and pocket ability. It is not perfect but it comes close. I originally rated this 4 stars but raised it to 5 stars which is what it deserves.""

"20101102","1.0","Don't buy this camera!","We were tricked into buying this camera because of the reviews written in Amazon and BestBuy. The camera might be able to take pictures in low light but when there is too much light under the auto mode, the pictures do not come out correctly. I used a cheaper Canon camera owned by a friend and it took a better picture, in the same setting. For lack of better words and technical terms about photography, my wife and I just know that this camera does not take good photos when there is unbalanced light in the background under auto mode. We were looking for a camera that takes good pictures under auto mode because my wife is not very technical. This camera just brought frustration and cost us $60 in restocking fee at BestBuy. We ended up buying a Nikon Coolpix S8100 camera which is $100 cheaper and performs better. I am writing this review not hating Canon, I have used other Canon camera, I just want others to know that there are other options other than this camera. It does not perform well under the auto mode. You might have to play around with settings that applies to the photo that you need to take. But most of the time, a non-technical user does not want to do this. Bottom line, take a look at other models, this is really a bad camera, at least the one we bought.""
"20101102","5.0","Outstanding!","When I made photography my career over 40 years ago, I never thought I would ever see a camera that does everything the S95 does. The S95 technology would be considered science fiction back then. I have been a Canon customer for many years and use the EOS 1DS in the studio. The small size of the S95 allows me to take it with me wherever I go, but I still have the option to shoot in RAW format like the pro equipment. My most challenging adjustment was getting used to shooting without a viewfinder, but I am very pleased with the image quality and the features of the S95.""
"20101101","5.0","Great, pocketable P&S","I wrestled for weeks whether to buy this or the Panasonic LX5. In the end, the S95's size won out, and I've been extremely pleased with image quality. It so happened that my Nikon D90, for which I bought this as a pocketable complement, broke during a recent two-week family vacation. The S95 is so great, I only missed my D90 a few times. The only thing I've been unimpressed with is shutter lag, which is the the bane of all point-and-shoots, and I expected it, but I'd hoped they'd done more to remedy it since I last bought a P&S about four years ago. (It's been largely sitting on my shelf during those years because it was so slow as to be utterly useless). The S95 is quick but by no means fast. Where it excels, though, is image quality, low-light situations and its easy access to manual controls. Its ergonomics are really terrible, though. But I guess that's just the compromise you get when you want something that fits comfortably in a pocket. Oh, and that click wheel they put on the back of the S95? I can't imagine how anyone used the S90 at all if it didn't have the clicks -- I'm constantly turning the click wheel by mistake as it is.""

"20101031","4.0","Great compact camera -But don't expect DSLR Quality","I sold my last compact because I would get frustrated by the pictures it took. By getting rid of it, I forced myself to use my DSLR (Nikon D90) for everything and all my pictures were great. After almost a year, my wife asked me to get a small camera as she does not like to carry that big DSLR around.I wanted to get something that would come as close to a DSLR quality in a compact camera. I though the Canon S95 would produce images comparable or close enough.I received my camera after a long week. I went on a trip around my state yesterday. I took my new S95 along with my beloved D90. Big mistake. The honeymoon ended as soon as I uploaded the pictures on my computer.I know this may not be important to most. But if you are a DSLR user and want a compact to leave behind your big camera, I suggest you don't.  Carry the big camera whenever you can. This will get you a good picture, but is not close to what you get with a DSLR. There is just no comparison, DSLRs are so much better. But everyone knows this.For those who are used to DSLRs this will disappoint you. However, if you are upgrading from a lesser compact then this is much better than what you are used to. Let me break this down from most important to least. For the two kinds who are considering this expensive little camera.For those looking to get this compact to 'leave' their DSLR behind:Speed:This is fast for a compact but still not fast enough for sports, kids, or any kind of action.Dynamic range:A was used to blue skies. This would render the sky white where my DSLR would have it blue. In this regard this camera is like any other compact. I noticed same limited dynamic range with other pictures as well. I took side by side shots and this is the most evident difference, even during the day.ISO:Not close to APS-C (much less a full-frame) sensor. Images are usable up to ISO 800.Now for those looking to upgrade from a cheaper camera these are the advantages:Sharp Images:This camera produces images that are sharper than any other compact I have seen. Even when looking at 100%.ISO:ISO is much better than any other compact I have used. With most compacts, if you are taking pictures inside, you need to use flash. With this, you don't. TIP: when you do need flash, do yourself a favor and select the flash exposure compensation and bring it down a notch.Ergonomics:This camera is just a pleasure to use. Ring controls make it easy to change settings quickly. The flash is a big pain. It comes up where your fingers naturally rest. Be very careful with this..Conclusion: Should you buy it? As everything, it depends.If you are upgrading from a compact camera because you want a better compact camera, then this is much better. This is the best compact camera ever made.But if you are looking for much better pictures then you want a DSLR. For an extra 150, you can get a base model which is way ahead of this small camera in terms of image quality. Images you get from this camera are sharp but not much different than any other compact. IF you want a big upgrade then use a DSLR.If you don't take pictures often, a DSLR will be a better choice. I know people who, once they tried a DSLR, never use their compact cameras anymore. If you are used to DSLR quality, you should know that this is not even close. But this will get on your pocket and pictures are good, just don't leave your DSLR for anything important.""

"20101023","4.0","Canon S95","I originally purchased a Panasonic LX5 which is a wonderful camera, however, I wanted a camera I could easily slip in and out of a pocket and the LX5 was a little heavy and thick.  Keeping track of a loose lens cap on the LX5 worried me also.  I ended up replacing the LX5 with the Canon S95.  I have been very happy with this camera.  The menus are easy to use with a large variety of options, the screen is bright and sharp, the quality of photos is excellent, and the battery life is good.  Being able to assign the lens ring to different functions is very handy. The camera body is less slippery than the S90, however, I still opted for the Richard Franiec S95 grip which makes the camera much more secure in my hand.  The control ring has also been improved over the S90 but still moves fairly easily so I opted for the Lensmate control dial ring which inexpensively solves that problem.  There are three things I don't like about the camera.  Two are fairly insignificant but one does bother me.  The wrist strap that comes with the camera has no slider to tighten it around your wrist so it's just one big loop that will easily slide off your hand.  I am using a wrist strap from another camera.  The plastic door that covers the USB port does not have a solid feel when closing and it makes me feel like its going to flip back open.  I worry that it will not close properly after many openings and closings so I opted for a card reader instead. The one major point I do not like about the camera is the way the flash is operated.  In order to turn on the flash the camera must be supported in the left hand and the natural position of your left index finger is right on top of the flash that is trying to pop up.  It is also easy to push the flash button on the control ring with your thumb when you don't want to. First it will run into your left index finger then it will take several strokes to get the flash back to the off position.  My ideal situation would be a switch operated by the left hand that when pushed would raise the flash.  Or at least have the button that is not right under the thumb.  All in all this is the best point and shoot camera I have ever owned (this is my 6th) and would highly recommend it.10/27/10  -  One thing I forgot to mention when I first wrote this review is a program the LX5 has that I wish would be incorporated in the S95.  Before I sent the LX5 back for the S95 I played around with a program that does double and triple exposures.  A really fun option.  I'd like to see this on the next Canon S.""
"20101023","5.0","Worth Every Penny","I am new to digital photography and spent the last few months searching for a camera that would be as convenient and flexible as any P&S but give me the ability to play around with manual settings and hopefully take some breathtaking photos, this is it.The choice i had was the Panasonic LX-3, or the S90 (i took that long to decide the S95 came out in the meantime so hence my decision started again). I was initially attracted to the LX3, and after reading hundreds of reviews from people far more knowledgeable than myself decided that the Panasonic had the edge on features (JUST!).However the deal breaker for me was the size of the S95, although it has a photo quality comparable to many DSLR's, it easily fits in my jeans pocket (even inside the recommended 'CaseLogic' Soft case) and is as small if not smaller than many other P&S cameras. When comparing the size of the LX3 and this, it was clear that the LX3 is not as portable and is not 'jeans' pocket-able. I am using it for traveling so this was important to me.I will try and some up my favorite points about the camera after 1 week of playing around with it:PROS:- VERY Handy size- Extensive range of Pre settings that cater for any condition (the miniature mode is  fun to play around with, the effect of tilt shift built in)- Full Manual controls for when your are feeling more adventurous- Feels well made- User friendly controls and menus- Great image qualityCONS:- The placement of the pop up flash, as the camera is small you have to hold it at each corner. The pop up flash can take you by surprise as it is located in the upper left corner of the camera.SUMMARY:Fantastic camera and well worth the money in my opinion, if you are looking for a new high end P&S in the same price bracket, spend a little extra and get this one, you won't be dissapointed. I am looking forward to understang the manual settings and being able to use it to its full potential.""

And what?  --  no flat end to stand the camera up endwise for a timer shot portrait vice landscape?  What were you thinking?  Also, return time lapse video without partial defocusing for 'miniature.'  Keep both, but there was no need to kill regular time-lapse.  And next time, go 24mm wide.  Thanks.""
"20101021","5.0","Best "pocket" camera available right now","First off, no camera is perfect. This camera isnt perfect but its the best 'pocket camera' you can buy. Period. A lot of people compare this camera to the Panasonic Lumix LX5. The LX5 is an awesome camera but I dont consider that a 'pocket' camera. It is bigger and bulkier and doesnt fit in your pocket very well. I would almost compare that camera to the Canon G11 or G12. The Canon S95 is simply the best camera if you are looking for something very portable and you can take anywhere with you. I have owned the S90 and now the S95 and its the only camera I use. I take it everywhere to capture my 4 year old in all his activities. I used to lug around a DSLR camera but didnt like it because it was so big and bulky (but it took awesome photos) I looked into this camera (S90 initially) and fell in love with it and its all I use now. The S95 is basically the same but basically three things got better. Video which was good just got better because its now in HD. The sound which I thought was very good just got better because video is now in Stereo. (two very tiny speakers are now visable on the front of the camera) The S90 was very sleek and some said too sleek because when you held it, some compared it to holding a bar of soap in the bathroom. It was very slick. The body of the S95 has a texture to it now that is better and not as 'slick' to the touch. One thing I also like about this camera is it takes action photos a little better. The S90 'sports' mode took photos at a snails pace of about 1 photo every second basically. (DSLR's take about 4-5 per second and are very fast) The S95 does a little better at about 2 shots every second. This still is not very good but is acceptable for a camera like this and does help if you are taking photos of action, etc. Again, no camera is perfect but this is about as close as you can get until something new comes out next year. However, if you want an awesome 'pocket' camera that can take great photos (especially in low light), has a very fast lens (aperture 2.0), can be used fully manual if you want and takes very good video clips, this is the camera to buy. I am sure next year there will be some more improvements with this camera or features added and maybe Nikon or someone else will come out with something comparable to this Canon S95 but it doesnt exist right now. This little camera is the best right now. You wont be disappointed and quit looking around for something comparable because it doesnt exist. The only other camera that I looked at is the Panasonic Lumix LX5. It is a very, very good camera also (maybe a little better then this camera) but it is bigger and bulkier and really doesnt slip into your pocket very well. It also takes photos very well in low light (aperture of 2.0 also) and has a lens that is wider 24mm compared to Canon's 28mm and takes photos at around 3 shots per second compared to the S95 2 shots per second but its a little bigger and about $50 more. I encourage you to look at the Panasonic but the Canon wins for me!! Good luck and quit worrying and buy this camera!!!Update: Here is a really neat 'letter' that was written and posted on Yahoo the other day from an editor with the NY Times....I copied and pasted it into this review. Its good!Dear Canon S95,I don't often write love letters to gadgets. But you, you're something special.Truth is, I've been searching for someone like you for years.See, I love the huge light sensor that's inside an SLR. It can take sharp low-light shots without the flash. It can blur the background the way professionals do.I just don't like how an SLR is big and heavy and obtrusive.What I've always wanted is a little camera with a big sensor. Is that so hard?Apparently, yes. The problem is covering a rectangular sensor chip with a circle of light from the lens. Bigger sensor? You need a bigger camera. Those are the simple bylaws of physics.But you, oh, cute little Canon PowerShot S95! I love that you're a pocket camera, only 3.9 by 2.3 by 1.2 inches. I love your big, bright, three-inch screen, your built-in flash, your H.D.M.I. output for hi-def TV sets. I love that you turn on directly into Playback mode, without having to extend the lens.I love the unique control ring around the dial, which I can quickly program to adjust whatever feature I want: focus, zoom, exposure, light sensitivity (ISO), aperture, even degree of color saturation (all the way to black-and-white).I've had fun with your special modes, like the tilt-shift-lens simulator and fake fisheye.I love the wink-driven self-timer. Yes, I set up the camera, walk into the scene, and then wink-the picture is taken two seconds later. Beats hunting around for a remote control. (Or I can ask you to wait two seconds after a new person-that would be me, joining the group-enters the frame.)But above all, I love your enormous sensor. It's 0.59 inches diagonally-88 percent more area than most pocket cameras' sensors. And I love that you have an f/2.0 lens, a rarity among pocket cameras, meaning that you let in a lot more light.And all of this means that you, little S95, can take amazing, sharp pictures in low light without the flash. Your designers have shrewdly dropped the ludicrous quest for more megapixels-you have 10 megapixels, just right-in favor of something that really matters, like better photos.So many times I've used you for pictures at night, indoors, in shadow. Cathedrals, restaurants, parties. No, the results aren't as good as an SLR's-you still manage to blur a shot, especially in very dark situations when the subject is moving-but they're light-years better than any other pocket camera can do. I love to show off your photo samples.You're even better than my last love, your predecessor, the S90. Because you're slimmer. And now you take hi-def videos-with stereo sound. You have a high-dynamic-range mode, where you combine three tripod shots at different exposures into a single photo with a really great range of darks and lights. Your controls are refined in size and placement.Look, S95-I know you're not perfect. Your battery takes only 200 shots on a charge, which is very low. You won't let me use the optical zoom while I'm shooting video; in fact, you can't refocus while shooting video, either. (Your arch-rival, the Panasonic LX5, can zoom during video. Then again, it's porkier and requires fussing with a detached lens cap.)And, of course, you cost twice what most pocket cams cost. You're $400.But you are the best pocket camera on the market. I have carried you for many weeks, in many situations, and I have been thrilled by the sharpness, color, control and photographic success rate that you give me.Yes, Canon S95, I think you and I have a long, happy future ahead of us. Heck, you may remain state-of-the-art for several months at least!Love,David""
"20101020","5.0","Great all around camera.","I've had this camera for a little over a week now. I'm still learning the many features of it, but the picture quality is outstanding. I highly recommend this camera for anyone looking to get accustomed to the controls of a DSLR with the size of a compact. Nothing but positives so far from this camera.""
"20101020","5.0","PERFECT BALANCE","I have had 7 digital cameras in 8 years. I have changed all of my cameras, except for my poor photo quality Casio, due due damage or breakage. So, it may be only a matter of time before this Cannon S95 breaks, but in the meantime I find it amazing, and without a doubt everything i wanted and well worth the 400 dollars.Pros:-Amazing colors! The clarity, sharpness, and color balance are amazing.-Size: for the features and photo quality, the size is perfect. If possibly a bit larger than some compacts, the large size enables a better sensor (which means better photos).-Lens dial; the lens dial at first is a bit odd, but one gets used to it and it quickly is quite convenient.-Wide angle lens. The wide angle photos are not distorted, and quite useful for taking photos of large buildings, groups of people who are close, etc.-Solid build: hard to tell, but it seems heavy and solid.-No touch screen. I have never had a touch screen, but if you are wearing gloves, these are not convenient; and it seems like it would be too easy to touch the screen and change functions by error.-Great indoor photos. Canon was a bit behind Sony in the quality of indoor photos, but the candlelight mode on this camera is amazing! Images are clear and bright, without a tripod.Cons:-Flash pops out automatically, and in auto mode you cannot set the flash to 'on' - only auto. The flash pops out mechanically in the place where most people put there finger, resulting in possible damage.-Limited auto modes. Some cameras have two dozen 'scene' modes. this has half of the average. One mode, HDR, is nice.... but requires a tripod. But my iphone does not!-Limited zoom.I take on average 10000 photos per year, due to fairly intense traveling and tourism. I have only used the S95 for one trip, but the photos and the functions were amazing!I only wish I had bought the S90 a year ago, instead of having had a second-rate digital camera that broke after 11 months.""
"20101020","3.0","A lot more to be wanted","This is my 5th Canon (G2, S30, A530, XSi) and is supposedly Canon's best ever P&S.  I bought this for its compactness, low light performance, and image quality.  In these regards I would say it is excellent!  But for its price I would expect something that is top of the line on most aspect which I found out not true.What I don't like and wish the Canon Guy take note (most serious come first):1. Most people complained about the flash design which is true and very very annoying.  I have gone through 2 trips and 3000 photos. I still get surprised whenever the flash turns active and push my left index finger out.  The camera has safeguard measure so that whenever it detects that the flash movement is blocked it will stop and issue a warning signal.  The only way to reset it is to switch the camera OFF and then ON again.  I have gone through this procedure around 10 times a day during my trips. Because of this I expect the first thing to fail for my S95 would be the flash. And I would not expect it to last as long as my G2 (9 years and still going strong). CANON GUY, PLEASE MAKE THE CAMERA A LITTLE TALLER AND PUT THE FLASH FIXED IN YOUR NEXT VERSION !!!2. The internal micro-processor is too slow and the firmware design cannot handle real time event.  In layman terms, S95 responded too slow in every aspect.  One example is after I finished a shot and then quickly turn the front wheel to change exposure compensation and prepare taking another shot, I found out the camera did not respond to my front wheel adjustment at all.  It had to wait until it finished rounding up the previous job (and it took a while to finish!) before it has time to register any change on the wheels and buttons.  So if you acted too soon it will totally disregard it.  The killing part is the processing usually take long. So beware user: don't think you can shoot like a professional fast and quick between photos, you have to pace yourself and make sure u don't press buttons and adjust wheels too fast. CANON FIRMWARE GUYS: PLEASE SET UP AN EVENT QUEUE AND USE INTERRUPT TRIGGER TO RECORD ALL USER'S INPUT, SO THAT THEY CAN BE PROCESSED LATER, MY PANASONIC ELECTRONIC RICE COOKER DO A BETTER JOB THAN S95 IN THIS REGARD!!!3. This one is the deal breaker.  It cannot auto focus during video recording!  This make the video feature seriously handicapped. Althought S95 has small lens and a deep depth of field, you still find the video constantly out of focus when your kids are running around you while u r shooting them. I thought I would have spent $400 and get something that can at least do good photos and video.  Well, it can only do half of it and I guess I have to wait for something better in the near future.  Just for reference my $100 Samsung can autofocus during video recording!!!4. WB and some other adjustments not allowed to work in most SCN modes, which make the SCN shooting modes seriously handicapped.5. My favorite Stitch Assist Mode (for taking panoramic-view picture) works only in landscape, not portrait mode.6. The rear dial is much improved over the S90 (not as loose) but still easy to turn by mistake.  I have many occasions of changing the ISO from AUTO to 3200 by mistake.  When I find out it is already too late and I got a dozen grainy photos!7. Battery last only 100-150 photos in practical use and so need at least 2 batteries for a day's photo.  If you are doing video, expect to bring half a dozen !!!8. The image stabilization (IS) is not very effective.  I closely examined the LCD screen images when IS is both engaged and not engaged.  The difference is very subtle and nothing compared with Rebel XSi (SLR) in which the image motion is obviously smooth out and slowed down.  The salesperson told me don't expect any serious IS capability from P&S' I wonder if that's true.9. The lens is fast (F2.0) at wide end only.  But at zoom end it is very slow (F4.9).  My G2 has F2-F2.5 throughout the whole zoom range.  I can understand it's a limitation imposed by the size of the lens, not Canon's fault.  Coupled with an ineffective IS, I got a lot of blurry pictures at max zoom under cloudy sky outdoor.  I have very steady hands and I hold my breath when I press shutter, and my wife could do much worse. I wish Canon would put a better but little bigger lens in the next version. F2.0-3.5 would be a good compromize.In summary, you would think the S95 is wonderful when you play with it shortly at Best Buy.  The picture quality and LCD's display quality are superb too. But when you bought it home and put it to use in real life, you will find out a lot more to be wanted and that it's too far from being perfect at all.  Some shortcomings like the video focusing are in my opinion a design fault, others are inconvenience and annoyance.  The Canon Guys should have done much more than just a touch-up of S90.  I waited a long time and paid $400 for a camera like S95 and thought this would be the ultimate pocket P&S that will last me a long long time. Well definitely it is not simply for reason like the half-cooked video recording capability.  FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY, ALTHOUGH WITH ALL THOSE SHORTCOMINGS, IT IS STILL THE BEST POCKET P&S ON MARKET, NO OTHER BETTER CHOICE YET.In my opinion Canon still makes the best digital P&S and I might stay a Canon buyer in the future.  But my advise to Canon is to stop abusing loyalty of fans like me.  And make products that really live up to its name.  For those who already got a decent P&S, I would recommend hold your purchase until S99, S100 or whatever which at least solve the flash and video fault.=====================================================================Update 8/1/2011After 10 months and 5800 shoots, the lens stuck midway while power on. Manufacturer replaced the optical module. This is my first Canon that needed service within 1st year of purchase.  A little disappointed and worried.""
"20101019","5.0","Fisrt impressions - Alternative Review","OK here its my review for the canon s95,I've read all the reviews i could find of this camera until 09/29/2010 and many other similar cameras like, of course the LX3 and LX5 to the samsung TL500, so my bought was based merely based on reviews like this, I'm not going to compare it to other cameras nor write any obvious specs, just some quick pro-cons and impressions.Pros:-Absolutely pocketable-Smartest auto mode I've seen on a p'n's-Excellent quality of  lens, amazing macros and bright f2.0 aperture-Front and back ring are a delight to use in manual mode, that alone is worth half  the camera-Tracking AF is nice. Just center your subject, press half way, move your camera for the angle your looking for, and voil&agrave;Cons:-Half the time colours seem a bit  artificially processed, especially at high ISO, makes me wonder how much the digic 4 does, but personally i don't like canon colours-Battery dies fast, so you'll need a couple more this is not so bad because their are small and light and you don't need the camera to recharge them.-Needs a little more grip, i would sacrifice some size for it,  almost drop the thing a few times, now I wear a neck strap all the time!The camera will not perform miracles and make you look like you got 5000 dollars in your hands, but if what you're looking for is a kick ass point and shoot camera and want to do some night photography just click BUY-IT, you'll get a very well designed product that is made in japan.-Do not buy the s90- I was about to buy s90, luckily amazon recomended the s95. A week later after my s95 arrived I had a chance to compare the s90 in retail store, and for some bucks the s95 gives you HDR, the click stop back wheel, fun fish eye and miniature effect and the IS is a key difference for less blurry picturesOther stuff: I bought the maximal power battery for 8 bucks, it lasts little less than the included canon battery, try another brand. Also I bought the caselogic TBC-302 bag that amazon recommended and I'm very unhappy with it; I'm giving it away, it offers no impact protection on the front, the cloth inside seem rough for protecting a 400 dollar camera and even took an unfortunate spill at a dinner table and guess what... THE CAMERA GOT WET!!..""
"20101019","3.0","Nice Camera","I had the Canon S90 when it first came out and loved loved loved it so I was excited to see this newest updated version. I bought the Canon S95 recently on Amazon and I am not disappointed! The picture quality is the same, excellent, and the body is even better. I have not had any issues or problems with it. I don't particularly love where the flash pops up but honestly its a small inconvenience for the quality of photos you get out of this camera and I'll get used to it Im sure.  I'm still learning all of the functions, there are many, but all in all for portability and fantastic image quality this point and shoot rises to the challenge and may I say above the other Canons and Sonys Ive had.  FYI,  I recently ordered a screen protector for the LCD from Screen Patronus online and just put it on. Its a perfect fit for the S95. They only custom size to the model of camera you have and you get three. Totally worth the price for preserving your screen. Amazon customer service is stellar. Ive never had a problem that wasnt solved quickly.*UPDATE*Well, I have to backtrack a bit. First I am not a professional photographer but enjoy quality images and experimenting. I have an appreciation for photography and have a little knowledge in it. Also, I believe when it comes down to what is the best camera for you it takes experimenting a lot, and personal preference especially since both the LX5 and the S95 seem to be above and beyond others. I travel a good deal and want great photos. Having said that, after using the Canon S95 for a while I wasn't completely satisfied with the images overall. I used it in various lighting and conditions. They seemed to have a softness, albeit slight, that I couldn't get past. I shot with two different S95s and both produced the same results. My original S90 didnt have this issue. I don't know why. I used it the same way. This is simply what I experienced. While I had my S95 I had also been looking at reviews and specs for the Panasonic Lumix LX5. I took the plunge and returned the Canon recently and bought the Lumix. Ive never owned a Panasonic before. I'm even more impressed with the LX5. There was a noticeable difference in the image sharpness on Program mode, shadows seemed better and focus was crisp. For me, it feels more secure in my hand, the image quality is really exceptional( I think better than the S95 although I have not tried as many low light shots), and the color is rich but also can be natural. Also some the 'My Color Mode' options are super! The lens is faster as well. It is a bit bigger than the S95 but for me I don't really 'pocket' my camera most of the time anyways so it wasn't a deterrent. I usually have it in a belt pouch or in a bag. The Canon S95 is more pocketable and still produces images waaaaaay better than most out there, especially low light,  but I will be keeping the LX5 because so far, and I have not tried every function yet, it has won me over completely.""
"20101015","3.0","Extremely poor flash placement","I bought this camera knowing about the flash placement and thinking it would not be that big of a deal.Well, I should have followed my instincts on this.  The typical way that I, my wife and, I believe, most people hold a small camera like this is with the 'pinch' method of finger and thumb pinching the camera from both ends.  This method puts your finger directly over the pop up flash and each thumb under the camera on either side.  When the flash needs to come up it forces its way up and you have to move your finger.  I returned the camera to Amazon with no hassles.As a gadget and photo nut sometimes it takes the common sense of my wife to look at me and say 'Why would you want a camera that is not designed well?'.  Reluctantly I listened to her about this new toy I have purchased and realize that she is right.Image quality was nothing special compared to my Canon SD780is even though review sites like imaging-resource.com show significant improvement in noise and sharpness in the test images.  I recently bought the Sony HX5V and have been very pleased with the colors, detail and operation.  The colors on these small Canon's all seem to be too ruddy or orange to me when taking people shots with the flash.Just to qualify my review I own and use the following cameras:Nikon D700Nikon D90Canon SD770Canon SD780is""
"20101015","5.0","Don't expect a useful manual","The S95 is the best pocketable camera out there. I had an S90, loved it, and needed to replace it.I was surprised to get the S95  with only an abbreviated, quick start manual.  No full manual. A real manual is essential to fully benefit from this camera, as it has lots of neat and sophisticated features. You can download a PDF manual from Canon but it's very hard to read: the watermark label 'COPY' is printed on every page and obscures the text. A tech rep at Canon says all their cameras are being shipped without a real manual. That's disappointing. If I had known I would have considered the competing high-end point and shoots which haven't adopted the no-manual policy. Shame, Canon.""
"20101011","5.0","Excellent P&S with outstanding picture quality","I am not going to repeat why this camera is so amazing for the price. You can read that in the reviews here. But in short: highly pocketable, solid build, amazing picture quality for a  P&S camera, outstanding low light performance, tons of controls. And yeah, there are a few cons - actually - more like inconveniences but nothing that would be a deal-breaker for me. I bought this at a Best Buy. Make sure you get an accidental damage warranty - you never know when you will need it.""
"20101011","3.0","broken control ring","It took great pictures...but the control ring was not functioning.  Had to return it and hopefully the next one will work as advertised.  No problems with photos...and with great results...but 3 stars for broken ring.  I could not 'google' any other instances of a defective control ring, scoured the manual to see if i was missing something...but no...just a broken product.  Lemon? maybe...if anyone else has a similar problem, would be curious to hear about it.""
"20101010","3.0","It seemed too good to be true","I have been waiting for this camera for several months and the anticipation was more than I could handle waiting for it to come in the mail. The picture quality is amazing and everyone knows that, that is not why I am here to review this little guy. Video is one main selling points for me as I like to shoot when interesting things happen around me when I am never expecting it. The portability and the HD video seemed like this camera would be a match made in heaven for me. But, the video issues ended up being the deal breakers for me. I knew of the problems before purchasing the S95, but I did not realize how much of an issue it was. I have several older P&S models that can AF and optically zoom while shooting, why can't Canon figure this out? It's almost like that just want to save something for next year's model so people will have reason toupgrade.Also the macro is not on par with even budget P&Ss, I have to be at least 5cm away to focus in on very small objects. This seems like a minor gripe, but I love to shoot macro. I have taken hundreds of photos with this camera and I just cannot get as close as I would like.So I kept looking around for other options and I think the LX5 has all of the things that I have complaints with from the S95, so I purchased it and it should be here in a couple days right before I leave for the Bahamas. I will do extensive testing comparing both models for my needs. I really am in love with the portability of the S95 and I see myself taking it out more and getting greater photo ops than I would with my larger cameras. I know that the LX5 is $100 more expensive, but when already dropping $40, another $100 isn't going to make a huge difference over the few years I plan on owning it.I will update when I get back from vacation and make my decision on which camera has won me over.""
"20101008","5.0","All I can say is WOW","In the past 6 months I have bought (and returned) three different pocket cameras...all disapointing.  I didnt hold out a lot of hope for the Canon S95 and thought I might have to go up to a camera that wasnt so compact. I already have a Nikon D300 so I really didnt want to do that. Boy, was I surprised!the S95 is like having a mini DSLR in my pocket.  The pictures are beautiful, the controls very easy to use (didnt even really need a manual) and it fits in my pocket.  Good job canon, you got this one right.The ONLY drawback I have found is that while it does shoot in Raw mode the Raw file is not supported by Photoshop (yet),  also couldnt convert it to a DNG file :(  Adobe will eventually fit that though and I knew this before I bought the camera, so can't blame Canon for that one.Buy this camera, you wont be sorry!""
"20101008","4.0","Be Aware of Video Specifics","For its still image quality the new Canon S95 definitely deserves the 5 stars: pictures are very clear and sharp even at F/2.0 and the noise at the higher ISO's is controlled very well. However I purchased this compact camera mostly for its ability to shoot a wide angle video (28mm equivalent in 4:3 mode) in a relatively dark environment. If it's also your reason for buying this camera then be aware of some specifics of its video mode:1) Zoom does not work while shooting video. You should adjust the focal length before starting recording. If you're shooting a landscape or some people at the constant distance then it's not a problem.2) There is no autofocus while shooting video. You have to catch the proper focus by half-pressing the shutter button before you start recording. I usually take my video's at the most wide angle for which the physical focal length is just 6mm (which corresponds to 28mm of the film cameras) and therefore the depth of field is big enough to have things in focus most of the time, so it's again not a big problem.3) The real problem is the spontaneous flashing of the brightness of the entire screen when people you're taking picture of are moving in front of the camera. As every other video camera S95 constantly measures the brightness of the sceen and makes exposure adjustments. However while most of the other cameras I've been using now and before are doing that gradually (and I believe electronically), S95 uses its mechanical diaphragm by switching it withing a set of fixed appertures. When a person or some people are moving withing the frame the brightness of the sceen is changing gradually but the camera adjusts the exposure by doing sharp transitions from one fixed apperture to another which makes the entire screen flashing all of a sudden brighter and darker back and forth. If you're taking video in a very silent environment you can even hear on the footage some low-level clicks when the diaphragm is being adjusted.After doing some testing I've found that happens when a big subject (because it is big by itself or because it came much closer to the camera than the others) is moving into the central part of the sceen occupying more than 20-30% of the entire frame and the brightness of that subject is pretty much different than that of the entire sceen. For example, if in a relatively bright environment a person in a black clothes is coming pretty close to the camera and then either shifting out of the center of moving away from the camera.Unlike my other P&S cameras this Canon S95 provided much better video quality in the low-light conditions but the flashing effect became a real deal breaker for me.""
"20101007","5.0","S95 review","I purchased this camera with the expectations that low light performance and RAW image capability are what I'm expecting to be improved over all previous cameras.  And I'm not disappointed at all. This is by far the best camera purchase I've ever made.  It takes great pictures without the use of the flash and high ISO pictures that were unusable over 800ISO on other cameras look great on this one even zoomed in.  The RAW edits are great and with the software you can reduce your noise in the pictures even.  A very nice addition as I like to make them look as good as possible for printing.  And this camera exceeds all those expectations.  I am also a owner of the original Digital rebel and it takes great pictures still due to RAW capabilities but this camera is actually better on the picture side so far.  I've used the Macro feature once down to about 3 inches and had to use the manual focus capability and it is a nice feature and works great.  They've really put some amazing features into these little power shot designs.  Manual adjust-ability is great too.  And it's all about the low light usefulness.  That's the real feature along with RAW that brought me out to purchase again.  Otherwise I was staying on the sidelines till they improved them.  Congrats Canon.  It's a fine camera.Steve Matscherz (Pittsburgh, Pa)""
"20101006","5.0","A magnificent pocket camera","I got rid of my Powershot G10 because it wasn't pocketable. I wanted something that shot RAW (because I'm anal retentive about processing photos) and that was somewhat fast. The Powershot S90 came out, and I waited because it didn't come with 720p video capabilities.I'm glad I did. I love my S95. The f/2 lens is great - where my G10 failed in low-light, the S95 succeeds. I don't notice noise creeping into the photos until about ISO 800, but it's there. However, for a $400 p/s camera, it doesn't merit comparison to a proper SLR.Getting used to the ring control wasn't that bad - it was just new for me to have to use my left hand to take photos with a p/s camera. If you've used a Canon before, there's virtually zero learning curve. The surface has been changed from the S90, which didn't lend itself to making you feel like you have a solid grip on the camera. This feels solid and won't slip out of your hands.There are a few downsides worth mentioning. In-camera HDR isn't too bad, but for some reason (maybe this is just me) but it chooses high ISO photos to use for processing and thus, you've got noisy HDR photos. In well-lighted conditions, it's great and a nice little gimmick.Also, the downside of the camera shooting RAW is that you have to wait until RAW codecs are available for both OS X, Windows and third party processing applications. I'm a slave to Lightroom, and I'm waiting for that to be updated. If you're like me, you'll set it to shoot RAW+JPG until LR/ACR is updated, then just delete the JPGs.The choice for me was the S95 vs the G12, and I'm glad I made the right choice. Naturally, this isn't my SLR, but the size and features make it great for me to use when I can't bring a large camera along.""
"20101004","4.0","Canon PowerShot S95 Review","Great camera . . . . BUT I didn't realize that Adobe Photoshop CS5 cannot (yet) read an S95 Raw file. Hopefully, Adobe will release an upgraded version of Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) soon.""
"20101004","5.0","I'm Happy","Had the Canon S95 for a week. I'm happy so far.  It makes the right decisions regarding aperture, shutter, etc better than any compact camera I have ever had.  I like the feel and looks also. Its got fantastic low light performance and bumps the iso very quickly and frequently.The only quibble would be the lack of a printed owners manual.  This camera has so many features, an owner owes it to themselves and the camera to go thru the owners manual from front to back. I ended up printing 4 pages per page, front and back so 196 pages/8 was the number of pages I printed.  Not too bad.I recommend the camera to anyone who is serious but does not want to carry a DLSR around (me) and anyone who enjoys owning a very competent electronic component.""
"20101003","5.0","Excellent image quality","Good in low light and excellent image quality with considerable colour depth.  While not the cheapest, it is well made and easy to use.  It didn't come with a card for storage which was a nuisance as the camera was a present and didn't work out of the box (a small capacity card would surely not have added much to cost).  A reliable product with the image quality of a much bigger more expensive camera.""
"20101002","5.0","Buy it.  Its flawless!","I bought this camera on launch day after reading the glowing reviews of its predecessor, the S90, and seeing that all of the complaints about that camera were fixed in this new S95 model.  I received the camera 2 days before a 2 week trip overseas to Scotland and on pure faith I left the DSLR at home and just took this Canon.I was absolutely blown away by this camera.  Its fantastic.  Image quality is stunning.  The camera starts up fast, it nails the exposure metering shot after shot, colors are vibrant, sharpness is good, and the fast f2.0 lens means quick shutter speeds even in low light.  On top of that, image stabilization works well and the low-light performance is great. Just set your exposure metering to -1/3.  For whatever reason, Canon's default setting tends to overexpose by +1/3.Battery life is decent, and the included charger is travel friendly with folding prongs.  Get yourself a second battery if you are going to be shooting more than 200 images a day or taking lots of video.HDR mode is nice, but you will need a tripod or table or other steady location.  If you have that, HDR mode can deliver really spectacular images in high-contrast situations.  HD Video is solid too.  I was worried about the 24 FPS but videos look fine as long as you aren't panning around like an over caffeinated monkey. And if you ARE panning around like an over caffeinated monkey, 30 FPS won't help you much.The cameara also starts up quickly, being ready to take a picture less than 2 seconds after you power it on.But what I really fell in love with were the controls - the two control rings let me have all the control I would normally have with a DSLR without forcing me to dig through complex menu systems.  Awesome!I can't recommend this camera enough, and its the first time I have ever given a perfect 5 star rating to anything.""
"20101001","4.0","Great pocket camera","I got the S95 about 2 weeks ago and so far I really like it, it replaces my SD870is, I got this camera to use when my T2i is less convenient to carry with me, the quality fit and finish is very good, and has new features (special effects etc.) that I have to learn about, having said that, I find that because Canon does not include a owners manual it's a real inconvenience to download and print 200 pages of text, at $400 the book should have been in the box, my other complaint is that the wrist strap does not have a plastic slider to keep the camera from falling off your arm, so the stock strap had to be replaced, other than that I would recomend it.""

"20100930","4.0","Watch out for that motorized flash","Great camera except:It looks somewhat delicate. The flash is not a pop-up but actually a motorized pop-up. What that means is that a button controls when the flash comes out of the body and even when it goes in by a button or menu. So the flash is motorized and not a trigger/spring loaded mechanism. This is bad because I tend to hold the camera with a finger on the top left surface where the flash is supposed to pop-up. And when the flash does pop-up, it does it by actuating a motor which bzzz's the flash to come outside and many times my finger comes in the way which may eventually break the pop-up flash mechanism of this camera.Whats even worse is that the flash will not go in by pressing the flash into the body. It will go in when you turn the camera off or through some menu buttons. So dont give your camera to a stranger who will take your picture and try to push back the flash by force. I think that would be the end of the flash. This is a major flaw.If you are planning to buy this camera then you probably already know that this camera is the best picture quality point&shoot camera in the market.""

"20100929","4.0","Excellent pocketable P&S","I got my S95 from Amazon.com a few days ago and here are my first impressions. Others have reviewed on the IQ, features of its whole specs and comparison with other P&S cameras.- Great pocket P&S camera with its small size and secure to hold due to the solid feeling of weight.- Solid build quality (feels like it's a metal case) and acceptable ergonomics (not slippery at all).- Direct access to common controls is great. I assigned the front control ring to focal length control (28/35/50/85/105mm steps), the shortcut button to WB (for JPEGs of course), and use the rotating wheel and live histogram for exposure compensation, and use P/Tv/Av modes only.  I had a Canon A95 and the zoom lever broke. So I am hesitant to use the zoom lever too much.- Instant feedback on WB control when adjusted - this is a great feature for indoor incandescent lighting even compared to my Nikon D70s and D5000. The D70s of course does not have live view and the D5000 has live view but does not show WB adjustment results in real time. Of course one can shoot raw but having this feature now I can get reasonable JPEGs quickly.- Indoor pictures without flash (with a relatively fast lens) are pretty good.- It remembers the last zoom position and powers on to that focal length.- Low geometric distortion in JPEGs (after software correction). Great for me as I don't use raw files.- Also good price from Amazon.com at $349 (09/22/2010).Overall this is a camera to take with you to places for casual pictures and for travel (together with a mirrorless/m43 with a pancake lens). The S95 will cover a reasonable zoom range and some scenic pictures with its 28mm lens. For better indoor pictures and some DOF control away from home it's better to use a mirrorless/m43 with a pancake lens if you don't lug your DSLR.Why only 4 stars? The continuous shooting rate is a bit too slow and if you use video it does not have focus tracking or optical zoom for video. I'd like to give 4.5 stars if possible.SUMMARY: If this is your only camera there may be better choices based on your needs. But if it is part of your toolkit the S95 is excellent!There are some discussions about a bag for S95 and I got the Lowepro Ridge 30. Not the smallest possible bag but it is still small enough with an extra pocket for the charger. Also if you need to put it in your pocket often go get an LCD screen protector (the ZAGG InvisibleShield for Canon G10 fits nicely).UPDATE (11/26/2010): Now dpreview.com just published a review rating the S95 one of the two best enthusiast compacts (for those who did not see the reviews yet).""
"20100927","4.0","Great Camera","I pre-ordered the S95 and am very happy with it.  I'm not a professional photographer but someone who is becoming more interested in photography and wanted a camera that I can learn on.  I had an old Powershot A620 and the size of the S95 is great in comparison.  It fits into my pocket or shirt sleeve comfortably.  I've no complaints about the ergonomics (as it was a concern with the S90) and find the controls easy to use and adjust.I went to my buddy's wedding this past week and took something like 800 photos in a variety of settings / lighting.  The photos in good light are absolutely amazing.  The ones in low light are good, provided there isn't a lot of motion. (Although still way better than any of my friends' cameras could manage.)I did buy a generic extra battery and glad I did.  Firing the flash for some indoor shots really killed the battery.Also, the HDR mode is really impressive.All and all, I'm very happy with this camera.""
"20120208","5.0","Great little camera!","We bought this camera after rave reviews from both of our daughter-in-laws.  We had a Canon Powershot SD1400IS, but it wasn't fast enough to capture the grandkids without blurring.  We are very happy with the S95--nice wide angle lens, great color & speed.  We'll have to get used to holding it differently, as we too have blocked the pop up flash from working. Overall--love it!""

"20120202","5.0","Amazing point and shoot","As an amateur photographer, I can say safely that the photos I've taken with this camera consistently look great. I take them around to random events at my university and on vacations, and the pictures from this camera, given decent lighting, rival those of my DSLR. The best parts? Not only is it so simple to use that my parents can use it, but it also has the robustness of controls of a manual camera, and it fits in my front jeans pocket. There are a number of things that make this camera far better than most other point and shoots--especially any point and shoot that is this size or smaller.First, the image quality in well lit situations is fantastic.  The sensor in the camera is far larger than most point and shoots, which leads to very good image quality. In general, there is very little noise and pixelation in images even at relatively high ISOs, and colors are represented very well.  In terms of raw image quality, I don't think there's a camera of the S95's size that rivals it.Second, the camera can open up it's aperature very large. I find this to be extremely useful as I think that flash--especially those on point and shoots--makes pictures look bad a lot.  One of the most common ways to make a picture look bad is if it's blurry, but that's not an issue for this camera, because the aperature can just open wide. It also allows me to take pictures with this camera that have a very shallow depth of field--a functionality I used to reserve for my DSLR.Third, the manual controls are pretty great. I really like how the ring around the actual lens is a control, mimicking a classic aperature ring.  This allows for natural manual use of the camera, and so I use it all the time for that purpose. The camera shoots to RAW as well, which is great.Finally, a bunch of random things.  The build quality feels good--no unstable parts, mostly metal casing.  Battery life is quite long, though I do have an extra battery just in case. And the screen and software on the camera itself are pretty good--not much of a pain to browse through a ton of pictures on a long vacation, since you can do things like organize pictures by date and jump 10 or 100 pictures at a time. And it's very simple to use, so even my parents are proficient at using it.In short, I love this camera, and it's by far the best point and shoot I have ever found. The only downside I can say is that it doesn't zoom very far--but if you get a camera that zooms farther, you will invariably be making a considerable tradeoff with image quality, and when zoomed in you'll probably take blurry pictures anyway (the more you zoom in, the more your hand shaking can affect a picture), so I don't see it as much of a downside. If you want a quality camera, your search should, for the time being, end here.""
"20120202","5.0","A five-star compact P&S!","I've owned this unit for several months, but was waiting until I had taken a few hundred photos with it.  I purchased it as a replacement for the Powershot Elf 300HS which was good in many respects, but falls short of the quality and consistency of the S95.  This one will stay in my arsenal and on my belt loop holster when I need a great kick-around reliable camera.  The 10 MP photos are stunning.  For quick-fire everyday shots, I use the vivid setting available in the 'P' or program mode.  Everything else is automatic and I rarely do much editing to the shots.  If I want to tweak the results, the processed jpegs lend themselves readily to adjustment tweaks in photoshop or whatever program you use.  Raw is available if that's your bag.  The low light capabilities of the S95 are good for both photos and videos.  I can't complain about the 720 Hi Def.  It's plenty powerful for the slideshows and Blu Ray discs that I produce and creates efficiency by saving both time and space when burning discs-i.e., the files aren't so large as to be space hogs.  The slide shows produced from this little beauty are as good as it gets and I have burned some really impressive bluray discs.  Most of the S95 shots on 'Program' need no editing or adjustment whatsoever.  Just load 'em up, add motion and transitions, a little background music and burn away!  The results are wonderful, colorful, and professional looking.There is very little lag time photo to photo and I rarely find myself waiting for the camera to complete any processing.  Just fire it up and take off.  It's ready when you are.  For its size & weight, I think it's one of the best & highest quality pieces of consumer photo equipment Canon ever built.  And I put the quality of it's photos right up there with my highly acclaimed Canon Powershot G12 which is considerably larger & heavier.  Either of these camera's make a great backup for my Canon 60d SLR, but I'd prefer to carry the S95 over either of them.  The only time I use the larger units is when I need a more powerful flash in the hotshoe.  Oh, and the 3' digital screen display is a beauty.  I used it last week in bright sunlight, and didn't have significant problems framing my shots.I recommend the S95 without hesitation to anyone wanting high quality photos in a strong lightweight camera that's comfortable in your purse, pocket, or belt holster.NOTE TO CANON:  If I could add one thing to the S95 to make it a perfect unit, I would add a little video record button that was available full time like the Elf 300 HS rather than having to spin the mode dial to the movie mode.  It makes moving back and forth between photo and video kind of cumbersome and old-fashioned.""
"20120201","1.0","Complete disappointment Canon","I bought this camera on Nov 2010 with high hopes on it. Took it to a couple of trips, took a couple of photos but after 11 months the lens cover started to fail. I thought it was some dirt, so I cleaned it. It work for a little while but then again failed. Returned it to Canon for service and they said the camera is not repairable and NOT COVERED by the warranty!! (the said the found corrosion). What?!?!?!? I protected this camera like no other and they said it cannot be repaired because of corrosion??? what type of crappy materials are the using to build this camera??

No regrets.""
"20120129","5.0","Outstanding camera","I got tired of trying to take decent low light pictures with my old point and shoot so I decided to try the Canon S95 after reading good reviews about it's low light capability.  This camera takes outstanding low light pictures.  It's so good that I've used the flash maybe twice in the year that I've owned this camera.  It has manual aperture, shutter, and ISO settings, but to be honest it takes such good pictures with the automatic settings that I seldom mess with the manual settings.  I was able to take some nice night pictures of the moon at night using the manual settings, though, to get the exposure just right.A lot of other brands will boast 5 zillion megapixel resolution, but this camera takes way better pictures under any conditions.  You don't really need more than 10 megapixels unless you plan to print poster sized prints.  I've had more than a few people comment that I must have a really nice pro SLR to take such good pictures.  I liked it so much that I bought one for my father and he's been pleased with his camera as well.""

"20100927","5.0","PowerShot S95 - BEST POINTSHOT CAMERA","I just bought the Powershot S95 about a week ago. I have been playing with all the features and I have to say 'What a great camera'. I played with the SD4500 at the store so I can't give my best opinion on that. But I will say the the s95 has shown very promising results. The Biggest difference is the Manual use feature. Its like having a manual car and you are complete control. I have gone through Sony, Nikkon, and other Canan point shoot cameras. This camera gave the best Low light photos and that was my biggest priority. I choose not to ever use the flash now. So nice to just take natural shots with natural colors. Using the manual feature you can turn any night time photo into a day time photo. You just need to know how to use the shutter, aperture, and iso levels. This is the only point shot camera that alows you to control everything. The price is worth every penny because once you buy a camera your stuck with it for a while and you want to get the most out of every penny you pay. I am not a professional nor and advanced user and after reading the manual(very important) I was able to take amazing clear shots. You can also adjust the flash amount which saves me from all of my photos looking bright white. If you just want to take the camera straight out of the box and just starting shooting, then AUTO feature will do great. I think the powershot s95 is a great camera and is something you should consider.- Again: READ THE MANUAL!!!(atleast on the different modes and how to use them)""
"20100927","5.0","World's Best Compact Camera","I Purchased the s95 over the Panasonic LX5 and the s90 after a bit of deliberation. Decided on the s95 after hours of reading reviews and doing some serious soul searching :) A couple of days after it arrived I left for an 8 day trip to eastern Europe. I also took my Canon DSLR on the trip. After seeing the ease of use, image quality, and benefits of a compact, I took a total of 2 pics with the DSLR and over 800 with the s95. The camera is unbelievable. With a few minor in camera setting 'tweaks' I had better contrast, more vivid colors and more convenience than lugging around my cumbersome DSLR. the $400 was a bit much to swallow at first, but once I saw how well the camera works and the quality of construction I see the $400 as a bargain compared to $1500+ for a new DSLR. As far as the way I shoot travel pics I like to be ambiguous and a bit stealth, and my DSLR just doesn't let me shoot that way. I truly enjoyed my trip much more by being able to slip it into my pocket, snap a great perfectly exposed shot and then move on. No bulky straps, extra lenses, or giant tourist flag hanging around my neck. Awesome, awesome camera. Set up the various shooting modes the way you like them depending on where/what you're shooting and this little sweetie will blow your mind.""

"20100925","5.0","From an non professional everyday user...","I have no idea how to use the manual controls of a camera. All this F-stop this or aperature that, I have no idea what people are talking about. All I knew was that I wanted to take great pictures on automatic. And this camera delivered! Due to the excellent lens this thing really takes crisp photos. Probably the best I have ever taken. I have a Canon SLR camera, and just shooting on automatic mode, this thing takes much better pictures. Outside in the night, no problem. It took great shots. Indoor it took great shots. Basically, in any low light situations, this thing will shine....Thats why I bought this camera. I have a Canon subcompact. Outside pictures it is fine, however, whenever shooting indoors or at night, it took horrible pictures. And the SLR I have is too big to use everyday. This thing was a dream come true. I was a little hesitant about buying yet another camera, but all my fears have been aleviated. The picture quality difference will be noticeable right away. I compared pictures at a dinner I went on with a few other couples. My camera blew the pants off there cameras pictures. Buy this, you wont be sorry!""
"20100924","5.0","Best compact digital camera ever! (until the next great thing comes out...)","I've always wanted SLR quality in a compact digital camera, and this baby comes very close.  For daytime, good light photography, it's probably as good as many SLR's out there, and in low light, it's far and away better than any compact I've ever used.  The range of manual controls is impressive, yet the camera remains relatively easy to learn.  I especially like the programmable 'S' button on the back, which can be programmed to 20 different functions.  I personally keep mine on AE lock (exposure lock).  With many other cameras, you have to move it around the scene until you find the right exposure, then half-press the shutter (which also locks focus), then recompose while keeping the button half-pressed, and shoot.  Kind of a hassle, and of course the focus is locked on whatever you locked exposure on.  With the s95, I simply find the exposure level I want, then press the 'S' button, which locks the exposure.  Then I can freely move the camera and refocus on what I intend to photograph without having to hold down the shutter button, or lock in the focus.  And there are many other uses for the 'S' button if you choose!  The front control ring is also programmable, being able to select from many options, including a custom option to create your own specific use.  The camera is highly customizable, but without being overwhelming.  It's fantastic!As far as performance goes, I have never gotten such quality images before.  The daytime photographs are incredibly clean and sharp, and the in-camera adjustments and IQ are great.  The light metering is generally good, as is the white balance.  And if you aren't satisfied with the white balance, there is a custom white balance mode, which renders indoor evening shots under lights perfectly, once the custom white balance is applied.  Apertures run from a fast f2.0 to f8.0, which can be used creatively in creating decent DOF photographs.  You aren't going to get SLR DOF performance with the s95, but you can create very interesting images at f2.0.  Shutter speed runs from 1/1600 to 15 seconds, perfect from getting fast action sports to perfect night time exposures.  And speaking of night time exposures, this camera produces outstanding images in very low light.  Using manual mode, you can create essentially grain-free long exposures, using a low ISO and slow shutter speed.  I have NEVER seen such clean night images in any compact digital camera before (assuming you can find one with manual controls!).  Even indoors, the camera produces very nice images, even with ISO's up to 1600.  I've noticed graininess starting around ISO 400, but that's at 100% view and nitpicking the shot.  Most family photos and indoor people shots are not highly scrutinized, so even ISO 800 and 1600 shots are usable.  WAY better than any other small camera's ability indoors at night, that's for sure!There is also a completely customizable mode, interestingly enough called 'C'.  You can program this to be set up any way you like it...so if you do a lot of specific shooting (night time, indoor family photos, lets say), you could set it up to have the shutter speed, aperture, ISO, etc, the way you like it.  That way, you don't have to enter manual mode or semi-manual and fiddle with the settings each time.  You have one full-time dedicated mode for shooting the way you like!And for those who just like to point and shoot, the auto mode is acceptable.  I personally use 'P' mode most of the time, which is pretty much auto, with some control over settings.  But if you just want to turn on the camera and shoot, auto will still render high quality images, though sometimes I have noticed with auto mode the autofocus can give me trouble.  Using P-mode will still make it easy, but with some more reliable focusing.  Besides, hopefully you are buying this camera with SOME intention on learning how to manually create better shots...but again, even if you just want to use the auto mode, you will get photos much nicer than any other pocket camera, a reason to buy this in and of itself.There are so many more outstanding features to list...I could go on forever.  Autofocus tracking, 1.9 shot-per-second continuous mode (with AF servo!), low light mode (with ISO's up to 12,800(!!)), scene mode with countless scene choices (including HDR which does remarkably well), and of course HD video mode.  Let me mention one thing about the HD video however.  It's not that great, in my opinion.  I also have the Canon SD940IS, and it takes beautiful HD video.  This camera does not.  There is a lot of 'judder' when filming moving objects, or when panning the camera.  It's not smooth at all when moving.  The 940 is very smooth, even when walking and filming.  The s95 struggles to maintain a clear video, unless filming stationary objects.  Not good if you intend on making videos of your children running or playing!  I think it has something to do with the type of sensors in each camera.  I don't know anything about this technical stuff, but it appears this camera's sensor is more geared for still photographs and not HD video.  However, there are two mics on the front of the camera, for STEREO sound!If you are buying this solely for the HD video, you may want to look elsewhere (you can get HD video in products much cheaper than this now).  Still, the video is probably passable to most, and should not be a hinderance from buying this great little package!EDIT:  When I first wrote the review, I did not know why the HD video was subpar to the smaller, cheaper SD940IS.  The reason is that the s95 only shoots 24 frams per second of video (FPS), whereas the 940 shoots 30 FPS.  The s95's video is clealy choppy, but you can change the video settings to shoot 30 FPS (but will not be true HD).""

"20100919","5.0","Simply Superb","I've become quite the compact camera expert of late, buying for myself as a backup to a dSLR, but also for colleagues and employees.Simply, the new Canon s95 is the best quality compact I have used. It's out of stock in a lot of places, but shop around -- even the Big Boxes seem to have them right now (don't pay the overinflated prices some marketplace vendors are asking).Having recently used the Panasonic Lumix LX5 for a week in Paris, I wish I had the s95 instead. The Lumix was returned the day I returned. It quite simply is not a compact camera, and stayed in the backpack more than any other compact camera would have.The S95 by contrast, has identical IQ, fits into a pants pocket, is small, and easy to use. The settings are quickly changed either through the menu, the mode dial, or the front ring. The small tweeks between the S90 and the S95 actually make a world of difference -- and it's a fine fine high IQ compact camera.Compared to a standard pocket camera, though, you might might find the zoom range quite limiting. It's better than the Lumix, but only just. It certainly is not capable of superzoom -- the optical zoom works to 3.8x -- but with digital zoom you can get to 15x. Those photos are unusable. The digital zoom is fine in a pinch for a 'must have' shot, but they are all pixilated and blurry one you get into the digital zoom range. If you are looking for a superzoom, this camera is NOT IT.But with the 10 mp size of photos, you can easily crop down, and the IQ is so fine that it will still look clear and sharp at normal printing size up to 10 x 8 for super cropped shots.I've been very happy with the S95 and have used it all weekend for several hundred shots. I am consistently surprised at the excellent IQ in almost all shooting situations. (There does seem to be some flare when shooting into sunlit situations). I see no chromatic aberation, no vignetting, and simply clear shots. The IQ is fine across all scene modes. Some of the creative modes are fun. The bokeh in depth of field shots looks great.IF you are contemplating between the older s90 and the s95, there is no comparison -- you will NOT be happy with the s90 once you see what the s95 will do.Quite simply, this and the Lumix LX5 are the best compact cameras on the market as far as high-end IQ and features. Either camera will do a great job with low-light shots up to 3200 (note that noise is still quite visible with both cameras, heavy at any ISO above 800 but also noticable in anything over 400 ISO with either camera).Still, for the money, the features, and the sheer compactness, there is no other current camera that matches the S95. Highly recommended.Pros: Great low-light shots; up to 3200 ISO; great IQ across most shooting situations; very compact and small; easy to use dials and menus. Good ISO.Cons: Limited focal-range up to 3.8x only (up to focal distance 105). Anything shot in digital zoom is unusable. No grip on body. No dedicated video recording button.""

For one thing, the viewable image on the screen is slightly smaller than the S90 even those the glass screens are the same size.

"20100913","3.0","Good camera.  However, probably not a better value than the S90","I have a T2i, G11, S90, and now the S95.  I really love the size of the camera and the fact it is pocket-able.  It can take pics on the same level as the G11.  I do miss the hot shoe but not the size of the G11.  I do have more misfires than the G11, and certainly more than the T2i.  However, I am disappointed in the video.  I bought the S95 for the HD video.  The G11 takes great video (albeit Standard Definition).  The S90 takes okay video but noticeably inferior to the video I've taken with my G11 (even if they are supposed to have the same sensor, there's a definite difference).  In fact, I think I liked the video from my old SD1200 better than the S90's.  The S95 while 720p, is vastly inferior in quality to the T2i (@ 720p) and really doesn't look much better than the G11's Standard Def.  Yeah, it's 720p, but it looks much more grainy and seems to lack clarity, even in outdoor and well lit video.  I wasn't expecting video on par with the T2i (at 1080p or 720p) but I certainly expected more than I got.  The lack of auto-focus and optical zoom with video is an annoyance.  And while I consider video a secondary feature, I would still like it to be good.  The upgrades over the S90 aren't anything great. It's not a bad camera (it's quite good) but I don't think it's worth the premium over the S90 for the few extra features you get.And another gripe is Adobe Lightroom 3.2 does not yet support S95 RAW files.  Not a knock against the camera or Canon, I understand Adobe works in cycles to add cameras.  Though I do wonder why the 60D already is compatible while the S95 is out and is not.  It's still something it's target buyer should be aware of (I wasn't until I tried to import the RAW files).Edited on 9/22/10 - One feature that I really like about the S95 that I didn't think about until using an S90 again was the ability to set a Maximum Auto ISO.  I would definitely miss that as that is something I use a lot.""
"20100912","5.0","My New Favorite Toy","I did a lot of research before buying and almost waited too late but I finally managed to get may hands on the Canon S95.  I looked in many places since Amazon had none in stock but I found one at another site.  I had the S90 and loved it, so when Canon came out with this upgrade I just had to have it.  I have only had it since Friday but it is now my new favorite toy.  I love the quality of the low light pictures and this new mini movie mode is just too cool.  Hope they come back in stock soon so everyone that wants one can have it.""
"20100911","3.0","Mediocre","I got my hands on this camera. I was expecting a magical camera...but unfortunately my expectations were perhaps higher. Low light images are only slightly better than the typical compact. Lots of grains even starting at 200 ISO. Day light pictures are decent but not as good as the Panasonic models. Low Light is better than Panasonic but still poorer than a 3 year old DSLR.This camera is good in all ways except the pictures are ordinary/mediocre. If you think you will get magical pictures...forget it. Its okay. But not good enough for $400. Just get a used DSLR for under $300 and those $120 cameras for those portable needs.Don't expect money to beat the laws of physics...for Low Light pics and moving subjects you need a big area to capture light. At day light most compacts including this will do decently.Update:There seems to be a cult of Canon S90/S95. Next time I would stay away from Over Hyped products. I just bought a Nikon Dslr. I took 300 pics, in just auto and scene modes. No fiddling with the settings. The pics just came out magical. And the DSLR just cost me 100 more than the current price of this mediocre Canon. For my portable needs I would stick with the iphone. For folks who dont have a iphone just get a $60 refurbished point and shoot with low Mega Pixels.Too much Mega Pixels would ruin a pic from a P&S.""
"20100909","5.0","Excellent image quality, full controls and pocketable","If you're looking for a pocketable camera that has reasonably high quality images, lets you control aperture, speed and focus and shoot in RAW format, this is it.  I bought mine as an upgrade from a previous small but versatile camera, a Canon Powershot S70.The Powershot S95 was introduced in August 2010 as a slight upgrade to the S90, which was widely praised for its image quality and excellent interface but criticized for being hard to hold ('like a bar of soap in the shower') and for having a control dial that turned too easily.  The S95 fixes both problems and adds a couple of other features in a package that fits in the pocket of your jeans (if they're not super tight).  The case is metal, and although there are no finger grips on the body, it's not slippery at all.  It feels like it's covered with super-fine sandpaper (like 1000 or 1500 grit, for those you who know what that feels like).The second major complaint about the S-90 was that the function selection ring on the rear moved too easily. The ring on the S-95 has a slight click when you move it, and it doesn't move unless you want it to.There are a couple of other cameras of this type, including the Panasonic LX-3 and LX-5 and the Samsung TL500.  They all have let you control camera functions, and like the S95 they have 10 MP sensors that are almost twice as large as a typical pocket camera, so the pixels on the sensor are larger.  That lets them gather light more efficiently, which reduces digital 'noise' when you shoot in dim light.  Image quality is noticeably better than photos from typical pocket cameras.  You can make an 8 x 10 or perhaps 11x14 enlargement, although a digital SLR will be significantly better for larger prints.  They also have f/2.0 lenses at their widest angle, although the aperture closes down as you zoom in.The Canon has two advantages over the Panasonic LX-3 & LX-5.  First, you really can put it in your pocket or in a belt case no bigger than the one you use for a mobile phone.  Second, the interface is a brilliant re-thinking of how a very small camera with a full set of controls should work.  There's not much room for buttons on the small surface, but you don't have to get into a multi-level menu on the LCD, and yet changing settings is fast and intuitive.For example, there's a ring around the lens that you can grip easily to control zoom, or, shutter speed, or aperture, change ISO, or manually focus.  You select what you want it to do by pressing a button on the top, and when you look at the LCD screen you can see what it's programmed for.  There's a selection wheel on the back for other functions, and when you move it, a clear set of choices appears on the screen. The selections are context-appropriate, so they change depending on whether you've set the camera for aperture control, 'Program' control, etc.The two Panasonics have the same sensor as their Canon equivalents, but they offer a slightly wider lens (24mm vs. 28 for the S95).  The LX-3 has a much shorter telephoto - only 60 mm.  The LX-5, which was introduced a couple of weeks before the S95, has a 90mm telephoto, and you can buy an add-on optical viewfinder.  It also has a flash shoe in addition to the pop-up flash, although you can buy a dedicated add-on flash for the S-95 to supplement its pop-up flash  The LX-5 is about 25% more expensive than the Canon S95 (and 60% more with the optional viewfinder) and while it would fit in a coat pocket, you can't stuff it into a trouser pocket.If you want a truly pocketable camera that gives you good image quality and full control over your photography, the S95 is an excellent choice.""
"20100908","5.0","Simply Amazing","When I first saw the S90, I was quite intrigued by the amazing low light performance.  As a dSLR shooter, I've become quite used to shooting at ISO 800 and above with virtually no noise.  I hate the look of photos taken with tiny, on-camera flashes.  They are very unflattering so I try to shoot with natural light as much as possible.  I've had a few older, basic point and shoots and eventually moved up to the G9 but they all had the same issue: tons of noise on any photo shot above ISO 200.  With the larger sensor size faster f/2.0 lens and advanced in-camera noise reduction processing, this seems to do just fine at ISO 1250 and 1600.This camera definitely rocks.  The small size means that it's easy to keep in my pocket at all times.  My other camera is a Nikon D700 with a huge, heavy lens that I hate to take out just because of its size.  The S95 is giving my pro camera a run for its money.  The picture quality is great and the in-camera scenes give you so many options as well as full manual mode.  Shutter lag is virtually non-existent.  The LCD screen is bright and fairly accurate as far as colors.  My last Canon, the G9, had a purplish tint to the LCD and didn't display colors properly.  The S95's screen is polarized which makes it much easier to see in bright sunlight.  The downside to this is that if you wear polarized sunglasses, the screen goes black when turned horizontally.The ergonomics of this camera leave a little to be desired.  It's not easy to turn on or off with one hand and i'm always struggling with how to hold it while shooting.  I find that I press buttons accidentally.  I suppose that's to be expected on a camera that's this small.  I'm also less than impressed with the HD video.  The picture quality was great considering it's a p&s but it is a little jumpy since it only records 24 fps.  Battery life is a little short, 1/2 a day of shooting (about 150 photos, a few >1 minute videos and some playback).  If you plan to take this camera on vacation, do yourself a huge favor and get a spare battery.""
"20100906","5.0","Pocket-sized camera with manual controls","I got this camera to replace my Canon SD880. I had considered getting the S90 but decided to wait to see if they fixed some of its usability issues. With the S95, they have.I was looking for a camera that fits in my pocket, so that I can keep it with me all the time. I don't care about megapixels but I do want a good lens and sensor. As I learn more about photography, I wanted a camera that gave me a little more control than what most pocket cameras offer. In particular, I wanted good control over aperture, shutter speed, and exposure. The S95 gives me all of that, plus bracketing, RAW support, shallower depth of field, high ISO (simulated 12800), manual white balance (blue/amber, green/magenta), flash settings, sharpness, and a few other settings that will help me learn more about the technical aspects of photography that I wasn't able to try out with earlier pocket cameras I've owned.There are also some features that might be interesting to try out: HDR, tilt-shift effect, stereo sound in movies, HD movies, movie wind noise reduction, focus tracking, face smile/wink/blink detection, saved custom settings, shadow correction, and some special effects. However, these aren't the reason I bought the S95.Some cons: no viewfinder, thick (fits in my front pocket but not back or shirt pocket), small battery (estimated 200 shots), slow HD movies (720p, 24fps), no time lapse mode (although the tilt lens movies are time lapse), no front grip (although Richard Franiec's custom grip should be available soon).If you're looking for a camera that fits in your pocket and gives you control over aperture, shutter speed, and so on, this is a good camera for you. If you don't care about pocketability, there are larger cameras to consider (like the LX5 or G11, mentioned by others). If you're looking for good movies I would look at the SD4000 or EX-FS10 instead. The S95 barely fits into a pocket; look at it in person before deciding whether you'd want to carry it around in your pocket. If you're looking for simplicity or thinness, this is not the camera for you. If you're looking for good macro or good zoom, other cameras (like the SD880 I previously used) are better. I would not recommend this as an upgrade to the S90 unless the usability issues are driving you mad, and if the usability issues don't bother you, you can save a bit of money by getting the S90 instead of the S95. If you want some of the advanced features from a DSLR but need something that fits in your pocket, the S95 is a good choice.""
"20100905","5.0","Ideal every-where-you-go pocket camera for a pro photographer!","I purchased a G11 back in May to be my always with me camera when not carrying my huge dSLR (5DM2 with grip).  Quite frankly I loved the G11 but it was too big to just throw in my pocket, and I secretly wanted an S90 for the same purpose.  Then in August 2010 Canon announced the S95 which dealt with many of the gripes folks have with the S90 and so I immediately pre-ordered one and put the G11 up for sale.I could not be happier with my decision.  Image quality is outstanding with the camera, as S90 owners can attest to, but the physical quality and the ease of use is fantastic.  I love the weight of the camera, the matte finish and the dials are top notch.  I really look forward to having this camera at the ready at *all* times!Bonus tip:  For those of you who can't import the RAW files due to the inevitable lage between release and 3rd party support, simply shoot in RAW + JPEG for now, and then delete the JPEGs later on when RAW is fully supported by your application of choice.Happy shooting!""
"20100905","5.0","Sold my G10 to a friend.","I won't go on with the features of the S95 - you can read that elsewhere.My G10 was too big, and the image quality never really impressed me - too many pixels and noise. It sat in a drawer at home.This S95 is amazing! Image quality rivals my DSLR bodies. I use a 7D and 5D with L lenses. I can't carry those monsters with me all the time. The S95 will be with me always.The video is MUCH better than the G10 (and probably the G11) but Im sure the the G12 will beat it. Still, the small size is what matters most to me. The display on the back is gorgeous. There are some special effects that are a lot of fun - especially the 'miniature' vintage and HDR presets.The (HD!) video is great. I could see using this a point of view on a video shoot. Due to it's small size it could go anywhere. Attach it to a bike helmet or a guitar.Buy it. I recommend this camera to everyone. You can obsess with all the comparisons and features, or you can grab one and join the fun today.Another review gave it one star. I don't get that. (?)What would improve it? Wider angle of 24mm would be cool, and more presets too. Preset could be added with a firmware update.I am traveling to California next week and may leave the DSLRs at home. It's that good.""
"20100905","5.0","Great camera and upgrade to superb S90","I own both the S90 and S95 (G10 and G11 also, as well as F-1 and numerous Nikons including the D90).Hands down, I took more photos on a daily basis with the S90 since I took it EVERYWHERE.As they say, the absolute best camera is the one you have when you need to take a photograph.The picture quality of the S90 is superb and the S95 is at least as good.Often the biggest limiter to picture quality is the skill of the photographer.Time spent mastering a particular camera is well spent and paper specs often can mislead.Discussing subtle nuances over comparable cameras is often more academic than practical.The S95 gives the serious photographer tremendous flexibility from full auto to full manual and superb features that are packaged in a truly pocketable high performing camera that is arguably best in class.So what has improved:Body finish...more tactile and grippySelection wheel on back has click stops....hurray!On/off button is where it should be.720p movie mode added (24 fps vs 30 for lx5) with stereo recording.More scenes including High Dynamic Range (very cool)Numerous technical innovations that result in more stable, sharper pictures.Button feel on back is more positive.Ring on front has more friction and feels more positive.Body even smaller and more pocketable.Menu system updated but if you can drive a S90, G10 or G11 you will be off and running.Improved hand lanyard placement.Improved shutter release.Slightly rounded corners...looks feels better.What stayed the same:Battery door and card slot.Same cables and connectors.Lack of grip....no denying it would add weight but...Build quality...as good as it will get.What got worse:This part is highly subjective because different people see the same change differently (I see the size reduction as good, while others have said it's bad....so be wary and know if you agree with peoples reasons).Thumb rest no longer there...I missed it.So there you have my first impressions and if I had to choose between the S90 and S95, the S95 is the clear winner!""
"20100831","5.0","Wow! What an improvement!","I spent two or three months doing tons of research to replace my old Canon SD870. Finally a month ago I decided to buy the S90 despite the fact that it didn't have 720 HD video, it was a one-year old model, and many reviewers disliked the looseness of the control dial. My S90 arrived in the middle of August and over the course of many days I learned how to use all the functions and was very pleased with the results.And then on August 19 Canon announced the upcoming release of the Canon S95. I immediately returned my S90 and anxiously awaited the arrival of its successor. Earlier today it was delivered and I've been using it all day.I must say that I wanted to love the S90, but the smoothness of the body annoyed me. I figured I'd just have to get used to the slipperiness. But now that I have the S95 in my hands, I can't believe what a difference the matte finish makes regarding secure handling. There's no way you can appreciate the difference if you haven't handled both models yourself. Honestly, that feature alone is worth the slightly higher price.Control dial issues? No longer! Subtle click-stops have solved that problem.Finger missing the shutter button on the S90? Well, the geniuses at Canon took care of that, also. You won't mistake the shutter button on the S95 for any other button due to the distinct and secure feel.I'm in love with this camera. I won't go into details about picture quality because it's as good as its predecessor; there are examples all over the Internet. And of course the S95's 720 HD video is a big improvement over the standard video of the S90.Only one 'con' I can think of: The new, smooth, elegant display on the back is no longer recessed therefore you'll have to be careful if you place the camera face up on a flat surface. In that position it appears the screen will come in direct contact with the table's surface.""
"20100831","5.0","I feel like I'm cheating on my S90","Two weeks ago I was using my Canon S90 which I ordered before it came out.  I did not expect to be holding that camera's replacement 14 days later.  In fact, the previous weekend I was at dinner with a friend who has a Lumix LX-3 and I mentioned that that camera's successor was recently released.  Who knew the S95 would beat the LX-5 to owner's hands?After seeing the release on DPReview on the 19th, I investigated the camera further.  I though, wow it looks very similar to my S90.  I compared stats and saw that it was fractionally slimmer and the power and ring function buttons had swapped placement.  The most exciting thing I found on the S95...  I could actually use a neck strap with it!  I found holes on both sides, now I just have to find one that'll fit (Come on Canon, you couldn't put one in the box!).Well, my S95 arrived today and I was excited because I still had my S90 before I dropped it off at the post office to meet it's new owner.  I was happy to compare them side-by-side in person.In person, you'll notice the finish compared to the S90.  That camera feels like a bar of soap in the shower now compared to the S95.  The new finish feels much better. It reminds me of the Magnesium alloy they use on Valentine One radar detectors.  I don't know what they're using, but, good job Canon.  No more thumb rest, I was a little sad to see that go.  The control wheel has a much more damped movement now and not so free-spinning.The shutter button and zoom dial are redesigned, along with the mode dial getting a different texture.Also noticed that the screen doesn't have that purple anti-reflective coating look (when it's off) to it anymore.  It just looks nice and black.  Lastly, the color they used to paint on 'S95' on the front is a darker shade of grey than used before to paint 'S90.'  Same for the words around the lens.""
"20100831","4.0","Not everything we wanted but close.","Here are some preliminary impressions of this successor to the S90.  I'm sure we'll all have additional comments once we've had some more time playing with it.* The body is slightly slimmer.  However, the body finish is much grippier than the S90.  A much welcomed improvement.* The front ring feels similar to the S90.  Not much changed there.* As we all already know, the swapped Ring Function and On/off button placement is a long asked for change.* The thumb placement removal from the back makes the entire back look much more pleasing but I'm not sure it will please everyone as some people actually like the extra thumb rest.  Personally I like this new look and with the grippy surface, it doesn't detract from handling.* The shutter button is a bit redesigned and feels better when using without looking.* The buttons on the back feels tighter with more precise finish.* The rear dial, which received the most complaints from users of the S90, has received a welcome improvement as it will no longer move from just you breathing on it. It's tight.* The flash movement seems better than the S90.  Less hazardous.  More rounded edges help reduce the pinch.* There are now stereo mics in the front below the lens.* Too bad the camera will not focus nor will it optically zoom when filming like the Panasonic LX5.* The 720P is only 24fps which is another disappointment as panning as well as fast moving subjects will be jerky.* There are also a whole host of additional functions such as HDR, Hybrid IS for close up as well as distance IS, focus tracking, tilt lens, face timer/smile shot/smile shot, simulated fisheye etc.  Not sure if I'll use all of these.* Finally and the most important point, the images don't look all that better than the S90 so if you don't mind the handling problems or slight video enhancements you may want to save a few bucks and just get the S90.Perhaps the S100 will be a better time to upgrade from the S90 for those who already own one.""
"20100831","5.0","A great successor to the S90","What a great camera and a great experience from the first photo you snap.  I fell in love with the S90 a few months back, practically ditching my Canon 5D Mk II whenever I needed a quick shot.  I started opting to travel light with only my S90 instead of lugging around the SLR and think I'm almost getting better shots.I've had the S95 for only a day now (I doubt anyone has had it any longer!), but improvements to the placement and function of the buttons, as well as access to the cable ports, is all considered and beautifully executed.The model designation is also more matte and subtle which seems like a new trend for Canon.""

Just got it today and haven't really put it through all the test but so far I am loving the picture quality.  I think it's better than my G11 that I sold recently.  It was just too big to carry around and I much rather carry my SLR if it's the case.  This thing is so small I can put it in my pant pockets unlike the G11.  I now have a camera I can take anywhere and have good quality shots.  High iso is great especially with the hybrid IS.  Low light shots are sharp with the new IS.  With the G11 I would have not gotten the shots.  It would have been pretty blurry.  Love the matte finish as it keeps it from slipping from my hands.

"20120122","4.0","Excellent camera","Like others have said, this is an excellent pocketable camera. I love having manual controls and being able to shoot raw instead of jpg. Having a larger sensor than most P&S camera keeps the noise levels down and the bright lens allows for greater flexibility in low light situations.So, why 4 stars instead of 5? The video. I don't shoot much video and realize that for great quality video you really need a dedicated video camera. But sometimes you want to grab a short video clip with your point and shoot. The S95 shoots 720p and the quality is decent. BUT, it doesn't autofocus nor can you zoom optically while recording. That greatly limits its usefulness. Even my old Panasonic Lumix maintains focus and allows you to zoom while recording. This could be done easily by a firmware update but Canon chose to not do it, likely so that people would buy the replacement (the S100) which shoots 1080p and allows for zooming during recording. That is pretty greedy in my opinion. Based on reviews it seems that quality control is an issue with the S100 with the focal plane not being aligned correctly which results in images being soft/out of focus on one side. Also, the image quality isn't as good as the S90 or S95 as they are cramming more megapixels into the same sensor size which also results in more noise. Given this problem and that it is much more expensive than the S95, I'm happy sticking with the S95 though I do wish they would fix the video issue with a firmware update.The closest competitor is the Panasonic Lumix LX5 which I really debated getting as it has similar image quality but much better video capabilities. I opted for the S95 due to it being smaller and a bit cheaper. Overall I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it.""

"20120120","5.0","Love It!","Absolutely love this camera! I have an older canon dslr that has been my main camera for several years now, and as much as I love it and the pictures that it takes I needed something more portable. But I wasn't willing to sacrifice quality or control. This camera could not be more perfect in that regard. It takes amazing pictures and decent video, and I can still change any of the settings that I would ever really need to change. I will say that the preset settings on this camera do a pretty decent job on there own. I've been particularly impressed by the low light setting. However I love having the ability to tweak the setting if necessary.  This camera is also perfect in size, nice and small without being too small, and fast too. The shutter lag is virtually non-existant! And we all know how important that last one is. Nothing is worse than missing the picture because you are waiting on your camera, and that has not been as issue with this camera!  I love that this camera uses rechargeable batteries! The battery life is decent, and with the spare I bought as a backup I don't think a dead battery will ever cause me to miss a photo. My one complaint is the pop up flash. It pops up exactly where you naturally want to place your finger to hold the camera. I have gotten used to it and try to hold the camera with just my right hand. But, if anyone else is using my camera (say to take a picture with me in it) they always place their finger over the flash which sometimes prevents it from popping up.  I worry that this will eventually cause the flash to break. However that is a problem I was aware of when I got the camera, and it would not prevent me from buying this camera again.  The pros definitely outweigh the one con.""

She did a lot of research beforehand and this was all she expected plus more.  Instead of buying the Bundle package I individually ordered the items to go with it. I found that shopping Amazon it was about the same price as the Bundle and I received much more and higher quality items.  Highly recommend.""
"20120115","4.0","Image quality is good enough for a pocket camera","For a pocket camera, Canon PowerShot S95 has very good image quality, even in the darker situation. Since I got it at a very good deal (almost half price), I like it very much.The only disadvantage is the flashlight is not covenient to open. But it's no need for almost all the day time. So it's OK.""
"20120115","5.0","Best Compact Camera!!!","I have used many Canon cameras (870is, ELPH 300, sx230) and they all get destroy by this camera.  The s90 is the best and its a big step up from those other cameras that i have used. It feels great in the hand and looks very professional.  The black color is just perfect.  The 3'' lcd screen is very clear and vivid.  Very fast camera for turning on and taking pictures.  No more wait time.  The pictures taken are very clear and have natural but vivid color. The battery is long life. I highly recommend this camera.I have seen the s100 in person and I don't like the new dull black color that they use.  It makes the s100 looks old.""
"20120114","1.0","Camera doesn't work","The camera I received was defective. When I turn it on, the screen comes on but it takes a full minute for any of the buttons to work and be ready to take a picture. All of my online searches indicate this is a precursor to the dreaded 'Lens Error'. I then tried to order an Elph 300 HS and received it with the same result out of the box. Never ordering or buying a Canon again.""
"20120113","5.0","great pictures","This camera may not look, or feel very good but it takes excellent pictures, pictures worthy of a camera that costs at least twice as much. And now that this model has been discounted its an even better deal. Apparently it has a very large censor that is usually found on SLR's. Check out David Pogues video and written reviews on the New York Times site. He raves about it. One caution though, the flash pops out of the top left side of the camera. Be careful not to have your finger over it or you could damage whatever little motor makes the flash pop out. We're very happy with it.""
"20120112","3.0","What's the big deal!","After reading all the great reviews on this camera I bought one. Disappointed. Having many used digital cameras for ten years I was expecting something great. I try it out indoors. A purple chair becomes bright blue when the walls are white. The color becomes correct only when that is the only color you can see. Oh I have to adjust the white ballance. Now I've got a purple chair with amber walls. I currently use a Panasonic FZ35 no adjustment necessary. Outside an amber object on the edge of the picture becomes yellow and is only correct when it is centered. I've tried to monkey with the different controls but the colors are never right. As a side issue the cd will not load on my windows 7. Great even five year old used camera cds will load.""
"20120112","5.0","Great of course","Does the S95 need more reviews? Excellent small camera, fast lens albeit a little limited in optical zoom; smart logic and great image quality. It is not a $3k SLR, but neither does it weigh 5 lbs. Perfect for throwing in the pocket to have everywhere, yet good enough for documentary video and photography. We have used these for shooting HD video on trans-Pacific research project and the cameras held up well and provided quality results. The S95 will remain a little workhorse of our travel kits for a long time.""
"20120112","5.0","Great pictures","This camera takes better pictures than most of my other point-and-shoots. Images are comparable to the SLR snaps that I have taken. Only thing is that, the flash goes up where I keep my left hand on the camera. So I am learning to hold it differently :-)""
"20120111","5.0","from a non-pro...this camera is outstanding","IF you are not a professional photographer and don't have the time or inclination to really get into photography (because that is what it takes to capture the best photos), then like me you are just looking for the best bang for your buck as far as pointing and shooting for the best possible results.  if so, then this camera is your do not pass go camera.  i don't know a thing about aperture, shutter speed or any of that nonsense.  all i know is sometimes the picture turns out better with a flash or without a flash so i like to know how to change that function.  other than that, i keep it on auto mode and point and shoot.  with this camera i've taken photos where friends and family have asked me if i had them professionally done.  that's good enough feedback for me!i love this camera.  it takes crisp clear colorful bright outstanding photos.  it's small, i can take it anywhere.  it's awesome.""
"20120111","5.0","Best lil' camera out there","This camera packs more features and functions into a pocket size than any I have ever seen.  There is a bit of a learning curve involved in mastering all of the tools available, but once you spend some time figuring out what some of the settings can do for you, it's amazing.  I routinely take better photos than my friends much bigger and more expensive DSLRs because this camera handles less than ideal lighting so well (night shots, cloudy shots, under water shots!, dawn/sunset shots, etc).  Of course, this only started happening once I learned which setting to use.""
"20120111","5.0","little camera - great picture","I have a Rebel T2i that I love but needed something smaller for convenience sake now & then.  I'm very happy with the camera, mostly b/c of the small size and great picture value.""
"20120110","5.0","Canon S95 outperforms all previous point & shoot predecessors","I bought this camera because I needed a point and shoot camera with higher capabilities than others I have purchased before.  I needed a P & S camera with digital SLR capabilities.  I was really tired of coming back with almost great pictures of the event one second after the dream shot could have happened.  I was not disappointed.  This camera catches action photos and moving subjects quickly enough to get the shot!!! No more, hey could you folks who just scored the winning goal, would you mind getting together and faking a shot so I can actually capture it on my terribly slow point & shoot camera?  Hallelujah!!!!  Praise the lord.  Amen.""
"20120110","2.0","Soft Focus","I was expecting more from this camera then my old point and shoot Canon SD600.  In full auto mode, pictures are mediocre.  If you play with the settings you can significantly increase the quality, but still the main problem of soft focus remains.  Pictures were less sharp then my 6 year old Canon.  Considering the difference of time and price, I couldn't accept the lack of clarity and returned the camera.""
"20120109","4.0","Jump on this!","At it's current low price, it's nearly 1/2 the cost of the newer S100 and an amazing camera for bargain hunters.""
"20120109","5.0","swewet camera and great price","purchased for my daughter for a Christmas gift since a DSLR would be too much for her.  I am happy that the results are great. Wish I bought two for the price offered. A sweet purchase.""
"20120109","3.0","No Video","All in all, this camera lives up to the hype in the reviews: just don't expect it to shoot quality video. YOU CANNOT FOCUS WHILE SHOOTING MOVIES. So, if your subject moves, you have to move with it, or else all you get is a blurry mess in HD. No auto focus, no manual focus, nothing.The video is such an after thought in this camera, I wish that they had just left it out rather than taking up precious button / CPU space. GPS tagging or some other function would have been way more useful.""
"20120108","4.0","Raw is the key to this camera!","Your best camera is the one you have with you, but....  I can't say I'm blown away by the Canon S95 point/shoot, but the RAW aspect really makes a difference, especially in the noise. I got it for a steal at $239 one day Amazon deal (new S100 is out).PROS It gives you more control than most and RAW capture is essential. Portable.  Video much better than S90.CON It's not a DSLR... just doesn't come close.  Pop up flash can get in the way.  Color saturation a little too cool.  Video not as good as S100.In the end, at least you'll be able to fix it (I couldn't with my other .jpg PnS) and you got the shot.""
"20120106","5.0","Best in Class- buy it before they're gone!","GF lost her camera. I wanted to replace it with a micro 4/3rds, but she wanted to be able to put it in a small handbag when we went out, so I was resigned to a compact point-and-shoot (PAS).My Goal: Find the best camera that fits in a purse/pocket that will take good pics when you're out at night/in a place with sub-par lighting to stop your GF from uploading blurry pics to facebook or having her take crap pics at night with her iPhone that never come out well. (Spoiler: this is that camera).A lot of reviews suggested this is the best (truly compact) PAS. I decided to spend a bit more, as most PAS cameras I've had take crap photos and everyone has red eyes. The S95 is being replaced by the S100, but it was not available yet, and I needed to get it before xmas. I have no regrets, the S95 does everything I need, for less. The S100 upgrades you from 720p to 1080p video and you get 2 more MP. We shot videos on this and displayed it on a 50 inch 1080p flatscreen and they looked awesome. Good enough for me. Save the money and use it to get an extra battery or a bigger flash card.Verdict: It's hard to take a bad pic with this camera! It is the first I've had that is pretty much idiot-proof- set it to auto, hand it to a stranger and you get an amazing pic back. Really. Worth every cent. I no longer have any desire to get a micro 4/3rds- I am confident this camera can take great pics in a lot of situations and to get better than this, I'll just buy last year's DSLR offering.PROS:1. Pics look awesome. Seriously. We snapped pics at the Golden Gate bridge at DUSK alongside our friend with a Canon DSLR with a decent lens and the pics look shockingly comparable. I'm not disputing the power/control of a DSLR, but for the price and size of this thing you just cannot beat it. Indoor, outdoors, at a basketball arena. Everything we've tried so far looks good. I'm not a mindless drone, but I'm also not sitting for hours waiting to get the lighting just right. Seriously, just point the sucker and click.2. We always have it with us, because it's small! We've taken hundreds of photos and have yet to have a single red-eye. Even when the flash does come on. But on auto, the flash rarely comes on and pics still have tons of light.3. Battery life is not awesome, but we managed to take a hundred or so pics over an entire day on vacation. Good enough for me. Amazon sells a no-name battery that costs as much as a latte and has good reviews.4. It is small enough to put it in the back pocket of my jeans, but it's a pretty tight fit- would not fit in a woman's jean pocket. But it fits easily in a coat pocket or a clutch.5. Flash rarely pops up and you still get awesome pics.6. I like that is has 'pro' features that give great control over your shots, so this camera can 'grow' with you. It can shoot RAW, etc. But honestly, we haven't messed with it yet (only had it for a month) because you can just switch it to auto and it takes awesome pics without any composition or thought on your part.CONS:1. The pop-up flash. Annoying, took me a bit to get used to. Now I hold in such a way that when the flash DOES pop up, my finger is not in the way. But I'm afraid when we give it to a friend to take a pic of us, it's gonna pop up and scare them and they'll drop the camera. This flaw has been noted elsewhere, and has NOT been addressed in the S100.2. Comes with wrist lanyard, but you can't tighten the loop around your wrist for security. A three-cent piece of plastic would have made it a lot more secure if you wanna dangle it from your wrist while using your hands for something else.3. Doesn't have a lot of zoom. There is a panasonic lumix that has more zoom, but it doesn't fit in a clutch.""
"20120105","3.0","Difficult to Use","I received this camera as a gift. Although it is a nice camera, it was not what I was looking for. I wanted a true 'point and shoot' camera. And this camera is not really that. It is bulkier than many other point and shoots and is considerably heavier than my last camera (a Casio Exilim). Unless you are shooting in Auto mode, I find it hard to use. There are a lot of controls that are hidden within other areas. I spent more than 20 minutes trying to figure out where the black and white picture feature was. It takes good pictures, but if just shooting on 'auto' mode, I do not find the pictures so amazing that it is worth the price tag.I also want to add that I absolutely HATE the flash feature. Whoever made this camera, should not have had the flash pop out the way that it does. There are so many times where my figure is covering the flash, because that is the natural place for someone to put their finger when taking a picture. So this is a huge issue for me. Especially when giving someone else the camera to take a picture. I wish that they made the camera a little larger so the flash could be included in the design.Maybe I am biased because this is not the camera that I had wanted, but so far I am not impressed with the value for the money.""
"20120104","5.0","Great Little Camera","I'm a Canon guy, so while I tried to start the process of buying a small camera by evaluating all the similar models, it wasn't hard to narrow my choices to the Canon models.  In the end it came down to the S95 and S100, and for the difference in price, I couldn't justify the added cost of the S100.  My other camera is a Canon 5d MkII, so I'm familiar with the quality of Canon cameras, and the S95 is no exception.  This camera is well built.  It feels solid.  And, most of all, it takes great pictures and it's easy to use.  I wanted something that my wife would enjoy using, as well as a camera I could have available to me when taking the DSLR was too much for the occasion.  I think I hit the sweet spot with the S95.I turn the dial to (A)uto and hand it to the wife.  She is thrilled with the pictures she's able to take.  I can then take it and change the settings to make it shutter speed priority, aperture priority, or use it entirely in manual mode.  I can record pictures in jpeg, jpeg+raw.  I can use autofocus, or I can focus manually.  All with this small, thin, relatively inexpensive camera.  If you like picking up your camera and taking pictures, you'll like the S95.  If you like getting involved in the intricacies of photography, but want a small digital camera with tons of options, you'll like the S95.All-in-all, this is a great little camera.  I am very happy with the Canon S95.""
"20120104","5.0","Great Clarity","Long story short the pictures are very clear and the camera does VERY well in low light situations.  The flash positioning is a little annoying, but I've already become used it to it.Only had it for a short time, but its the best Canon P&S I've owned and the picture quality is great.  On certain pictures you couldn't tell if I took the picture with my S95 or my T2i.Looking forward to trying it out in many different situations.  I'll update more later.""
"20120104","2.0","Seems like i did not get a brand new camera","packaging that came for the camera was not sealed, looked as if the camera was opened before and was tested before. Is this what i get for buying it via amazon gold box deal of the day?product wise, there is plenty of reviews of the S95 and i shall not add on to it. Happy with camera capability, upset with he fact that it is probably not a brand new set.""
"20120103","2.0","Quick review from multiple camera owner","I want to say first that I usually don't have time to write reviews but I felt it was important to write one for Canon's S95. I own several cameras, including Digital SLRs as well as several point and shoots. Every time I go out to purchase a camera I'm frustrated because no single camera is quite the right fit. I love Canon products but cannot recommend the S95 because of it's price and limitations. As several other reviewers have noted, the video on this camera is poor, it doesn't stay in focus, it's hard to focus, it's just too much work for a point and shoot. For stills, the low light capabilities of this camera are quite good, yet some of the images are blurred, so it's not great. My biggest complaint with this camera is it's too slow, there's a lag between shots which is simply unacceptable. I take a lot of photos and half of my shots are missed. Sometimes you only get one chance to take a shot, and that's it, gone forever. Really sucks! On the other hand every now and then the camera takes a great photo, usually when the subject is motionless. Also, as others have mentioned, the flash is located in an awkward spot. The bottom line: this camera has too many issues.""
"20120103","5.0","been eying this camera for a while","I got the Panasonic DMC-LX2 a couple of months before it was discontinued.... then Canon came out with the S90.... I loved the LX2... but really was chagrined that I didn't wait just a bit longer... anyhow, flash forward 4 years, and the S95 has been replaced by the S100... now I swoop and got the S95 on discount -- it's a great pocket sized camera that can shoot in RAW!  It's pretty fast and can handle low light settings pretty well (especially if you underexpose then process in post...) -- I'm a big fan, have had the camera for a couple of weeks now and the images are great!  If you shoot raw basically you have to shoot in the 3:4 ratio, while I missed the 16:9 of my old point and shoot, it's size and ease has make it my carry around camera.  Definitely better (and faster to shoot) than my iPhone 4 camera as well...""
