"20111227","1.0","Does NOT work with Canon 18-55mm IS kit lens","This hood states that it works with the Canon 18-55MM lens. It in fact does NOT. The extend tulip parts show up in the lens at low focal ranges. I would say 18-30MM. This produces a black area that takes up to 30% of the image at 18MM. While the hood itself seems solid and built well, it does not work on this lens. The reason is due to the front element turning while focusing. In a lens such as the 50mm f/1.8, this is not an issue since the focus does not turn the lens.In review:[1] Does not work on Canon 18-55mm due to turning lens while focusing.[2] Build quality is just fine for this price.[3] Threads seem to be ok, and have not stripped.""

Just kind of finess it on to the front and it blocks out the lens flare. Simple. Cheap. Easy.I would NOT get this cover for a lens that has external zooming mechanisms (like most canon kit lenses) because this thing will pop off due to the movement of the lens.

"20111205","3.0","Excellent seller, somewhat flawed product on a full sensor camera","The seller (Fanta Sales) is excellent. I got the item very fast. It took a bit to figure out how to screw it in, but in the end all made sense. The only problem I have with it, is that on a full sensor camera this hood obstructs the corners of the image, even when installed aligned with the view frame (the large petals up and down, the small ones vertical). This obstruction happens for my lens (28-105mm) at all zoom settings, most prominently at 28mm. Also, note that if you have any filters attached to the lens, this hood should go between lens and said filters, otherwise the obstruction is even more pronounced. See sample attached customer images.The other selling point for this hood is that you can rotate it to get the exact desired cover angle, depending on where the light is coming from. Well, if one rotates it from the recommended install orientation, it obstructs even more of the frame. For instance, if the big petals are aligned with the corners of the frame (necessary when the light comes from that direction) the obstruction is pretty bad.I guess I'll think about filing off bits and pieces of this hood at strategic points, in order to see if I can use it without having it interfere with the image except in the desired flare protective way.On a smaller sensor camera (1.6 factor) this hood seems flawless paired with my 28-105mm lens.""

"20111022","5.0","Great Tulip Hood --- Works Perfectly!","Was a little worried about the fit and ease of use after reading some of the reviews but am very pleased. I figured out that the notched ring on the base of hood screws up and down to release and anchor the hood to the lense.  The key is to tighten the screw ring on the hood, carefully line up the hood and camera with the arrow up as directions state and with light even pressure screw on. This doesnt require but about 2 turns - then the trick is to unwind the ring down toward the lens to firmly anchor the hood to the lens!!! Voila! Anchored! My other concern were reports that the lens cover wouldnt work and mine did!!! So I attached the lens cap holder on the cap and it elastically attaches to the lens shaft!!!  The only thing I found disappointing was that there were no real directions especially for difficulties but I guess I could have called on the seller for assistance.

If you have the standard Canon 18-55mm lens in the EOS DSLR camera package then your front lens element (and the threads for the hood) rotate while focusing.  A tulip shaped hood blocks reflection close to the rectangular frame of your image by virtue of it's notched shape. (So it doesn't block the corners of the frame.)

"20110211","3.0","Useful Sometimes For Some Lenses","This hood screwed smoothly onto the 58mm UV filter that is attached to my Canon S5 camera with its 36mm equivalent wide angle lense.  The hood has a twist lock that enable you to align the four indents on the hood with the corners of the picture frame and then lock the hood into place.Mounted on a UV filter, the hood did not cause vignetting or darkening of corners at the S5's widest 36mm equivalent setting.  It might, with a wider 28mm eqivalent lense.The hood did seem to help block sun from striking my lense when the sun was at a side angle to the lense.  However, when the sun was at an angle in front of the lense and directly above the lens, the sunlight would reflect on the long projecting tulip of the nood, causing white 'ghosting' at the bottom of a photo.And, with the S5 and its built-in flash, the hood left a distinct shadow on the bottom of photos.Although this hood is useful when the sun is coming from the side, I am replacing it with a round, soft rubber lens hood.  The rubber hood's design makes it less likely to reflect sunlight back into my lense.""

I had difficulty putting the hood on initially, and then once I got it on, it wouldn't come off! I spent 25 minutes trying to carefully remove it without damaging my lens. It's a very cheap plastic, and doesn't feel durable at all. The positive is that it's so ridiculously cheap that I don't need to be frustrated that the product isn't that good. It's also pretty lightweight. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone unless money is an issue. For the price, it's a good product to help you get to know the ins and outs of using a lens hood.

"20120509","2.0","Kinda works, but mostly garbage","This hood is obviously marketed toward the beginner market (those that don't know better in other words like I was when I bought this.)  I (like I'm sure most who will buy this hood) was looking for a hood for my kit lens, and thought it would work while making my cheapy lens look 'cool' and I'll admit, it's good eye candy, but that's when all the good ends and it all goes horribly wrong from there.First off, most kit lenses rotate the front element when they focus (or you focus them) which will also cause this hood to rotate, making it possibly interfere with your photo (kind of the opposite to what a lens hood is supposed to do!) Tulip style hoods are designed (in the real photography world) for lenses that do not rotate at the end (which is why the 'real hoods' for most kit lenses are not tulip style)Second, I don't know what this hood is supposed to screw onto, but it's definitely not threaded for any 58mm filter thread lens I own- it's more cross threading than actually screwing it on, which means it pops off, can potentially damage your lens, so on and so forth.Third, because it screws onto the filter threads rather than being a bayonet mount like a proper hood, it makes it impossible to use with filters- so forget using your filters with this.All in all, this hood is an absolute waste of $5.00 (thank goodness it's only that much) unless you're only out to make your camera look 'cool' but you're supposed to be a photographer- not a model.  My advice is to just spend the extra few bucks and buy the proper hood for your lens- you'll be happier in the long run!""

There are very few angles this can be in that do not product this vignette effect and since the lens actually rotates when you zoom in and out, it's impossible to keep track of what the precise angle of the hood is.

"20120323","1.0","Really, really, bad...","I have bought a lot of budget accessories before, and I don't make this claim lightly, but this is a total piece of junk.Rather than lock onto the bayonet mounting points on the outside of the lens, it threads onto the internal filter threads... or tries to anyway. Cheap, soft plastic that took about 25 tries before I could get it to catch, and once I finally got it on, it was so tight, I'm sure it was damaging the hood's threads, and possibly the lens's as well. And even though it is a relatively shallow hood, it still gets in the image at 18mm - and because it rotates with the barrel (at least on the Canon 18-55) it changes with the focus, and is never in the right place, and the threads make you afraid to rotate it. I'd also be very concerned about damaging your lens if it is set to auto-focus, because you would have to fight the motor to get it to rotate.Some of this is an artifact of the lens, but just shows that this hood is not really compatible with one of the most common lenses that it's targeted at, and for non-wide lenses, it's really just a throw-away piece of junk. I was surprised to find it was a 'name' brand (Bower) but that quickly led to disappointment.The only reason I don't return it, other that it's just not worth it for a five dollar order, is that the vendor threw in, apparently for free, a cleaning kit and a lens cap holder cord.

"20120123","1.0","Lies Lies Lies","Lens hood didn't fit any of my lens and I have three different lens listed as one that it would fit. Wasn't even worth me sending back so I trashed it. Took this to a few friends of mines to see if maybe it would fit their's NOPE. We all have Canon and it didn't work for either one of us. Wish I could rate this less then one star.""
"20120122","2.0","Look at the pictures above!  The Shadows in the corners","First I need to say that I will NOT be returning this lens hood.  I saw the potential problem in pics attached to this product above.  The shadows at the edges are definitely there.  I can not zoom all the way in.  The reason I am not returning it, is because I don't have any other hood for this lens at the moment and quite frankly it's not worth the hassle for the 5 bucks I would get back.  I'll get another hood later but for now, this works.  I am justifying keeping it because it came with a couple of other products that I will use, and it's doing the job (kinda).  Just be warned, if you are using this on the Canon 18-55mm kit lens,  the shadows in the corners will be there.""
"20120121","4.0","Wrong Lens Hood for Canon 18-55mm ... See Review","It seems like a quality product and if I had a different lens, where the lens didn't rotate when focusing, a tulip shaped hood would make sense. My problem for not remembering this when I bought it. Canons lens design makes it difficult to use many normal divices most photographers want to use. This includes polarizers (hope I spelled that right) graduated ND Filters, etc. You should never blame the device for this problem, however.""
"20120113","1.0","Not for me","Should have read others reviews but me being new to photography seeing a cheap tulip hood YAY, more like DOH!! Doesn't thread right on my 18 - 55.... So.... Nah""
"20120112","1.0","Tulip flower lens","I got this to use on my Canon 75-300mm and the 18-55mm. Did not fit at all.  Luckily, it was inexpensive enough that I'm not even going to send it back (ripped the box).  Just sending out a warning to anyone thinking of getting this.  Some people seem to have luck with it, others, not so much. Caveat Emptor.""
"20120109","5.0","Tulip Flower Lens Hood","Completely impressed and satisfied with this lens hood. Previous hood used left much to be desired! The screw type mounting of this hood makes all the difference. I plan on equipping my other lens with same make hood.PDS""
"20120108","1.0","not good","I've purchased items regardless of the negative reviews and had great luck with them, but this is honestly a bad hood it screws on and pops right off; how does that even work?It doesn't""

"20120104","3.0","Not exactly what I wanted.","The lens hood screwed into the filter threads instead of the outside of the lens as all my other lens hoods do.  The seller was very good but the product was not what I expected.""
"20120103","1.0","GARBAGE","This thing is complete GARBAGE.  It is not a quality accessory.  Cheap plastic, crossthreaded on the first attemp at attaching to my lens.  DO NOT BUY IT.""
"20120102","5.0","Digital Tulip Flower Lens Hood for Canon","This product is perfect, it works well with the lenses listed that we have.  I purchased this for my daughter's camera, and she is very happy with the item.""
"20120101","3.0","Can someone explain?","I just bought this, because when I was in school, on picture day our photographer had a tulip lens hood. When I put it on my camera it didn't seem to make a difference. I've only taken one picture of a piano, but i'll probably use it for our family's new year's card.""
"20120101","5.0","Lens Hood","I originally bought this for the primary reasons you should buy a lens hood for, protection of my lens and reduction of flare.  It also adds a cool factor to the image of the photographer!!!!!!""
"20111231","5.0","Did not fit on my 18-55mm","I bought this for my 18-55mm lens (stock) and it did not fit at all. However, I tried it on my 55-250 lens and it fits on perfectly. They are both 58mm so I am very confused. However, I'm rating it 5 stars because it provided a very good use for my 55-250, even though it does not fit on my 18-55.""
"20111231","2.0","Not the best","This item is exactly what you expect for the price. Very cheap and bulky. NOt easy to use at all. Not the sellers fault. It is what it is and you get what you pay for.""
