"20120612","5.0","Outstanding Camera","Canon did it again.  I purchased this camera because I just couldn't believe how cheap it was for all the features.  What I like most about it:Compact sizeRed-eye removal (really cool!)Quality photosHD videoOther cool features**One thing I really love about this camera is that it has a slider on the top which separates normal auto-mode shooting with specific, manual-mode shooting. I LOVE this. What a great idea on Canon's part.  This way, you can leave a certain manual-mode setting in place (like high-speed burst), and only employ it when the slider is in the manual-mode position.  Otherwise, it uses the automatic setting.What's also nice is that the camera remembers your setting changes when you turn it.  If you turn off the flash, it's still off when you turn it back on.I couldn't be happier with the camera for the price.  Cool colors, too.""

It has a million different photo options ranging from snow mode to fireworks mode. The 1080p video looks beautiful apart from the slight de-sync from the top to the bottom of the frames, but I have come to the conclusion that this may be unavoidable in point-and-shoot cameras. The low light video capabilities of this camera surprised me, and the noise reduction on the photos is very good, making everything look nice, although sometimes a bit soft.The camera is very small and light, but packs a huge punch in performance.""

The first one I got a couple years of use out of, the second one only about a year. This one I had for 6 months, and now the lens won't shut.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find the Ixus model here in the US. I researched online and found out that its US equivalent is Powershot ELPH 100 series. I waited (around 6 months) for the price to drop to $102 and then I grabbed it. It's well worth the wait! The pictures are exactly like my old one used to make plus there's quite a number of new features. The body is also thinner, sleeker and lighter which is great! It also uses the same battery as my old one so now I have a backup battery. I have yet to try the HD video and I haven't bought an SDHC card. I tried my old regular SD card, though, and it works fine so far for photos.For $102 this camera is truly a steal! I remember I paid over $300 for the old Ixus back in 2008.""

"20120112","4.0","Indoor photos are much better when taken in the program mode with a 100 or 200 ISO setting","I have been attempting to replace an older Canon S50 with a more compact camera for a couple of years. For me the key criteria is the quality of indoor photos since most cameras (and smart-phones) take excellent outdoor photos. I have purchased and returned several cameras, that while more compact than my old S50, simply could not take indoor photos that were remotely comparable to the S50.My first indoor photos with the Canon 100HS produced similar results; OK pictures but not very crisp. When I started to experiment with the camera to see if I could improve the quality of the indoor photos I found that when the camera is set in the Auto mode all of the indoor photos are taken with an ISO setting of 400 or higher. If you take the camera out of Auto, set the camera to 'P', and set the ISO at either 100 or 200, the sharpness of the photos is consistently greatly superior to what you get in the Auto mode (which automatically adjusts the camera to a high ISO setting). While I have not used the camera enough to determine if you can just set it in the P mode with an ISO setting of 100 or 200 and leave it there for all photos, both indoors and out, I suspect that you can. If you cannot do this, then I will end up using the 'Auto' mode for outdoor use and the 'P' mode for indoor use.In any event, this camera takes much better photos indoors in the 'P' mode and it is very easy to set up to use it this way. If I had to accept the indoor picture quality that results from the Auto mode, I think I would return the camera.After experimenting with the camera, I cannot understand why Canon programmed the camera to shoot at such high ISO settings when so much crisper pictures are achieved with the lower ISO settings.""

Terrible picture color, the entire picture gets tinted by the predominant color in the scene. Best Buy recommended this one due to the fast shutter but it is not fast, it's slow, possibly due to the auto focus, not sure. I'd say about 30 percent of the pictures I've take with this camera are blurry which is disappointing. I had the SD780 IS prior to this and that camera was great, somewhat slow focus but the picture quality was amazing. Some of the best pictures I've taken. Unfortunately it was dropped on the driveway before a snowstorm and was sucked in by the snowblower and shot against the house like a missile.

I did a lot of research on this site and cnet, and had a few options in mind.

He basically said that for a compact point and shoot, this was pretty much the best.When I got it home I couldn't have been more pleased.  I'm actually glad we didn't spend more on a fancier higher end camera, because this thing performs great for our basic needs.  It does so well on 'auto' mode that I haven't even bothered to mess with manual settings.  Indoor pictures come out great without needing extra lighting.Apparently it does pretty darn well with video for the type of camera it is too, but I'm not familiar with that personally.On a side note, I really like the battery charger.

"20120103","4.0","Not bad but Canon has better","I purchased this camera along with a few others to evaluate as a replacement camera for work. Overall it was a pleasant camera to use. Pictures were good, the camera handled well and construction was good.  However, in the end I returned this camera and opted instead for the Canon Elph 300hs (black), which is the next model up from this one.  This decision was guided by several factors.  First, the 300hs has a wider angle lens (24mm vs. 28mm) and this is useful indoors as it captures more of the scene.  Secondly, the 300hs is made out of metal (the 100 is plastic) and it feels extremely rigid and well built. Also the black textured paint on the 300hs is fantastic as it offers a nice secure grip. Lastly, the button placement on the 300hs was, in my opinion, better thought out than on the 100hs. Other than the differences stated above the 300hs and 100hs are very alike and would perform very similarly. However, for the small price difference and benefits listed above the 300hs, in my opinion, is a better value. That is why I returned this camera.""

Hence, the one-star rating.An interface cable is supplied so an amateur photographer such as myself would reasonably assume that he could transfer his photos to his computer to be edited and stored. Nowhere in the LONG description (which is meant more for experienced users than for amateurs such as myself) does it say that you cannot transfer your photos to your computer without a memory card in place. Can I print photos from the camera? After all, this is a 'point and shoot' camera meant for John Q.Public. The memory card offered for sale next to the camera implies that you can have more storage if you buy the card in addition to the camera. It does NOT say that it is a necessity if you want to do anything with your photos besides look at them on the camera's screen. All that being said, it is reasonable to assume that the camera is ready to go when taken out of the box. Maybe Canon's PR people are not looking at these negative customer ratings.""

Canon has produced a great little pocket sized camera here and I'm sure if I got more creative with some of the features, my photos would be even better.Sadly, the camera was stolen from the room of a B&B I was staying at and I've missed it greatly.

"20111210","5.0","A good "carry" camera","I'm a Nikon user, but typically carry a Canon compact as the so far Nikon hasn't made a compact that can compare.The 100 HS has an HD movie mode, takes well saturated color photos , and has plenty of gimmick modes (color swap, miniature mode, fisheye, etc.).  Most of these are simple software conversions that could be done in Photoshop but are added so you can see the effect right away.The modes I like and use are the high speed (sports) burst, low light, and slow motion movies.  At first the high speed and low light modes sound amazing, 8.2 frames per second and an ISO of 3200.  However, it does this by lowering the resolution to 3 megapixels.  At one time that was considered high res and can still be used. The low light pictures, back to back with my Nikon D700, have poor dynamic range and pronounced shadows where the D700 shows shades, but a picture is better than none. The slow motion movies, in 120 or 240 frames per second, are genuine fun to use but not of very high quality.Other modes I haven't found much use for is the 'Smart Shutter' that focuses/zooms on people's faces, which never seems to work right, and the 'Best Image Selection' which again is 3 megapixels.In general the 100 HS is simple to use, just power on, zoom, and press the shutter button.  I sometimes have it fire when it hasn't focused, but that may be intentional; a picture is better than eternal focus lock.  I typically get about 200 shots per battery charge, and have an 8GB card I haven't filled up yet.  You don't have all the manual controls of an upscale camera as it is a compact, but it still beats any smartphone.  For pocket carry I put on an LCD protector screen and bought a cheap $7 case to carry it in.  Extra batteries are cheap and they make two underwater cases for it, one for snorkeling use and one for scuba.Overall if you just need a camera for taking snapshots this will work just fine.""

"20111210","5.0","Great Little Camera","This is a great camera. I had a Canon 6 MP and wanted to update to a 12 MP or higher and I wanted to stay with the Canon brand so I checked out what they had. This little camera just stood out for me. The first thing that attracted me was the color, but that aside, it does great in low light, just like it says and you can choose to shoot totally automatic or switch it over to manual and either choose one of the preset shooting modes or just adjust your own settings. It has a great 3' viewing area and the controls are very similar to my old Canon so it was pretty easy to move over to this one. I find myself grabbing more for this one now, than my old one. It takes great pictures and I like that I can use the larger storage memory cards. The handle is about the only thing that they could have done better on. My old camera has a nice, flexable, soft handle with a sliding part where you can make the handle opening larger or smaller. This new one has a stiffer, vinyl like handle with no adjustment for the opening. It just seems a bit cheeper to me, but the camera itself is amazing. If you want a camera that will do it all for you, this is great for that. I am very satisfied with it's quality and the quality of the pictures it takes. Canon is a good brand.One note: it does not come with a memory card so I had to buy that separately. It does come with the battery and the battery charger, as well as the software though.As usual, Amazon did a great job with the whole transaction. Camera arrived safe and sound within a reasonable time.""
"20111209","4.0","would have been a 5 star product if a manuel had been included","Wonderful camera.  But for some odd reason, Amazon chose not to send the owners manuel with the camera.  Strange, as I had to look it up on line and download 212pages of manuel.  Would have LOVED to have the manuel to take with us as we aren't always going to be able to access the computer when shooting pictures with the camera.  Printing 212 pages is a bit expensive and bulky as well.  Why Amazon did not include the manuel for a product of this value and complexity is very strange.  But the product is a great product indeed.  Again, we would have given the product five stars if we had a manuel.Another strange thing is that there was no option for seller's feedback for this item.  Strange again.""

"20111206","4.0","ONLY ONE DRAWBACK - SHORT BATTERY LIFE","I am a Canon girl and I like this little camera; it takes good, sharp pictures.  But, beware -- the battery life is very short.  I shoot in a setting that makes the largest pictures and I can only get about 400 - 450 pictures.  That's without any video use at all!  I have been several places and have had the battery go dead.  Either buy a spare or find a camera with a longer battery life.  (Maybe if I set the picture size lower, the battery would last longer - but I like the full size pictures, so I haven't tried that.)Other than that, this is usual great Canon quality. It's very small, has a big, very nice, screen in the back.There is no viewfinder, only the screen.  My previous little Canon had a viewfinder; but, most little pocket cameras don't have that.  That takes getting used to if you use an SLR with a view finder.I would have rated this 5 if the battery lasted longer.""

"20111204","2.0","disappointed","We bought this camera because of the image stabilization. It does not do what we expected. Many of the pictures are blurred. The color is also too vivid, almost looking 'cartoonish'. However, it takes good pics much of the time. If we can think through before we take the pic as to set the appropriate flash or setting (it has only a few settings) then we can avoid the blur and the weird color problem. But when taking pics of kids or pets its a bit hard to switch modes and flash settings quickly enough. I would not recommend this camera for anyone with children. Disappointed.""
"20111203","5.0","Camera is really worth every cent","I have been reading all those 1-star reviews where people kept saying something like 'ohmygod, camera's bad, camera broke, pictures are bad, lens are awful, do not buy this' etc.What can I recommend those people is to throw out their hands, not camera. Why?My co-worker bought this camera two weeks ago at BestBuy without reading any reviews or characteristics. What we needed was an everyday simple smart camera for taking photos of delivered cars.I use it in all weather conditions, and every day; I take ~10 photos every 15-20 minutes. In short, I use it A LOT. And my question is following: WHY for a period of two weeks of it's 6d/week, 12h/day usage this camera had been (and still is) taking great and rich photos, in all weather conditions, in dark and light, not blurring (or spoiling in any other way) pictures? Maybe the issue is in hands, not in camera?Yes, ELPH 100 HS might sometimes make wrong focus or choose wrong mode. But come on, people, what a hell do you expect from a camera for a bit more than $100? That you will simply use it in AUTO mode, and your muscles will pump, and your eyes will turn baby blues, and your pics will become as cool, as Chuck Norris? Don't be ridiculous.Bottom line: if your are not a professional who makes photos for living, but a regular man who has no need to use any other mode than 'auto', and you need a good camera for taking shots of your parties, friends etc - Canon ELPH 100 HS is right for you.  Simply buy it, you will not regret.""
"20111203","5.0","Excellent Point & Shoot Camera","This is a great point and shoot camera, and it is purely a point and shoot camera.  Photos are consistently good, saturated, and accurate.  It fits easily in any pocket.  While this is a camera, I also found the movie mode great if your trying to catch movies here and there, like a birthday party, etc.  If zoom is important to you in movie mode, please note that it does have zoom, but it's digital zoom--not optical.  Redeye is generally not a problem and there's redeye removal in the camera (in addition to your software): remember this is a point and shoot camera, so that's a good thing.  Lastly, one of the features I think is handy is the i-Contrast feature which is designed to increase overall contrast.  At times, there's a slight increase in noise with i-Contrast, but you can turn it off (and you can apply it in playback mode at different leves, auto, low, medium, and high).  For the price, I think most people will like this camera, and especially love it if you are looking for a camera that you can take any where to catch those moments.""

"20111125","2.0","Not a Canon standard camera","I thought of buying a CMOS sensor based camera for low light indoor photography, but i am not satisfied by the picture quality, the basic details are missing in the images. The image size varies between 1.5MB to 3MB, which itself states that the picture details are missing due to lossy compression for a 12MP camera model. CMOS sensor is better in compared to CCD said by experts, but same scene i captured in EPLH100(CMOS) and Sony W530(CCD) the Sony wins the race. After this i am really doubting the CANON CMOS capability. I thought of buying the SX40IS but i really doubt on CANON ability over Sony HX100v and Panasonic FZ150.Please avoid buying the ELPH series rather think of the these: Fuji F550,Canon 230HS, Sony WX9v, Nikon S8100 which are almost close to this range.""

The camera makes all the adjustments for you, so the photos come out great even if you don't know the right settings. Perfect for a teen who just wants to point & shoot. Also takes great video (Another big plus). She loves the color too (pink). At this price, i think Canon hit this one out of the park. Way to go Canon!!!""
"20111121","5.0","Pretty happy with this little guy","Picked up this camera after being severely disappointed with a new Fuji camera that I bought.  All I really want is a small camera that takes decent pictures in auto mode.  I have an SLR if I want to play with settings but with a small point and shoot camera, playing with the settings just isn't worth the hassle.  It has to work well and consistently with everything set to auto.  This does what I need it to do quite well.First of all, it's small.  Really small.  Very pocket-able.  The lens fully retracts and has a built in cap which is great.  The screen is big though relatively low resolution, but good enough for framing shots and being able to tell if the picture turned out.  The 4x zoom is fine given the size of the camera and the controls are easy to work.  The flash is on the opposite side from the shutter release so I'm less likely to hold the camera with my finger in front of it.As expected, picture quality in good light is very good.  Focus speed is good when you pre-focus the camera with very little shutter lag.  If you just mash the shutter button all the way down trying to get a quick shot it's not quite so fast, but that's not really the proper way to use the camera anyway.  Flash performance is decent and I have no complaints about white balance.  Low light performance is decent.  The camera seems to ramp up the ISO intelligently based on conditions and noise reduction vs. picture quality seems well balanced.One pleasant surprise was the video quality.  I never really considered video as much more than an afterthought with point and shoot cameras, but the results from this camera are actually pretty good.  Good enough that I realized how outdated my mini-DV camcorder was after seeing far superior video quality out of this point and shoot camera and prompting a camcorder upgrade.  A newer dedicated camcorder will give better results than what this camera can, but if I'm out and about and have the urge to shoot video and don't have the camcorder, the results from this camera will do just fine.Overall, this is a nice simple camera to use and gives me pretty good results.  That's all I really expected and it's nice that this camera meets my expectations.  And I like that it's blue.""

"20111116","2.0","strange orange/ yellowish color cast","Small compact camera, but unfortunately the adjustment buttons are hard to push ( i dont have large fingers ) and the image quality is lacking. I have gone through an SD870IS, SD890IS, SD300, SD450 so this is my 5th Canon compact. The picture quality, maybe due to CMOS instead of CCD, is definitely NOT as good as the previous 4 models I had. In addition, in auto mode, I often get a very yellowish picture. Software issue? Processing issue? Very frustrating. Even Photoshop has a hard time undoing the color damage. I took the camera back to where I bought it and tested out 3 other ELPH 100HS's and same thing: yellow color cast, given the right conditions.On the pro side - the flash adjusts itself well for closeup shots, as to not over expose.""

"20111104","5.0","Aesthetic and performance beauty","Bought this camera a few weeks back for my parents. A most excellent purchase. The camera's aesthetics are very pleasing, compact.. almost feels like a very smooth cellphone in your hand/pocket. Buttons are very intuitive. For the most part you can just leave it on auto and let the camera do most of the thinking..which suits the old folks just fine.Takes great pictures with and without flash. Without flash in low-light conditions is where it really shines. These pics may come out a bit softer than a regular camera, but with a lot less blur, so its a net positive by a mile. What matters is the pics in low-light no-flash conditions look a lot like how it is seen with the naked eye, so that was a huge difference over the previous point&shoots we've had.I also have a DSLR, but can't carry that around casually. This camera has convinced me that for such instances, cellphone cameras while ok, are still far behind.The only negative in my opinion was the lack of a view-finder. I personally like to use it when I want to switch off the display screen to conserve battery life. I guess now most people don't use it anyway, or are too used to viewing through the display screen for it to bother them.""

"20111027","4.0","Liking it so far","I grabbed on of these a few days ago after my old Powershot A570 IS decided that it would not accept batteries any longer.  I had that camera for 4 years, so it was time for a change.  The first thing that struck me about this camera was how small it is.  Almost too small.  The screen is great (bigger than my old camera), but the buttons are miniscule!  I got over that pretty quick, however, once I realized I could just pop this thing in my pocket and forget about it until I needed it.  So far I've had some moderate success in taking pictures.  I've noticed that there's a bit of noise unless I am completely still, but I'm still learning the camera.  Burst mode is pretty cool, but the pics are fairly low-res.  However I really like the continous mode, which is like Burst mode but takes a few less pics.If you are like me, and just want to have a low cost, handy point and shoot to take pics of the kids, I would recommend this camera.""
"20111026","4.0","lived up to expectations","I heard a lot of good things about this camera for this price range and for point and shoot cameras in general.  I have to say that it has exceeded those expectations.  First one of the most impressive features is the removable, rechargeble battery cartridge that has extremely long life.  I went to a wedding in Chicago and after 5 days probably about 150 pictures and a couple of 1 to 2 minute videos the battery was still full charged.  The second impressive quality is the video feature.  the videos it takes are extremely clear (possibly more clear than the pictures).  It would be nice to have more control of taking manual pictures but for the most part this camera works so well on auto that it wasn't much of an issue.  The only problem I had was trying to take pictures at night but that may have had more to do with my inexperience taking pictures than the camera itself since I was trying to take night shots of the lights on buildings far away using 4X zoom.  Overall I was very pleased with this camera.""
"20111026","4.0","Good video and quality with simple control, but doesn't always focus right","The camera takes nice pictures IF you hold it very still.  I don't ever have problems with our Nikon coolpix or Canon SLR XS but about 1 in 6 are blurry on this camera.  We bought it for the high rating of video quality and that is true it takes good video if it is focused before you start recording.  It has a simple easy to use menu with just the essential button like flash and timer available at your fingertips, you have to dig for the others.  We like this because what we use and only what we use is right there and easy to find. It has seperate buttons to start video or tke a picture which eliminates when you go to take a picture and realize you started a video and missed the picture.  Overall I really like the camera,especially for video, just wish it was better at stabilizing or would focus easier.""
"20111021","3.0","Love Canon, but camera is NOT durable at all","I loooove Canon PowerShots, I've owned roughly 6 of them in the past 6 years (Yes, SIX) and every time one breaks, I go and purchase the next and newest PowerShot model because I love them so much.  I find the interface so easy to use as a non-technical user, and the camera has always been one of most compact ones on the market so I just keep it in my purse 24/7 (because let's face it, most photo-worthy moments are not the ones you plan for..  The battery is awesome and holds a charge forever.  This newest model does not disappoint - although I have to admit that I never really see a huge difference in functionality/performance between each successive model, other than the greater megapixel capability.It is with a heavy heart, however, that I have decided to move on from my beloved Canon cameras.  The one huge issue I have found (and trust me, the fact that i've had 6 of these in the past 6 years should prove this) is that they are have no longevity - they are NOT hearty, easily breakable and delicate.  Between my numerous cameras, I've found the durability to be one of the poorest attributes of these cameras.  I can't always fault the manufacturer as some of my broken cameras were inevitably my fault, but there were some major problems that went wrong with some of these that should not have happened.  Here is a brief list of how my 6 cameras met their demise:1. Canon PowerShot SD200 - Had 2 years - Dropped off a stool. Yes, 100% my fault, but the stool was like 2 feet off the ground and the camera was totally dead afterwards!  So I'll say 90% my fault.2. Canon PowerShot SD300 - Had 10 months - When camera would turn on, lens got stuck and wouldn't come out. Perhaps dust or something got into it, but the lens refused to expand and contract and camera permanently and made a grinding noise instead.  Replacement lens was so expensive that camera repairman just recommended I buy a new camera.3. Canon PowerShot SD1000 - Had 5 months - LCD screen stopped working.  Camera could take pictures but wouldn't show up on screen.4. Canon PowerShot SD1200 - Had 5 months - Washed into the ocean (100% boyfriend's fault)5. Canon PowerShot SD1300 IS - Had 1.5 years - Giant fuzzy black spot started appearing on the screen gradually.  It was so faint at first that it wasn't a big deal, but now it's so dark it makes people look like they don't have heads in photos.  Very scary.6. Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS - Currently own.So two of these problems I will completely take fault for, but the rest of them just kind of randomly happened over time.  As a result, even though I love these cameras and have been incredibly loyal to Canon for a long time, I'm not sure I can continue to afford purchasing a new camera every year.  Beautiful camera and great pictures, but not durable.""

SLR cameras and even Canon's Advanced High End Digital Cameras are too bulky for me. They also have a lot of features that I never use, so I decided to buy one of Canon's ELPH cameras.My first test for the camera was a three day trip to NYC. It did great. It was small enough that I hardly noticed it in my front pocket. I took pictures all day, and I didn't need to charge the battery or download the photos to make room for more. I even took some video (video is great for kids who can't sit still long enough for a photo).I was very happy to find that Canon's software is still very easy to use. I just plugged in the camera to my computer, a program opened up to transfer the images, then ZoomBrowser opened up automatically when I closed the transfer program.I'll conclude my review here because if you need more information than this, then you probably should look into the higher end cameras.

I tried working with it for a couple hours but could not get good results at all.  Poor color, everything is too bright & looks blown out, software doesn't actually work on Windows 7 even with their update. I can get better pictures with my iPhone.

"20120413","1.0","Bad for zoom shots/landscape shots","I got this camera specifically to take pictures at a concert. the only pictures that came out decent were of us sitting in our seats. none of the distance shots came out, all were blurry. so now I have 12 MP blurry photos.I could have gotten the same results from my 3.2 MP 7 year old camera.

"20120412","4.0","Excellent Camera, Easy to Use","I purchased this camera to replace my aging Powershot SD870IS, which I had been very pleased with. The 100 HS exceeded my expectations. After reading several reviews and looking at images taken by this camera on various photo sharing websites, I decided to jump in.I only had it for about a month when I purchased one as a gift for my mother. The pictures are sharp and show great detail especially in low light. Canon has simplified the controls on the back making it not only look less cluttered, but kept changing the many settings simple. There is plenty of control in manual mode for those who make use of it, and fun to be had with the scene modes. (Miniature Effect is a personal favorite.)But where this camera really shines in the the automatic mode. It is truly a great point and shoot when you want it to be.Pros -Great photosEasy to use/change modesOutstanding battery life, I shot for almost 3 weeks, including several minutes of HD video, on a single charge.Small enough to fit in a pocket, yet large enough to be usable by larger hands (like mine)Cons -One minor complaint: the lighter construction doesn't feel as sturdy as the heavier metal body on my 870 IS.All in all, a fantastic camera, great for everyone.""
"20111019","5.0","Excellent as expected from Canon cameras","I bought this Canon ELPH 100 to replace my old Canon PowerShot SD750 which had a cracked lenses due to heavy use and one too many drops.  The ELPH takes excellent photos, is easy to understand, and uses the same SD card and NB-4L battery as the SD750.  I popped the old battery and SD card out of my old camera and into the new and kept shooting photos without missing a beat, while the new battery was charging and the new SD card is waiting in reserve.With all the specialization, it's a compliment to Canon that they kept their new camera interchangeable with the old.  Connection cords, battery, battery charger, SD card, and controls...all work.  There was a 5 minute learning curve, enough time to simply navigate through the menu to confirm everything was understandable.  This is my 4th Canon Powershot and I am very pleased with Canon.  These cameras are always with me.The size fits into my jeans or shirt pocket, and the feel of the camera is very good for my regular-sized hands.  Love it!  Thanks Canon, kudos for making a great product at a very good price.""

I bought it to take to Europe and left it on auto setting all of the time.

Then after using it about 4 months the screen started showing all kinds of vertical lines covering the entire screen from the bottom to almost the top.  At the top of the screen the lines became horizontal.  The pictures came out fine, but you could not see the icons at the top of the screen.  I sent it into Canon after talking with them.  And what they sent back was a refurbished camera with a shorter warranty period.  I am now trying to get my money back.....good luck with your camera and hope it continues to work.

"20110924","5.0","A seriously great little camera!","I researched point and shoot digital cameras under $100 for a month.  I know nothing about photography and don't own many gadgets.  But, before you decide that that automatically means my review can't mean much, hear me out.I've been wanting to start a blog and wanted to use my own pictures and videos.  I just wanted something with decent quality and was easy to use.  All of my research led me to first choose Canon over every other brand.  Then I found this camera.  It was in the under $200 category, which was more than I wanted to spend.  But, the more results I found online for this camera's videos and photos, I was hooked.  I bought it (at a Best Buy Midnight Sale for $149) and have had so much fun with it.  The first night I got it, I decided to take a walk and snap some pictures using ONLY the automatic settings.  When I came back and uploaded the images to my computer, I couldn't believe how great they looked!I went to a photography forum, posted my untouched photos, told how I just bought the camera and asked for opinions about it.  I got nothing but rave reviews about the camera and shock that the photos were my first attempt at photography.  They called them 'saleable'  and I was encouraged to look into selling them.  Someone guided me along with how to do it and, guess what?  I sold them!My point is this:  I might have a little natural talent when it comes to composition, but the quality was ALL in the camera... and ONLY on the automatic settings!  Imagine what this camera can do when I learn how to use the manual settings!P.S.  I almost upgraded to the 300 model instead of the 100 model because a few reviews I read said that, with the 100 model, you can't zoom while you're filming video.  I decided to save the money and stick with the 100 model anyway - and I'm glad I did.  The 100 model DOES zoom (quietly) while filming video.""

"20110917","5.0","4th times the charm","This is the 4th Canon Powershot we have owned and so far it is my favorite. I like that they moved the manual/auto button to the top of the camera, rather than the back. And I really like that there is a totally seperate button for recording. In the past it has been in conjunction with the manual/auto button, so MANY times I would go to take a picture and it would be in record mode. Much easier to avoid that problem now. Also, the screen is larger than in the past. And I LOVE the orange color!""
"20110915","5.0","Great little camera","This is an excellent little camera.  In many situations, it takes pictures of comparable quality to my Rebel XS.  The optical image stabilization puts it solidly above most point-and-shoot cameras I've used.I bought this because it's just about the smallest real camera I could find, and I wanted something I could easily carry with me.  The only drawback to this is that the buttons on the back are quite small and can be a pain to use.  On the plus side, the interface is very straightforward and there's no selection wheel full of options I'll never use.  Another refreshing change from other cameras I've used is that the camera explains the significance of most settings, so even those you don't use very often won't confuse you.Video quality is also pretty good.  It'll take 1080p videos, but only at 24 frames per second, which generally looks jerky.  I much prefer the results at 720p.  Zoom and autofocus do not work during video recording, but you aren't stuck with webcam-style fixed focus, you simply have to set zoom and focus before starting to record.  I think this has something to do with the microphone picking up the noise caused by the moving parts in the lens.  You can also take slow-motion video at up to 240 frames per second, which is a neat trick - although 240fps is not always fast enough to capture a whole lot of detail you can't see anyway.""

"20110905","2.0","buttons difficult to manipulate","I always have inspected a purchase in person before buying online.  This time I felt I didn't need to as I've always been happy with my Canon purchases.  Big mistake.  The buttons on this ELPH 100 HS 12 MP camera are nearly impossible to manipulate.  My fingers get cramped up and I have to try a couple of times to press the buttons.  And I'm not a meat cleaver handed man either, nor am I a woman with long daggers.  I'm just a woman with average length nails, about 1/4' longer than my finger tips.  The buttons are small and sunk in a little, it actually hurts some to depress the buttons.  I don't have complaints about the picture quality, but since its not very usable for me, it doesn't make me happy and I've hardly used it as a result.  I should return this thing, but I wonder if too much time has transpired.""

When playback on our 46'' TV, the videos are sharp and the pictures are very good.Good for indoor and outdoor use.Pros: good quality of HD videos, light weight and small size, easy to use, good performance under low-light condition.Cons: sometimes the focus is not good when taking videos(3 or 4 times so far, in about 50 days), battery life (I bought 3 more batteries for my father, so this won't be a problem for me).After I bought this, i never use our camcorder anymore.""

"20110829","4.0","Great pocket camera","I pre ordered this camera (sight unseen) before it even came out, and it did not disappoint.  It is tiny, even for an Elph, and the photos are far better than any previous Elph I've owned.  (I've owned four now.)  The screen is nice and big, although it got a scratch within 1 week... something that had never happened to any of my previous Elphs over a period of 10 years.  I guess that's what happens when the glass is so huge.My biggest complaint is about the ridiculously tiny controls.  I have slender fingers and can use most small electronics without a problem.  This is VERY HARD to use because the buttons are EXTREMELY small.  The D-pad is barely usable.  Fortunately, the flip side is that the automated scene selection feature has been improved so much that you almost never have to use the D-pad or other controls.  Basically, I just shoot in auto mode all the time and all the photos come out fine.  Once in a while, I'll switch to the program mode so I can shoot the kids running around, but mostly I don't need the controls any more.  This was a real paradigm shift for me after so many years of constantly adjusting the ISO and exposure of my Elphs to get the lighting just right.Having said that, I am still a habitual deleter of excess photos while they are still in the camera, and the lack of a delete button is a serious design flaw.  To delete a single photo, I have to press the ridiculously small buttons 4-5 times.  To delete a bunch of photos, I just sit there pressing (or mis-pressing) buttons for 10 minutes.  I guess if you are the type of person who simply manages your photos after they are on the computer, you won't have this problem.  But my spouse is always filling up the memory card, and then I end up having to delete dozens of pix or movies to make more space on the camera.I guess the only other flaw I would point out is that the camera is so small, and the glass is so large, there's almost no way to take a photo without sticking your thumb directly on the glass and smearing it.These are all somewhat minor gripes compared to the quality of the images that the camera takes and the benefits of having such a compact camera.  I also love the color options so that I no longer get my camera mixed up with someone else's.  For the price, this is a really top-notch point and shooter... with 1080p HD!""

"20110817","1.0","I expected more from canon","I wanted to like this camera, I truly did. Picture quality is pretty poor. Sure it has some cool features, but I could care less if my pictures turn out blurry and dull. Maybe it works great if you are only taking pictures of scenery (since there is little movement). Taking pictures of animals or children is a huge problem. When in auto mode, the camera rarely uses the flash and the pictures turn out blurred and grainy. The video is just atrocious! It is not focused and crisp as it should be. I previously owned a sony cybershot (which my friend dropped on concrete) that I loved! It took excellent videos and pictures and was easy to use. I went with a canon thinking I would be more than satisfied and I am left wondering what all the hype is about. The price is high and there just really isn't a darn thing to write home about. IT is fragile and slippery and if you were to drop it (which you will because the casing has no grip to it) I have no doubt it would break.

"20110813","5.0","Works for ME!","I am a very casual photographer, wanting few bells and whistles, and a camera to be simple to operate - but still able to capture quality pictures of my grandchildren. I've only had this camera for a few days, but so far it seems to completely fit the bill. Within a few minutes of opening the box I had snapped several great pics, although inadvertently I also took several video clips of the ground too, lol. A few minutes later I had deleted the video clips and emailed the pics to my family to show off my new camera. It really doesn't get much simpler than that. I especially like the large viewing ability as it helps me take pics with a sense of confidence that 'here is the moment' cause I can make out the details so well. I have also printed the pics out on my printer and they are good, although darker than it appears on screen - but perhaps this is my printer, not the camera. I have to play around with that. I have heard others express concern about taking pics in low light with this camera, but I haven't tried that yet. Over the next month or so I will give the camera a workout as I have 2 granchildren being born within a month of each other. For now, though, I think this camera is perfect for me.""

"20110808","5.0","Everything I wanted and more","This camera is exactly what I was looking for.  I had previously had an older model (by a year or two) and was pleased with it, and hoped that nothing significant was changed that would decrease the quality.  Well I was really pleased when this came in the mail.  The new features of Super Slow Motion, and Recording in full 1080p are absolutely incredible.Other modes of shooting includeAuto- This mode is just what it says, and it has some pretty great versatilityProgram- In this mode you can choose what colors you want to emphasize, as well as what lighting you're using, or continuous shutter modeMovie digest-Takes a clip with each shot to make a day's summary(I've never really used it, this is just the description that the camera gives)Portrait- Good for people shotsKids and pets- Good for faster moving objectsSmart Shutter-  Okay this one is way freakin' cool.  The camera apparently 'knows' when you're smiling, and in this mode it'll just take pictures on it's own if it sees anyone smiling.  It's half freaky, half freakin' awesomeHigh Speed Burst- This is for those moments when you only have a moment, and you want to catch someone in the air, or something else really crazy like that, where there isn't much time.  Basically you hold down the button, and it keeps taking pictures in ultra quick succession.  I've used it a bunch to get those sweet mid-air shots.Best image selection- This mode takes three pictures at once, and chooses the 'best quality one'  I'm not sure how it does that, but it does.handheld night scene- I haven't used this, but it's kinda self descriptivelowlight- It cuts back on MP, and gets a good clear shot.  This is actually one of the fortes of Cannon Cameras is great photos in low light.  I can attest.Fish-eye effect- I guess if you're a skater it's cool right?  It's also adjustable so that all of the shots don't look the same.miniature effect-  This one was totally new to me, and rather fun.  Basically it makes anything you take a picture of look like a tiny toy, or just plain tiny.  It was waaay to much fun to use.Toy camera effect- It darkens the edges to 'Create a distinctive feel' LOL.monochrome- Cool word for black and whiteSuper vivid- Just thatposter effect- It gives photos that 'poster effect'  I'm not sure how to relate this.  You'll have to find out when you pick up the camera.  It does look cool though.Color Accent- It gives you the ability to highlight one color, and the rest of the photo is in black and white.  This is possibly my favorite modeColor Swap- you select two colors, and one color is replaced by the other.  This mode can get kinda trippy sometimes, but it pretty entertaining.  I'll also add that when you're selecting a color, you're actually choosing the color out of the real world, so there isn't a stupid menu you have to choose from or something.  You choose what's actually there.Beach-Pictures with lotsa sunlightunderwater- I haven't tried this one, mostly because... I don't want to mess up my camera.  You can get an underwater case for this model.  There are actually two different types.  One is 50ish, and another is actually the very price of the camera to begin with... a little too much for me, but apparently great for scuba diving...Foliage- Get those green shotssnow-Totally useless in Texas where I'm at, but Pretty good when I was in RussiaFireworks- It really works the best for fireworks.  Go figure.Long Shutter- This is for night stuff where you want the shutter to take in more light.Stitch Assist- This is supposed to help with the creating of panorama shots, but it doesn't actually mend them together, so I found it a little useless. You can also start from either sideWhew... That was a long list.  I must mention that you can take video from EVERY MODE.  This is ultra cool in monochrome, color accent, or color swap.Basically take my advice.  Buy the Camera.  I did loads of research myself (which of course I encourage you to do), and if you want super photos, but perhaps aren't a photographer, then go for this.  If you are a photographer then I would say that it handles esp. well.  Go for it!Also I'm updating this review, because my Camera lens got jammed.  So I went and shipped it to the cannon repair center, and I had a brand new one in 4 days flat.  I had heard of it taking upwards of 2 weeks.  Not so with me.  Also when I sent it back to be repaired I took the battery, and sd card out.  When they shipped a new one, it came with a brand new battery.  Talk about awesome.  The customer service is Amazing!""

With the 1400, it was almost impossible to take a focused shot in macro mode.  The autofocus was accurate when you pushed halfway down on the button, but once you pushed down further to take the actual pic, it as as often as not lost focus.Now theres the ELFH 100HS, which has the opposite problem.  It's fine in macro mode, but for any other type of shots, the autofocus doesn't work.

Just point and shoot; the camera does most of the work for you.Battery factor:  excellent battery life.  Best yet, you can get an extra battery and charge it up easily with a charger that plugs directly.Conclusion: get your butt off the chair and buy that Canon Elph 100 HS!""

"20110724","4.0","Pink Canon Powershot HS 100","I mainly bought this camera for the HS function. The HS function is supposed to make it possible to take pretty good pictures in low light without having to use the flash, however this doesnt seem very accurate. I've tried many areas of low light, and the pictured came out looking sort of bad. The HS function needs a good amount of light to work properly in my experience.The other camera functions it came with, such as the miniature and fish eye effects, are pretty good. However, if your camera is switched to Auto mode, you cant use any of these fun features.As for the video quality, it isn't so bad either, provided you have a good amount of light in the room/area you're in,  otherwise your video will be really dark and indistinguishable.As for the look of the camera itself, although its advertised as pink, its more of a pinkish-purple color.""

It shoots in dim lighting (night time) pretty well granted you have a few light sources around (they don't have to be bright light sources, in other words).720p always looks great and the photo quality is great.Battery life is amazing too! For a few days, I was turning it off & on quite a bit, recording a few short vids, taking pictures, browsing and editing, and after two days it finally died on me.OH ya, you can crop videos too...within the camera. Chop off a bit, or a lot, of the beginning &/or end whenever you want. Then save the new video or add it to your collection on your memory card.BTW, I have a 16GB, CLASS 6 SDHC Memory Card. Anything below CLASS 6 won't get you the HD quality for 720p if I understand correctly.Great price (especially for a college student like myself) for a fantastic little camera.""

This last time, I went to the beach with my son (he's 1 and it was his first trip.

Nothing else seems to make a lot of sense given price and performance.**************Addition 8/3/2011 - I am finding that with the video you need to ensure the camera has focused prior to hitting the record button.  This is especially true when zoomed in all the way.  I was getting a high percentage of out of focus videos when zoomed in until I figured this out.  So you half press the shutter button to focus like you are going to take a picture and then after it focuses, hit video record.  A little disappointing given how happy I have been with everything else, but easy enough to work around.""

"20110708","4.0","Canon ELPH 100 HS - good everyday camera","I have a bunch of digital cameras, from older-and-low-resolution-but-still-useful to newer and fancy. Most but not all have been from Canon, since in my evaluations they have the best all around combination of quality company, support, features, build quality, price, user interface, etc. In the middle of my has been my trusty Canon PowerShot A510, a camera I bought years ago for the sole purpose of quickly shooting images from projected slides (a project to create a quick catalog of slides I had stored in carousels). But over the years the old A510 has been starting to get a bit long in the tooth, although it still takes good everyday pictures and remains reliable enough.I decided it was time to replace the A510 because I need to manually fiddle with the automatic lens cover mechanism, almost every time I turn the camera on, to get it to open fully.I did not want to sped a lot of money, but I wanted something with a similar level of utility to the A510. After a lot of evaluating, I settled on the Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS. Like the A510, it has similar optics, and the zoom is also an optical 4X. The size in the hand is almost identical, although the new one is about half as thick.One thing I always thought Canon did very well with their digital cameras is the user interface. And that interface was pretty consistent across their lineup, so that most functions were done the same way on all my Canons, using the same or at least very similar buttons and controls. The new ELPH 100 dispenses with the older tradition, and does some things differently.On the older system there was a thumb operated knob on top for selecting AUTO plus several common modes such as Portrait, Landscape, Night, Sports/Action, Panorama, and a few variations of Manual mode. The new system replaces the knob with a two position selector on top which is essentially AUTO and ALL ELSE. When in AUTO, the camera evaluates the composition of your picture and decides which mode to use automatically. When in ALL ELSE, the LCD screen presents those other modes for your manual selection using the Up/Down/Left/Right navigation control on the back of the camera. This is slightly more difficult than using the knob, but not too much more so.An improvement over the older system is that the Movie button is a separate control, so you can start shooting your movie immediately by pressing the button, instead of needing to turn the knob of navigate through a menu. Unlike some of the bigger Canon cameras, the ELPH 100 does not allow simultaneous movie and still photo shooting. But if you are shooting a movie and press the shutter button twice, the first press cancels the movie and the second press takes the still photo. You could then press the movie button again and resume shooting the movie with only a couple seconds lost. Also, the ELPH 100 does not allow changes to exposure after the move shoot has started, although it does allow zoom and auto focus changes during the shoot.In AUTO, the ELPH 100 automatically goes into macro mode when you get close to an object. In ALL ELSE, you can select several options in this regard.The ELPH 100 uses the red/orange lamp on the front as a surrogate flash bulb for red-eye reduction, as opposed to firing an early flash to close down the subject person's pupils. The lamp is very bright in this case, but at other times is is less bright for other indications such as timer mode count down.The ELPH has several combinations of photo quality/resolution, and allows you to select between four movie quality settings; two are widescreen HD, and two are stand aspect ratio video. The various ALL ELSE modes that apply to still photos can also be applied to movies.As will all Canons, the still photo trigger control (shutter release) is both a button AND a rotating, spring return to center zoom control. Using the zoom while in picture taking mode will zoom optically first, then will adjust digital zoom if held for a longer time. Using the zoom while in picture viewing (playback) mode will allow close inspection of pictures you already took (use the navigation control pad to pan around inside the zoomed in view), and will also turn the LCD viewfinder into a photo gallery of taken pictures and movies, allowing for quickly jumping around in your collection.Another departure from some older models is that there is no longer a clear-cut selector switch for choosing picture taking mode versus picture viewing mode. Instead, there is a button that puts the camera into viewing mode, and pressing the shutter release trigger button puts it back into picture taking mode.The ELPH 100 comes with a video cable that has both HDMI and standard PCD audio and composite video connectors for connecting to your TV. It also comes with a USB cable, although the camera manual does not indicate that the battery can be charged via USB; it only mentions charging by way of the included AC wall charger that the battery fits into (i.e. you must remove the battery from the camera).The ELPH 100 takes standard SD memory cards as well as SDHC and SDXC and MultiMedia cards, MMC-Plus cards, and Eye-Fi cards (the latter is not guaranteed to work). NOTE: the ELPH 100 does NOT come with a memory card, and you cannot use the camera without the card. In the old days, digital cameras came with a small memory cord just so you could at least play around with it before buying a larger card, but this is no longer true. The camera is often bundled with a memory card by the retailer, just keep your eyes open when buying.A big departure from the older A510 and its relatives is the use of a proprietary rechargeable battery as opposed to standard AA batteries. I really liked being able to travel with a couple sets of AA's and a wall charger, and be able to use those charged batteries in any of the cameras I had according to need. With the new camera I will be locked into the special battery. It is easy to get this camera bundled (by Amazon and by stores) with a second battery, so at least I can have a charged spare on hand. The newer batteries DO allow for a thinner and lighter weight camera, and the Lithium-Ion technology charges very quickly and lasts a long time.I will not go into specifics of 'how good are the pictures'. The pictures are very good, and you can make them even better by going into manual mode(s). At the price range of the ELPH 100, the photo quality is at least competitive with other brands and models.""

My only reason for the return was the fixed focus and no zoom-in/out during video recording, which my 2-year-old Canon SD1100 IS could do.  It otherwise seemed to be a very good camera for an amazing price--good picture quality, good selections of picture modes, various ISO settings, etc.  I'd believe this would be a very good camera if you do not care for video recording.  However, if you do use this camera for video recording as well, it would not be a good choice and you may consider the 300HS instead.""
"20110626","5.0","Everything I wanted for a point and shoot","I previously had a Cannon Elph and LOVED IT! I had taken it to the beach, got sand in the lens and it never worked again.I tried another brand of camera and it couldn't hold a candle to the Elph. Returning to the Elph felt like going home again ;-)I am by no means a professional photographer so this does everything for me.  I leave the setting on 'auto' and when taking pictures it adjusts itself to the proper setting.  Now I don't have to figure out what to do if I am outside in low light with a moving dog.  I just click and BAM!  A great photo!I also love the battery that comes with the camera.  Charge it for an hour it last for at least 4-5hrs.  No need to buy batteries and worry about having extras with you.  The battery charger is super compact so say you are going to a wedding and only have a clutch purse/suit jacket you could easily bring with you. Its small and super light weight.So to summarize....the camera is AWESOME!PS - I bought the camera through the Amazon store and it was shipped super duper fast and in perfect condition.""
"20110625","5.0","An excellent camera with a wide variety of features","I'm a mechanic. A small digital camera is almost always on my belt for quick access. I need a need a quick-start camera that's fast, easy-to-use that stores good EXIF information (leaving my iPad and Blackberry out of contention).After owning two Nikon digital cameras I purchased my first Canon in 2008, the SD750 (aka `old camera'). It worked well until getting caught by a closing car-hood.I purchased the ELPH 100 from Office Depot the same day the old camera was damaged thanks to their helpful employees. I didn't read reviews until after the purchase, noting there are more 5-star reviews than all the lower ratings combined.The learning curve was short with many similarities to the old camera, yet with a number of new features.Most of my shots are at 640x480 resolution to facilitate uploading to my websites and emailing to customers. A number of photos are taken under the hood and near the instrument panel; macro image quality is important, especially in low-light conditions.Some short handheld videos are recorded for youtube presentation; video quality that's 'good enough' will work.Under $200 USImage stability with overrideShort power-on to shoot timeGood low light and macro capability for shots 3~6 inchesPlusses:+ The 'Movie Digest' mode stores 3 seconds of video before each photo and stitches these together into a daily video summary. A nice feature to review 'what did I do today'. Faster/easier than looking at all the photos taken during the day.+ 'Smart Auto' feature automatically switches modes and informs me via the display.+ flash: on, off, auto in all modes (that I've used so far).+ Ergonomics: the size is 'just right', fitting perfectly into a Nite Ize clip case . I looked at the ELPH 300 and it's just a little too small for my tastes.+ Usability: All the functions are easy to access.+ Usability 'Hints and Tips'; short reminders at the bottom of the screen. Turn 'em off after you've become a power-user.+ Excellent documentation.+ Contacted Canon support on 3 occasions over the past 10 years; their phone, email, and chat-based support are excellent.+ HDMI 1080P movie capability, remote control via HDMI w/remote.+ Categories: user-assigned, 'favorites' and others. Assign a category to a customer- slideshow playback shows only their car.Minuses:- Documentation: The PDF manuals are watermarked; I find this annoying.- Ergonomics: Buttons on the back are flush with the body. Teaching yourself how to push the buttons properly has a learning curve. After using the camera for a week I am starting to know what to push without having to look at the buttons.- no manual means of folder management (not aware of any &lt;$200 camera with this).Summary: for under $200 the photo quality, size, speed, and nice display screen I am pleased. I'm pleased with the photo-taking and features. My customers like the screen and playback features, pleasant when they're paying me hundreds or thousands of dollars. They have to 'like what they see', and I have to 'like what I do'; this camera helps all of us.""

"20110617","2.0","Small Size, Low Noise But Soft Photos, No Digital Zoom in 3:2","I have the Canon PowerShot A80, A620, and SD800 IS.  The photos from the SD800 IS are not as clean as the photos of the older A-model Canons with slightly larger sensors and lower megapixels, but the photos are reasonably sharp and the SD800 IS is more compact than my older A models for everyday carry.  However, small cameras with small flashes with limited flash range would benefit from better low-light-higher-ISO capabilities -- my SD800 IS takes photos at ISO 1600 that look quite grainy or noisy.  So I decided to check out the Canon HS models for the low-light-high-ISO capabilities.  I wanted an HS model that was smaller than my SD800 and I did not want to pay too much for a camera that I was not completely sure about, so I put the cheapest ELPH 100 HS model in my Amazon.com cart.  When the price dropped by $20 and Super Saver Shipping was offered, I ordered the 100 HS in April and have been carrying the camera as my everyday camera and using it for nine weeks.The 100 HS is lighter and much thinner than my SD800, although it is actually a little longer.  The screen is much bigger and takes up most of the back of the camera -- it is great for reviewing photos.  But the control wheel is smaller and is a little trickier to use -- I kept pressing the wrong way and needed additional attempts to get things changed.  With fewer external controls on the back than the SD800, the 100 HS required more use of the menus.  The smaller size of the 100 HS is an important attraction for me, but it comes with some disadvantages -- there is little to grab onto, so I use the wrist strap to help in avoiding drops.In low light, the higher ISO capabilities of the 100 HS have been impressive.  The photos look really less grainy or noisy and the colors have looked pretty good.  However, zooming in on the photos reveal soft images and lack of detail, so the noise reduction results in loss of sharpness.  Photos taken with the flash within the limited flash range and lower ISO are noticeably sharper than the photos taken without the flash and higher ISO.  Although I used to see reviews that said that ELPH cameras produced photos that were very sharp, the reviews on the 100 HS indicate that its resolution is a bit low and is average at best, not sharp, so the high ISO noise reduction appears to be only part of the reason why the photos look so soft.  My SD800 IS, which is not the sharpest camera out there, produces sharper looking photos than the 100 HS.When I decided to use the 100 HS's flash more from within the flash's range in order to get sharper photos, I encountered another problem -- the flash photos showed a color cast and were less pleasing than the photos taken without the flash.  This was surprising to me, because I have not gotten this result with any of my other Canon cameras -- so I had to do some color correction with Adobe Photoshop Elements.  After getting that screwy flash color result, I compared the colors of photos taken under different lighting conditions taken with the 100 HS and the SD800.  The SD800 produced photos with more accurate colors than the 100 HS.  However, the difference is only noticeable if you compare the photos taken with the 100 HS against photos taken of the same objects with other cameras or if you compare the photos with the original objects photographed, so the 100 HS's colors may be satisfactory to you, especially if you use the 'Vivid' or other color setting.Because I usually print photos in the 4X6-inch size, I set the aspect ratio at 3:2 instead of 4:3.  When I changed the aspect ratio, I lost the digital zoom.  I learned from Canon that the digital zoom works only in the 4:3 aspect ratio.  As others have already pointed out, the optical zoom of the 100 HS is not available for video, so any zooming has to be with the digital zoom.  If you set the 100 HS for the aspect ratio 3:2 or 16:9 and you plan to zoom during a video with the digital zoom, you should set the aspect ratio to 4:3 before starting the video.After reading more comments and reviews, I concluded that there is a price paid for the compactness and low-light capabilities of this camera.  Other cameras that are a bit bigger may be better suited for those who are looking for a primary camera.  For family and office events, I have my other Canons and my Nikon D90 SLR to use, so I do not have to rely only on the ELPH 100 HS.  If a compact Canon ELPH is nevertheless desired, I would suggest that a 300 HS for about $50 more should be considered.""
"20110616","2.0","Not really impressed.","I bought this camera from a local Staples store, and then a couple of days later I took it back to that store for a refund. I already knew that the ELPH100 disabled the zoom when in movie mode; that was no problem since I'm not a fan of zooming in and out while the video is rolling. What I didn't know was that the autofocus is also crippled. Now, what good is a point and shoot camera that doesn't maintain focus?The whole point of a point and shoot is that you can point it at something and get a decent picture--or video--without having to waste time fumbling around with settings while the action around you passes by. After all, life waits for no one. Especially children or grandchildren.If it was just the movie-autofocus problem, I would have been tempted to keep the darn thing, and I was close to doing just that. But no...I had to go ahead and test the pointy-eared, little ELPH's picture quality against my old, 5MP, brick-like, troll-of-a-Sony. (Seriously! With its fat, weighty little, metal body; you could really hurt someone with that ancient thing if you whipped it around by its wrist strap.)The picture quality of the Canon ELPH isn't really that bad, but when you consider that it has a technological leap of seven or eight years over the clunky Sony, it's far less than impressive. The outdoor shots looked harsh and the highlights more than a little blown out. And the colors? Well, our green garbage can looked yellower than I ever imagined it. Sure, the sun was bright on that day here in Florida, but my old Sony Cybershot didn't seem to have a problem with it. Colors with the Sony looked much more natural and as true as one of these cheap little cameras can get.Some might say that it's not fair to judge the Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 solely on its preset, automatic features. To that, I say again; isn't that the point of a point and shoot?""
"20110611","5.0","So many features! The worst part of this camera is the wrist strap.","This camera is amazing! They have packed so much into this tiny package. My last Canon PS1200 was stolen at Disneyland, otherwise I would've never bought a new one - that was a great camera! But now that I have this one I'm realizing how far Canon has come in just a few short years! My one and only complaint is the terrible wrist strap! But that's an easy fix.""
"20110530","5.0","Very happy with the Canon ELPH 100 HS (Grey)!","The Canon ELPH 100 HS is beautiful, and the Smart Auto feature takes great, no-stress photos for the user who has little or no experience with camera equipment.Before buying the Canon ELPH 100, I read reviews and did a lot of research online to find a point-and-shoot camera that I would enjoy within the under-$200 price range.  There are a lot of good products from which to choose.I next went to Best Buy, Office Depot, and Sears to hold different point-and-shoot cameras made by the major producers:  Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, etc.  For me, these visits to different retailers is an important part of the process of buying a point-and-shoot digital camera for the first time.Another important step is to learn whether or not the camera's software is compatible with your desktop computer.  Because my computer is old (2006), I had to research compatibility with the different cameras that I liked.  You can find the information at the product websites.Canon has a very user-friendly website that influenced my purchase considerably.I had XP Service Pack 2 on an older Dell Dimension E310.  For the Canon, I had to download XP Service Pack 3.I ordered the camera from Amazon.com.  From the moment I opened the box of the Canon ELPH 100 HS, I liked everything that I saw.  The instructions are clear and organized well.Finally, I love the pictures that I am taking.  No, they are not the same quality as those taken by friends and family members who own thousands of dollars worth of camera equipment.  However, these photos are beautiful and fun to take.I am practicing now so that I will be ready to take photos at baby showers and graduations in the next couple of weeks.Is it easy to learn how to use the Canon ELPH 100 HS?  It is VERY easy to learn how to use Smart AUTO.  The sliding Smart AUTO button is on the top of the camera:  you slide the latch to Smart AUTO, and you are finished.  The camera 'decides' whether or not to activate flash and also determines other settings.To learn to use all of the optional features (P mode) is fun but not essential to photographing great photos right away.Another reason that I bought the Canon ELPH 100 is that it is considered to be among the best in its price range -- and possibly THE BEST -- in low-light conditions.  The only time the colors seemed to be distorted somewhat was when I took photos of pets sitting in a semi-darkened room while they were directly under the strong light of a table lamp.  I found that the bright light from the lamp washed over all objects close to the lamp; the objects outside of the lamplight were fainter in color.  Since then, I've taken the precaution of composing photos more carefully so that I am not creating a spotlight effect.I read that the ELPH 300 could be a better choice if you plan to use the video features a lot.  For me, the video features on the ELPH 100 are fine.While in Playback (viewing photos that I have taken), I am learning how to use the displayed menus to select options such as Slideshow and Erase -- so far, so good.  While not as easy as Smart Auto, the menus are fairly intuitive.I have been very pleased.  The sheen of the dog's coat, the warm expression in her eyes, and the mysterious, bold gaze of the cat -- all captured beautifully.""
"20110530","4.0","A good pocket camera","First, the large LCD screen makes shooting without a viewfinder as easy as it can possibly be (without a viewfinder). The camera shoots quickly for a pocket digital and does a great job of maintaining focus. The resolution on pictures is really good. It's a bit of a pain to delete pictures (shouldn't require so many steps), but it's easy to scroll through the photos you've just taken and these features respond quickly, which is a nice feature given the large file size of the images the camera takes (aka the high resolution of the photos).""

I just went through the almost 800 photos and 40 something short video clips on my 8 GB SDHC card.  Almost all of them taken on steady ground are excellent, videos of the crashing waves and rushing rivers will provide an occasional fix for this Midwestern resident....many of the stills look professional.  Also many of those taken through train or rental car windows very quickly as we  raced along are very clear and provide great memories.  After reading the reviews about the focus not adjusting during video, I mostly kept the camera steady, but the few where I slowly panned the whole scene for documentation purposes were also very clear.""

"20110425","4.0","Pleased with performance","When upgrading to a new camera, I was also considering a Coolpix based on reviews, but decided to pay extra and get this ELPH for several features I knew I'd use a lot:  slow-mo video, tilt-shift miniature filter, isolated color filter, and fisheye.Coming from an Olympus C-60, the ELPH 100 HS is a huge upgrade.  The C-60 was a couple of technological generations ago, and didn't have image stabilization, which makes the biggest difference.  This is particularly noticeable when taking no-flash photos.I paired this with an 8GB Class 10 card and it is snappy.  Some people have complained about delay between pictures, but I am completely satisfied in this respect, and I wonder if the memory card speed has something to do with it.The only disappointments I have with the ELPH 100 HS is I thought the best-pic-of-three feature was standard, but it's one of the non-auto shooting modes.  Macro is also only available in non-auto modes, so it's kind of annoying to have to switch modes, scroll to the non-filtered option, and then turn the macro on.  The quality of the photos is sometimes disappointing - low-light photos tend to be grainy, and with other photos (haven't determined the precise causes yet) the color seems overly vivid.  With most of my other cameras, Photoshop's auto-levels/contrast/color would almost always improve the picture, but with this camera those Photoshop features usually make it worse, so I spend more time manually correcting.Overall, very happy with the camera.  Picture quality could be better, but it is not bad for the price range.  Size of the camera is awesome, way more easily pocket-able than my previous Olympus.  The battery life is phenomenal.""

The assorted color options are fun, pairing well with what I would describe as a fun camera. I will admit that it is basic, but if you're looking for a point-and-shoot camera that is easy to use and does all the work for you, then this is it.I am such a fan that I will gladly fork over the money to get another for a Mother's Day gift.ENJOY!!""

When i was looking for a camera I was looking for Something with fun features that also took really great shots And took them rather quickly Chasing after two kiddos (7 and 3) I need a quick camera. So far this has meet my needs for a camera very well.""
"20110417","5.0","Great Upgrade from older models","My last point and shoot was about seven years old so it was time for an upgrade. I bought this the other day in a store but I'll review it here.Bottom line: It's a great pocket camera with a huge screen.Canon has added dozens of features since my last camera making it totally worth the upgrade. If you have one from a year or two ago it probably isn't worth the upgrade unless you broke it however.The macro mode isn't the greatest so if you want it for that maybe get something better. The focus isn't fast on it for closeups. I added photos to show you what I mean. I like taking pictures of flowers sometimes but not enough to return the camera, I can just give it a minute.Low light is good, there is some noise but overall for a sub $200 camera it is decent. Videos are also very good with much improved sound.Minor issues: The camera is pretty much backwards from old cameras. The button layout is totally different so if you're switching it may take a few days to get used to. The buttons themselves are flush with the casing and small too so if you have bigger hands this may not be the camera for you. Thankfully I have small hands but I find myself so used to raised buttons that I end up having to look at what I'm doing.Coolest features: Movie digest, high speed shooting and smile shutter. :)""

This camera is wonderful, strongly built, attractive, shoots great pics and very very decent HD video (I am comparing to my HD camcorder HF20). You can shoot 1 hr of full (1080p) on a 16 GB SD card, 2hrs on a 32GB. Recording 720p (which is still super clear) gives you even more shooting time..But of course this isn't a camcorder although the above is a major plus. The still pics are really nice. I always opt for auto as I am still an amateur photographer.. The elph 300HS seems like it has a couple more extra specs , but for me they weren't as important.This is a solid point and shoot with a very attractive exterior and pricetag.. 5 stars from me!""
"20110405","4.0","Good but no Video zoom - Get the 300 HS","The product description for the Canon 100 HS and the 300 HS are very similar and it appears to be mostly just the wide angle and zoom. I compared the two cameras in the store and preferred the look and feel of the grey 100 HS. Only when I was testing the camera did I realize that the 100 HS does not allow you to zoom while shooting video. Another missing feature of the 100 HS is the smart auto scene detection is not active when shooting video. If you don't care about video, save $50 on the 100 HS otherwise get the 300 HS. I exchanged mine and love the 300 HS.""

"20110318","5.0","Canon ELPH 100 HS -- U R going to luv it","Just received my Canon ELPH 100 HS {orange} and I absolutely love it. The camera boots up almost instantly. Installed a 16GB SDHC class 10 card and now have 5000+ 12MB photo capacity or 60 minutes for HD video. The image stabilization at max digital zoom 4X4/16x works great! The camera easily fits in my pocket and is very light @ ~5 ounces.The Canon's Digic 4 processor & CMOS sensor make this camera truly point and shoot. By default it automatically selects the light level, shaking, target focus, shutter speed, flash/noflash and ISO to pick the optimal scene type. Perfect pictures virtually every time when button is correctly pressed 1/2 way (1) before fully in (2) for photo shot. But be sure to get a class 10 card for the best video.The only 2 minor problems I believe are:1) It comes with a 700 mAh 3.7 Volt battery instead of the 1400 mAh 3.7 OEM version which doubles it run-time for 230 photos to almost 500 pictures per charge. This is easily fixed when ordering additional batteries just get the larger mAh capacity ones.2) The CameraWindow transfer software doesn't automatically delete pictures after they are transferred. Some people like this as not to delete photos improperly transferred.(I do not). Some camera blogs suggest a quick format after transfer is the way to quickly delete photos/video after successful transfer.However, this is the best point and shoot camera I have used and I still think it's a 5 star camera @ $199 MSRP.""
"20110317","4.0","Very Nice Camera","Canon Elph 100 HS Pros and ConsPros- Good looking and small- Nice large 3.0 inch LCD screen- Very good photo quality! When using this camera, I suggest you keep in auto mode. Its a really good auto mode unlike other auto modes on other digital cameras. You will always get a sharp shot with less grain. The HS system really helps.- Very good 1080p for a small camera.-  Cool shooting features. Toy camera, Poster effect etcCons- On Amazon its states that the camera can 'optically zoom while shooting video'. Not true. Its digital zoom which was a HUGE disappointment for me. If you like zooming a lot, I wouldn't recommend this camera. If you like zooming in optically during video, check out the Elph 300 and Elph 500 HS.- NO autofocus during MOVIE mode. This was another HUGE disappointment for me. I do a lot of close up shots during video and I can't do that. I called Canon and asked them if the camera autofocus's and they said yes it does. They told me to reset the camera and I did and still no autofocusing. I honestly think the camera doesn't autofocus at all during video. You can set it to macro mode, but I personally like autofocusing better. If you like autofocusing during video, check out the Elph 300 and Elph 500 HSConclusionI do like this camera a lot. It takes great still images and has some cool features. BUT I REALLY REALLY like zooming in optically and having autofocus during video. So I think I may return it to the store and buy the other Elph 300 HS or some other camera. I don't know :(. If you don't mind not having autofocusing during video and have digital zoom during video then this camera is just for you.""
"20120411","4.0","A decent camera","Bought this for my girlfriend as a backup. She has a Canon T2i, but having to always lug around a DSLR cameral is a drag.She loves having this for just going out and snapping photos for day to day types of things.The camera is pretty quick to turn on and be ready to shoot.The battery life seems to also be very satisfactory.The optical zoom is a nice feature, and works well. Digital zoom is useless and is just a marketing gimmick for all manufacturers.If you would like to manually set up shots, this camera allows you to do so to some extent, but I think the nice thing about this is its ability to be set on 'auto' and take decent shots.Pretty durable. I think she's dropped this a few times, and it still works fine.All in all, it's a decent camera for an ok price. My girlfriend swears by Canon and refuses to go elsewhere, otherwise, I probably could have found something just as good from another brand for a better price.""
"20120410","4.0","Love this camera BUT...","Let me just say that for the price, it has a LOT of very awesome features such as filters and allows you to record short HD videos (depending on the SD card you buy). On the creative side, I am by no means a professional photographer but I have yet to take a bad picture with this little guy. It has SO many different settings to play with that you do get inspired to take up photography as a fun and challenging hobby.On the technical side, I love the amply sized viewing screen, the user friendly layout, and what I really like is that it has a fast shutter (a problem that was the bane of my existence with previous digital cams since I love taking pics of fast moving objects as well as night time scenes). You can choose the file size of your pics & vid, has really good zoom for the price, and the battery life is also a big plus!The reason I give this a 4 instead of 5 is that the video quality leaves much to be desired. It will take really good vids at subjects that are close but it has given me inconsistent results when recording objects that are at a distance. Sometimes, it will record pretty decent, exceptionally well on rare occasions, and most of the time, distant subjects appear blurry and the cam won't auto focus on them.I have owned this camera for about 2 and a half months now. Overall, I would recommend this cam for anyone wanting to take really good digital pics no matter what style (close up, panoramic, portrait, night time, action, etc) and who doesn't need to sell a kidney just to have a really good camera.

"20120409","4.0","Fantastic--thank you smartphones...","...for bringing down the prices of these gems.  I'm embarrassed that I've tried to substitute with smartphone cams for the past two years. I can't believe how advanced this camera is.Amazing clarity, speed, processing power, and smarts. We upgraded from a dutiful and still-working ELPH 700.  If memory serves, several years ago I payed almost twice as much for about half the camera (resolution, quality, lens). I made the leap for the video and the amazing price.1080p HD video looks fantastic.  Great compression, a little noisy with fast pans and 'busy' scenes (windy trees, water, etc).  But for a camera that can stay in your pocket, it looks great.Still photos, because of Canon's new HS software, come out with a huge dynamic range, lots of good gradients and blending, and quiet, clear lines in high-contrast shots.On image lock and shooting times from other reviewers: this camera wants you to be happy. It will not blindly fire away in Auto mode without having some time to think. If you want instant response, head over to the functions menu and use sports, night, kids, etc.  Otherwise give it the .5-1.5 seconds it needs.  TIP: in auto, once it does decide on the image type--keep firing the button and you can get several shots quickly (1-2 per second if no flash and you have a quick finger).My only star drop, and this is important if you value video: this lens config DOES NOT ALLOW ZOOM IN RECORDING VIDEO MODE. In other words, whatever lens length was when you hit the red button is what you're stuck with during the shot. It does allow digital zoom in, but that's just active image cropping and looks bad in the end product.Therefore, I am upgrading to the 300HS to support that feature.  Worth it for me.Past that, everything on this camera--especially if you've shot ELPH before--works great.""

"20120318","5.0","Love this camera!","Prior to buying the Canon ELPH 100HS camera, I returned a Nikon S3100 to Costco due to consistently blurry pictures.  That was an 'impulse buy' based on a great price.  After checking the reviews at Amazon, I could see why the price was so low.  There were lots of poor reviews on that particular camera for the same reason.  This camera is going to Europe with my daughter in a few months, so what good are 14M pixels if the pictures are not focused properly?I researched other point-and-shoot cameras on Amazon, and came up with the Canon ELPH 100HS as my next target. This time I carefully read the reviews and downloaded the owner's manual ahead of the purchase.  Yes, I paid a little more, but it was worth every penny.  The picture quality is so much better!  The images are consistently clear and well-focused.  The HS (high sensitivity) feature produces great shots at low light levels as well.  Some of the low light shots are even better than those of my own Canon S5 IS camera, although the S5 uses older technology.  I am thoroughly impressed with this model!  It even scrolls helpful hints at the bottom of the display, in case you can't remember what certain settings are used for.  You can turn off the hints if you prefer.  Read the owner's manual from the Canon website and you'll see the complete feature list.The 1080p full HD video is amazing as well.  I played back a video on my Vizio LCD TV using a mini HDMI cable (purchased separately) from the camera, and I was impressed.  The video was as detailed and smooth as any HD video that I've seen from a camcorder.  I used a class 10 32GB card, so that my daughter can capture over 5000 pictures or 1 hour of HD video when she tours Europe.  At least I know her pictures and videos will be great!""

I also own a Canon Rebel T2i. While the 100 HS gives the Rebel a run for its money, there is a distinct difference in performance between the two. The much more expensive Rebel is a better camera. However, it is significantly bigger and thus more to carry. When traveling, and not wanting to be branded as a tourist, the 100 HS is quite satisfactory. The smaller camera is also less likely to attract thieves. I suppose the 100 HS can take pictures suitable for publication; if managed carefully. I've used it for about three months with no problems. The last two weeks have been heavy use - over a thousand pictures. I've been downloading to a Mac Air and have found that the quality is reasonably close to a Rebel a friend was using. I also downloaded the Rebel's shots, many were of almost the same angle and subject - it was hard to tell the difference (a more skilled photographer than I would likely see the difference). To sum up my impressions: I'd buy this camera again, its performance has been quite satisfactory and I am willing to recommend it to my sensible friends.""

"20120311","5.0","Great Value for a CMOS Imager ELPH","I've had this camera for about 4 month now. I really like - image quality is great for what I'm shooting, it's smaller than the previous cameras (other ELPHs, Samsung, and Nikons), and has an excellent price point. The viewscreen is large enough and brieght enough for using it in direct sunlight. I also bought the Canon underwater housing for this camera and have been very impressed with the underwater images and videos it took. if I lost this camera today, i would immediately buy another identical camera to replace it. I'm that happy with it.""

"20120310","1.0","Worst Customer Service, Common Problem Unacknowledged By Canon, $126.95 In Warranty Repair Cost! Outrageous","We had this camera for a little over 1 month when the zoom mechanism got stuck half open.  We googled the problem to find that it is a flaw well know by users of Canon Powershot cameras and is not acknowledged by Canon as a flaw in camera design.The exact problem that occurs triggers the the Canon E18 error which happens when the lens gets stuck while trying to extend. The camera will beep a few times and the LCD will display a little E18 in the lower-left corner. The lens gets stuck in the extended position, and refuses to move either to focus the lens or to retract when powered off. It's annoying as heck.  But what's more annoying is that Canon takes FOREVER to respond and when they do, they tell you that you must have dropped the camera and so they will not cover it under warranty.  Which, in this case, is categorically untrue.The repair is $126.95 ... $21 more than what we spent on the camera in the first place.  In warranty standard labor charge of $115 and $11 2 day shipping charge.  Absurd.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAMERA UNTIL THEY FIX THE PROBLEM. We'll be going with the Panasonic Lumix from now on ... Panasonic has incredible customer service and great cameras!! Canon lost a loyal customer. [...]""
"20120310","3.0","Soft and noisy - but I like the features","I'm going to keep this camera because one has to take into consideration the ease of use and the price.  My other camera is a Sony TX1 - also a subcompact, but twice the price.  Nonetheless, I would have expected the Canon to have better images than the Sony because (1) the Sony uses folded optics and (2) the Canon is 12 megapixels vs. 10 on the Sony and (3) the Elph 100 is newer technology.To my surprise, in side-by-side comparison, the images from the TX1 were less noisy, and more detailed.Keep in mind, you would only notice this if you greatly enlarged the photos. Otherwise, colors, exposures, response time, etc. were all very good on the Canon.""

"20120306","4.0","A really useful, fun camera","This camera is packed with great features and special effects. As someone who used to use film cameras, I'm still amazed by how much processing a little pocket camera like this has built in. Things like slow-motion video and diorama effects are very fun to play with.Images seem a little less punchy than from my old PowerShot A510. I think it's mainly because the ELPH 100's colors are less saturated. You can increase the color saturation in the menu settings, but the more neutral colors are more flattering in portraits.Low light performance is quite good, which is important because existing-light photos look so much more natural than flash photos. I got impressive shots in a very dimly lit restaurant by using Low Light mode and letting the camera handle the automatic white balance.The body is smooth, so it's easy to pocket. It's a bit slippery, though, so use the included wrist strap.""
"20120305","4.0","duh--camera review","This is a nice camera, but I won't give it five stars because, just like the other Canon we had, it leans to too-dark pics at times. According to the reviews I had read, it didn't do that. And I'm sure we don't 'take' pics any differently than other inexpensive-Canon owners.""
"20120305","5.0","Significant improvements","I bought an ELPH five years ago.  It was a good camera and lasted a long time. Unfortunately it got stolen on a recent trip.  No big deal.  It was time to get a new one.The improvements in the ELPH are dramatic.  Picture quality is amazing and now you can shoot HD video (which looks great).Read the manual.  This camera is much smarter.  It has various features to improve your picture quality as well as achieve pro type shots.  It won't replace a high end SLR but it is amazing what you can do with this little camera.One of its features is that if you want to take a picture with yourself in it, it will detect when there is a new face in the shot and then take a picture. Mad!It allows you to focus on objects and then keep those objects in focus even if you move the camera to recompose the shot.It's just amazing.I love the interace. Canon has always made sense to me.Its crazy what you get for the price.  I wouldn't hesitate.""

I bought the pink one at Sammy's Camera for $109, cuz they were having a sale, or else I would've bought it on Amazon.I can't reiterate how amazing this camera is! The quality of the pics are priceless. The camera was VERY easy to use and the big screen was a HUGE plus. I've never been more happy with a Canon camera, and this is my fifth one! I havn't had good luck with cameras, but hoping this one will stick around for awhile.If you have any doubts or questions about which camera to get, this one WON'T disappoint you!!!!

"20120226","1.0","Dead after 2 month","I have been the owner of Canon Elph cameras for the last 5 or 6 years and can testify that the quality has gone down to the unacceptible level now.I have bought Elph 100 HS (Made in Japan, by the way) for this Christmas. After 2 months of VERY light use, the lenses would not retract or zoom anymore. The camera is dead. The camera is crap. Wished I could recommend a better point-and-shoot, but I can't.

I did NOT like try to predict which setting would make people look normal instead super super white. But this camera takes great pictures and finds the PERFECT setting for you.

I've red many reviews to learn a couple of issues: un-reliablily of made in China Camera, Design issue of made in Japan camera and run out of power of GPS units. After reading these, I thought there is no perfect camera why I bother pay a lot of money, so I decided Canon Powershot 100. The camera is working so far, but I wanted to mention a couple of issues.  Indoor, the many pictures looked yellowish. Also, video is not smooth.  I did not have any high hopes for this camera,so I'm ok with it.

There's also a fun 'vintage camera feature' on this one that the older version didn't have which does the vignetting around the outside edges and fisheye as well as others that's fun to play with.Like the earlier version, this one takes great photos that are easy to remove from the card, especially if you have one of those card reader slots on your computer.""

I thought it was a rare case but ended up with a faulty product myself. I was not happy because I was traveling 2 days later and this was a gift. However, I ordered Canon PowerShot ELPH 300HS immediately and received it just in time.My advice is to order this camera in advance and be prepared to return it in case you encounter a faulty piece or just go for ELPH 300HS.""

The auto feature is pretty decent on this camera and will take good photos. The screen is huge and takes up most of the back face. I love the cheery bright orange color. Overall it is a good buy. The one thing I would fix is that there's a delay between taking photos, which could be due to my memory card. Though the photos aren't amazing, they are solid for what it is.""

"20120202","3.0","Fine Camera, but Canon 300 HS is much better for video","I was looking for a camera to replace my Canon SD780 IS, which was a nearly perfect travel and main video camera until the day it stopped focusing.  Based on the reviews it looked like the Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS would be the perfect replacement.The body of the 100 HS is plastic, which made it feel inferior to the SD780, but the pictures it took looked great.  To me the real shortcoming was with its video. In HD it can only shoot at 24fps and quick movements produced a trippy distortion (not sure if it was a lens issue or an fps issue) that did not look as natural as my old SD780, which shot HD at 30fps.I've since bought a 300 HS for about $50 more and could not be happier with it, as it has a metal body, can shoot HD video at 30fps, can focus/ optically zoom during a video shoot and does not have the same distortion issue when shooting HD video as the 100 HS has.""

"20120129","2.0","Video Deficiencies","Still photos seem good, but all I've beena ble to download from videos is .mov files.  I can't figure out how to configure the camera to take .avi files.  I know I can convert .mov to .avi, but I believe every conversion costs in quality.  I have a library of .avi files I use for video editing.  The .mov video clips from the Canon 100 HS do not work with my .avi library without conversion.  All my previous digital cameras have been Canons and have taken .avi video clips.  Had I known of the new Canon standard or Canon ELPH 100 HS limitation of only taking .mov video clips, I would not have bought it.  OK for still snapshots.  Not usable for me for video clips.  I'll buy another camera and give or throw this one away.  My next digital camera will not be a Canon.""
"20120126","2.0","Disappointed","I use my point and shoot a lot and generally replace every 2 years. I decided to go a little lower end this time and get the ELPH 100 HS. I don't use all of the bells and whistles and decided to try to save some money.I read the reviews and many people mentioned the strap. I didn't think it would be a big deal, but not I understand. I have no idea how I could ever get it connected and it's very stiff. I'd switch the one from my old camera if I was keeping the 100 HS. The circle toggle button is so flat, it's hard to push. I have tiny hands and it's awkward and the final staw... no panaoramic! Ouch. Why didn't I think of that before I ordered? I shoot EVERYTHING in panoramic. Love it and can't live without it. Which is ok, because I could live with that toggle button! This will be my 5th digital, 4th Canon. I like them, I know them, and they are simple to use. I found the menus much more difficult to find what use to be easy.""

It boots up super quickly, pictures are perfect every time (though sometimes I notice a little blur if I don't do the half-push, then full push on the shutter button).  I even took video with this camera and was blown away by the quality.  I totally am ditching my DV camcorder in favor of using only this for the future.  Gorgeous color to the video.
