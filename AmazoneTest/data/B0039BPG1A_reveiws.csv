"20120531","2.0","Very small even for the Sony Alpha","It's not true that the Sony Alpha fits on this bag. I don't know for what kind of bags was meant, but my Sony Alpha doesn't fit at all. Even by pushing. You don't want to take off each time the objective from the camera only because you want to do one shoot. Considering than later you have to clean the objectives each time. Read carefully product's dimensions prior buying!""
"20120530","2.0","Don't waste your money!","A month after I purchased this camera from Amazon,  Best Buy sold it for 25.00 less than what I paid and it included the memory card and the case which I had to purchase seperately.  I am SO disappointed with the performance of this camera's zoom lens.  Outdoors photos are okay but not great.  Indoors are terrible!  I tried to take pictures at a kindergarten graduation and took some of the worst photos I've ever taken in my life!  I was only 25 feet from the stage and no matter what setting I used (and I tried then ALL)the photos were blurry and too dark.  I am not a novice.  I own four other cameras and my kids call me MAMARATZI.  I've even been the photographer at a couple of weddings.  I used my Sony for the weddings and the pictures were great. I just expected so much more for the money I paid for this camera.  If you are going to spend almost 400.00 on a new camera don't buy this one!  I should have put another 300.00 into it and bought a Nikon DSLR.""
"20120529","5.0","Perfect for My Kodak EasyShare Max Z990","Amazon is amazing.  Ordered this on Sunday and even though Monday was a holiday I received it this morning (Tuesday).  My Kodak EasyShare Max Z990 fits into this case perfectly with space for the neckstrap.  It is a very good-looking glossy little black case and the carry strap, when extended to it's full length fits my body cross-body style.  I am not a small woman, so this is great.  There is a small hidden-zippered compartment in the top of the lid on the inside maybe for keys or something.  There is an orange insert inside the body of the case that is attached with elastic.  Perhaps it is to place a sleeve of batteries?  Or you could put a small wallet back there.  Of course on the sides there are zip pockets for more batteries or memory cards.  You are not going to use this for personal items, but if you want a bag that fits this type of camera perfectly, this is it.  It is not difficult to pull the camera out and place back in, either and there's no way the lens cap will be falling off.  Just a note:  I placed the entire camera case with camera inside into my pacsafe metro 250 gi and it fit very nicely, did not make the pacsafe bag bulge, etc.  I'm thinking of using this for my upcoming trip to italy.  Just put the camera case into the larger bag while on metro, etc, then pull it out once i get to my destination.""
"20120528","4.0","Great Camera Bag","I purchased this camera bag for my new super zoom camera.  The construction seems good, and the protection seems adequate.  The bag is a bit smaller than ideal, but I am keeping this bag.""
"20120526","5.0","Great case for the price!","I've read some of the negative comments about it being too small.  I was able to get my Nikon P510 w/ strap, tv cables, charger w/usb cord, Jobyo tripod, 4 batteries, lens cloth and extra SD card in it.  What else do you need?  Granted there is no wasted space but I have everything I need in one compact, easy to carry case.  Definitely worth the money.  The camera is a tight fit, as mentioned by some - but it is a carrying bag.  How many times do you take a picture, put it up and pull it out for another picture?  You don't... you only put it in the case when you are through with it, so what is the big deal?  I highly recommend this case if you want a light weight, compact bag that will hold everything you need.""
"20111228","5.0","This Camera Bag is Great!","I purchased this as a Christmas gift for someone who had already received a camera.  It was exactly the size it was described to be, so it was a perfect fit.  The outside is tough material and the inside is soft enough not to scratch camera lenses if the covers come off. The zippers slide smoothly and really can't beat this item for the price. The only part I would worry about would be the snap clip for the carrying strap, I would like it to be metal, but I haven't received a metal snap clip on anything since the early 90's so I wouldn't expect one.  Overall I give it 5 stars.  -carmex""

Its not a DSL, smaller than that but bigger than the normal point and shoot cameras, with a nice zoom capability.  The camera fits snuggly in the bag, a little room to spare for an extra battery, and memory card.  But not room for the charger.  I didnt want to get a bulky camera bag and this one is just the right size for protecting the camera.  It looks good and has a decent amount of padding.  It is taller than it is longer which makes it perfect to place the camera in it with the left side of the camera down and the right side where you hold the camera up, so its easy to get out.""

"20111215","5.0","Very good camera case","This case is really everything you'd ever want to protect and carry your camera. I recently purchased a Nikon Coolpix P500 (which is a great camera for the record) and as you know it's not a DSLR, but it sure looks like one, so I needed a case that is larger than the typical point-and-shoot case, but I didn't want a huge one. This one is perfect. It fits the camera perfectly. Then there are multiple other zipper pockets to hold batteries, memory cards, etc and a partition within the main chamber to carry some cords (if necessary). It suits me very well, but I will say that if you are looking for a case that will carry everything that goes with the camera then this one isn't for you. The camera takes up pretty much all of the main chamber and I was only able to fit one cord next to it. If you are planning on carrying the camera a long with a bunch of accessories then I definitely recommend going for a larger case.""

"20111122","5.0","Great bag for the Fujifilm HS20 and for other Superzooms","I purchased the Case Logic DCB-304 bag since it was recommended for my Fujifilm HS20 camera. The bag itself is attractive and light weight, and is made with quality materials and workmanship.  The detachable strap can be lengthened for a comfortable fit around your neck or over a shoulder.  The bag itself could use a bit more padding at the bottom to better protect the camera from bumps, but additional padding could be placed inside if this is of concern to you.Initially, I was concerned about the compact size of the bag and whether it would hold the camera and a few essential accessories.  To my surprise, the camera fit well in the main compartment, even with the lens hood and camera strap installed.  The side compartments are larger than they appear, with one side holding spare batteries, and the USB and video cables in the other side.  There is enough room remaining to include a few filters or other small items.  Inside the top cover is a small zippered compartment which is the perfect size to hold a couple extra SD cards.Overall I am very happy with the bag and recommend it for superzoom cameras due to its size and flexibility.""

"20111027","4.0","Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX100V fits nicely","Not much to add to other reviews except to let anyone looking for a case for the Sony HX100V know that the camera fits well. When I was looking, I couldn't find input about the fit for this camera. I took a chance on it despite the fact that the Case Logic website indicates that it would be too small for the camera, and found that it houses the camera very comfortably without a lot of wiggle.The camera fits with the grip facing up and the lens to the side. There is ample additional space in the interior compartment for an extra battery, SD card, even charging and USB cables. Two exterior side pockets can stash more goodies. The materials and build of the camera are very high quality and provide plenty of protection against scratches and minor dings, and decent protection against more extreme injury.One caveat here is size. If you are looking for a bag that holds all this stuff, you will not find one that is much more compact than this one. The Case Logic bags recommended for the HX100V were much larger than I want, which is why I crossed my fingers and ordered this one. If you are not interested in carrying everything with you in the bag, and just want something that simply protects your camera from scratches and does not take up too much space in your backpack, you might want to go with a neoprene case that hugs the camera and protects from scratches without adding bulk. Personally I would have preferred something in between, with more to it than the neoprene but less space-consuming than even this pack. Overall, however, it is a very fine case backed by a confidence-building 25 year warranty from Case Logic.""

It is a nice camera bag, but although it is titled for a high/fixed zoom camera, it really isn't large enough to easily accommodate a zoom lense camera and I'm not talking DSLR with detached lenses and things, we have a high zoom Sony camera. It took me a few tries to find a way to put the camera in the bag so I could get it out easily, and in doing so am unable to put something in one of the side pockets. My husband became very irritated with it because of the difficulty in taking the camera in and out.If the center opening were just a little larger it could accommodate everything with ease.

I have a Canon T1i, and it fits the camera with the stock lens (EF-S 18-55mm IS) attached, even when the lens hood is attached and turned right side out. However, it doesn't fit my zoom lens (EF 75-300mm) very well. I can jam it in after removing the hood if I try, but I don't like to do that. It's fine for me, because right now I mostly use the 18-55mm lens, and I don't plan on buying another zoom anytime soon, so the rest of my lenses should fit.The side pockets are very useful, and I usually have a filter or two in there, as well as an extra battery and an extra SD card. It fits all this easily and could fit one or two small items more. The bag is lightweight, making it easy to carry the camera around all day.

"20110809","5.0","Wonderful Carry bag","I use this bag to carry my little Kodak easyshare and Flip cameraI keep the USB cord for the Kodak with its wall charger in the same pocket and my cell phone in the small inside pocket.the strap that is used to carry the bag on the shoulder or over the body is a somewhat short.I think the strap is only like 3.5 feet when it is made to its longest length.I like the two zipper pockets on the outside of the side of the bag that glide easily.Wonderfully made. It seems to be made of a durable product""
"20110808","3.0","Dimensions not correct","This bag is nice but it does not conform to the given size.  My zoom point and shoot should have fit, but evidently the bag size is external dimensions and not internal dimensions available for the camera.  By the time you take in the padding, and internal pouches, my super zoom point and shoot fits so tightly and only lens down that I am afraid that the camera would be damaged with this case.  Case Logic needs to give correct internal dimensions especially for online sales.""
"20110808","4.0","Case Too Small for Camera...!","I bought the case and it's nice but more suited for a little smaller camera than the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX100 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera.  So I am still searching for the perfect case fro my camera.""
"20110808","3.0","Tight Fit","The case was high quality material and well made. Unfortunately it is quite a tight fit. I took one of the other reviewer's advice and also purchased a handstrap to help pull the camera out of the case. The strap actually exacerbate the situation, and I could barely zip it closed.""
"20110807","1.0","Not a choice for Canon PowerShot SX 20IS and SX 30IS","I just checked this camera case in a local Case Logic dealer. My Canon PowerShot SX 30IS fitted well in it, but...Even when the case overall quality is good, however be warned this piece is TOO SMALL for carrying all of your Canon PowerShot SX20 IS or SX 30IS accesories.It has two mid-sized side pockets, with room enough for extra battery and charger... But, keep in mind that if you want to carry the additional lens hood, lens filter adapter, any lens cleaner device you use, and (very important) an additional Canon compact Speedlite Flash Set (like the 270EX or 270 EX II), you simply WON'T HAVE ROOM ENOUGH for the whole set!!!""
"20110806","5.0","Perfect for my needs","I bought one of those super zoom cameras, the Sony HX100V, and needed a case for it. The case had to be big enough to get some accessories in it, but not too large and heavy. I have a bad back, and cannot deal with some of those cases where you can contain the 'kitchen sink'.The Case Logic DCB-304 is just about perfect for me. It holds the camera, extra memory, an extra batteries, a travel charger and the u.s.b. cable. I also can fit in the small booklet that came with the camera. It is not large enough for a soft cover camera book, or the large charger that came with the camera, but that is a minor problem. The case has both a handle, and a shoulder strap.If you are looking for a compact case that will allow you to take all the 'necesseries', this Case Logic will do very nicely....................and the price is right!""

"20110730","5.0","Perfect for my Sony DSC-HX100v","One previous reviewer didn't think it fit the camera well, but it fits it perfectly without being tight or jiggly, and with room for my extra batteries and memory.  The original power cable with a transformer brick would not fit well in this bag, but my small third party battery charger with wall fold-out prongs and a car adapter fits fine, as well as a usb cable(made unnecessary by an eye-fi card), cleaning cloth, etc.  It will not fit any but the tiniest tripod or extendable monopod along with my camera.  This isn't a carry all, but is a better solution in my opinion than the sony form fitting cover both for sealing better and for price.""
"20110726","4.0","Good Case for Camera","The case is a good size and weight. Durable material with 2 side pockets. Camera fits securly in the case both vertically and horizontally.""
"20110726","5.0","Got for Sony HX100V","Picked up this bag for a Sony HX100V camera. This review will be tailored to those with such a camera or one of samesize.I wanted a bag that was as small and light as possible for portable and safe transport of the camera itselfand a few must have accessories when out and about. For that purpose it is a perfect fit with one caveat.  The camera itself fits snugly and there is room in the top overlap panel for 2 batteries and extra memory cards. One could probably get 3 batteries in there perhaps 4 if they were determined. Inside the case if you place the with the Sony HX100v in place there is some spare room for small articles in the front inside sleeve and along side of the camera. On the outside zipper compartments there is sufficient room for the USB cable and minor errata in one zipper compartmentand in the other I placed a battery charger I purchased (not the one that ships with the camera) that works with 115VAC. The charger has flip out AC prongs and is somewhat compact. There is also room for the 12VDC cigarrete adapter that will work with that charger as well.There would also be room for filters, if one has modified the camera to accept such. Just enough room for some minor paperwork after that and a cleaning cloth. Bottom line a snug fit but not too snug and a small light case to carry around for when you want a camera in a case.The carry strap has clip hooks that seem solid and can be removed if desired. The strap is plenty adjustable, for a six footer like me I had to lengthen the strap almost all the way to carry comfortable about the near hip area.No fancy wide padded strap but the bag and camera are so light I don't expect that to be much of a issue. If it is, one can buy well padded carry straps. There is a belt loop on the back that is beefy and well stitched and wide enough for 4 adult male fingers to fit.Downside is it is not Velcro (TM) removable so if that is a issue you would look elsewhere OR you could modify this one with some creative work to make it a Velcro adjustable belt loop.  If you really have to lug around extra accessories it is a easy matter to get some lens like bags to just hang off (with Velcro TM straps) the above camera bag strap. I did that with the battery charger that shipped with the HX100v.  Heck, the bag is small enough if you had to you could get a rather large camera bag, stash this bag and your errataaccessories in it.  Course that would be nuts. Would the camera survive a drop to concrete inside this bag? Perhaps if only a drop of 3 feet or less but that is justa guess, I surely am not testing that. The bag is somewhat padded but not to a great degree.  Best not drop it though.The caveat: THe charger that ships with this camera is a large brick with a bulky cable set and there really isn't room in the case for it, nor if you try to shove it in one of the side zipper pockets. That is a additional reason to get a separate charger for this camera. I suppose one could really try hard to make the charger to fit in the case but that makes it rather difficult to remove the camera quickly and with little fuss. I opted to either leave it at home or if on a long trip will carry it in a separate bag that I attach to this bag's strap. The price I paid here at Amazon was cheaper by a few bucks at least than what Wally World wanted for one. Good deal.""
"20110726","5.0","Great size For the Nikon L120!","Great size for the Nikon L120! Small & lightweight. Has plenty of room for Camera w/strap, memory cards, extra batteries(inside lid flap), etc...Plus it can still hold a small wallet on the other side of the inside divider or under the camera, and a small flip phone in one of the outside pockets. Still has room to spare. Wouldn't go bigger for that camera. Glad it can double for my purse when out and about. Can use with or w/o the strap, since has it has a top handle and a loop in back for a belt. Love the small compact size with all the pockets. Not heavy at all.""
"20110726","5.0","Does the job","I bought this case to fit a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35.  The camera fit perfectly in this case and also has sufficient run to hold a battery charger and an extra SD card. It is rather compact and that is what I was looking for.  If you need to carry additional accessories you might want to consider a little larger case.""

This bag was a great choice.  Everything I need for the camera fits nicely (battery charger, USB cable, extra flash cards & battery) and I can even carry the bag on my belt (hands free) thanks to the incorporated belt loop.  The construction of the bag is even better than I expected given what I paid for it.  If you're on the fence trying to decide about ordering one of these bags, do yourself a favor and just do it, you'll be happy you did.""
"20110718","5.0","Canon SX-I30 fits perfectly","We just recently bought a Canon SX-I30 digital camera, and it fits perfectly in this case.  You have to turn it sideways to fit in in, but the strap goes in just fine, as well.  It has plenty of padding, and a strap that is long enough to comfortably hang it from your shoulder.  Great price, too.""
"20110717","3.0","too small","I thought the number of positive reviews on this bag was very misleading. While it fits a large digital camera nicely(I have the sony cybershot hx100), that is about all it fits. I guess if you want a bag that is light and you don't want to be able to fit anything else into it than it is a good bag. I have no problems with the construction; it is fine. I personally want to be able to fit in my charger, etc. when I carry my camera around. I have cords hanging out the sides because I can't zip them all the way up. This is really frustrating. My charger and usb cords aren't very large either. Probably going to buy another bag.""
"20110709","5.0","JUST the right size","A half an inch in any dimension would have been too small. It fits my Nikon P500 PERFECTLY! There is JUST enough room for my NEEDED carry alongs. You know Batteries, SD cards, Charger. I have to give it a 5star because every thing fits and perfectly! Though if any smaller at all it would have been too small. So If all you want to cary in it are those things I mentioned it is PERFECTLY FINE!!! Quality is very good. It will last a long time! Happy with purchase and recommend!""
"20110706","5.0","Very well made.","For the price I never expected to get such a well made case.  It is roomy enough for all of my 'extras' also.

"20110705","3.0","For sony dsc-hx100v","Great camera Case for the price. Was reccomended for the newer class of super zoom cameras. Good case for the money with lots of compartments and pockets. Only negative is the Sony fits rather tightly and does not allow room to carry charging cables for camera. If you are looking for an all around camera case for super zoom cameras this is a good one as long as you don't mind not being able to carry your charger or cables with you. For the price and portability I am going to keep it but only for the times i just want to take the camera along...

"20110701","2.0","Too small for SLR cameras","The bag is very small for my Nikon D3100 SLR and I decided to give it to one of my friends for his Sony cybershot. I don't recommend this for any SLR camera. You may need to put the camera upside down in the bag, which may damage the lens!""
"20110630","5.0","Perfect for camera protection","This case has the capacity to carry the camera, extra memory cards, batteries, USB cords, and TV cords. So convenient to have it 'all-in-one'. Very sturdy and has an adjustable strap. Protects the camera well.""
"20110629","2.0","On the small side","I purchased this bag in a pinch at Wallyworld for double the Amazon price in May 2011. I have a Panasonic DMC fz40. The camera and cleaning cloth were about all I could fit in comfortably.  The tulip hood or any additional lense all had to be forced in against the body of the camera which I wasn't comfortable doing.  If all you want to carry is the camera body... then this will work.  Anything else is a stretch.""
"20110629","5.0","The case I won't live without!","This camera case is the 'bomb.com!' It is small enough to attach to my much larger camera case, back-to-back. I was able to put the camera in the back pocket and my accessories in the front pocket. The two sides, I was able to put in my exta batteries, memory card, my wallet and my car keys. I've even figured out to take the straps off and hook the case to my belt for easy carrying while enjoying the sights. This is a case the airport won't make me check in as baggage. I truly love this case because I can carry my camera my EVERYWHERE I go. I LOVE THIS CASE!!!!""
"20110627","5.0","Smallest Possible Bag - Panasonic FZ-40","Which was what I was looking for: the smallest bag that had a belt loop that I could put my FZ-40 into and retrieve it w/o a lot of hassle - who wants to struggle when there's a picture to take? I don't carry my charger along - that stays in the suitcase - but it'd be a real squeeze to put the charger in the bag with batteries, RAM cards, filters, harness, etc.This Case Logic bag is absolutely amazing for the $$'s. I gave just under $12 including s/h. It was much the cheapest bag under consideration and I looked at a lot of 'em.  The FZ-40 fits most easily  by dropping it end first into the bag, not lens up/forward but pointing to either side of the bag.The zipper pulls have nice big, orange lined, rubberized grabbers which is important. I kind of wished the bag opened and closed with a Velcro fastener or a snap or something other than zippers. Still, the way the bag opens narrowly from the top makes it pretty easy and secure to walk along with the bag unzipped - camera is very secure this way. Nice little handle on the top to carry your equipment about when it's not strapped to your belt or hanging off your shoulder.The fastenings, zippers and materials in general are good but this is not a Porsche! The design is very nice: two side pockets for batteries, filters, small whatnots, a small zipper pocket is just the right size for RAM cards. Haven't figured out what to do with the slip-in pocket in front of the camera compartment: be just about right for a thin-ish manual if Panasonic weren't so darned cheap. Suppose you could put the idiotically simple minded startup manual there...I'm baffled by the comment about the straps being to thin to protect against a robbery? Don't carry it on your shoulder if you don't want it stolen, regardless of the straps, dude.It's 4.5*'s overall and 5*'s considering the price.""

Then we opened it up and put the camera in, lens first, it fit really snug, which I think is good because you don't really want it moving around too much. It's nicely padded. For our daily use, not being rough with the bag, it provides adequate protection for the camera. The pocket inside and the ones on the sides are good for holding extra batteries, cables and the camera's charger. Over all, it fits my husbands needs so he's quite happy with it!""

"20120518","4.0","Too tight for Fuji HS 30/20 etc.","The Fujifilm HS30 EXR (and HS20 EXR) accept 58mm lense filters. The side pockets on the Case Logic DCB-304 are too small to cary a bunch of filters. The camera fits so tight that I can barely get my fingers in to remove the camera from the case(I fear I will accidently push a button or smudge the screen). For this camera a better case would be a Case Logic TBC-306. The camera fits perfectly. The case has more padding and the pockets are large enough to hold a few filters, spare memory cards, spare battery, cords, and lense cleaning equipment. Another case that fits better is the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10. It is the smalest case I have found that will fit this camera (inexpensive too). The Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 has only one pocket. If you travel light and don't cary all the stuff I do, I consider it to be an excelent choice. It has a clasp to hold the cover down (rather than noisy velcro). All of these cases have a few things in common. They all have a belt loop and open from the top. I like to wear the case on my hip, like a holster. The distance the case protrudes from my hip is critical (it is easy to wack it on things you are walking past). All of these cases have minimal bulk. I had a Tamrac case. It held my Fuji HS20 EXR and my stuff. I liked that the top covered the whole bag and was held down using a clasp (like the lowepro above). But, all of the storage space was on the front of the bag, making it very bulky and cumbersome when carying it on my hip. I prefer the side pockets on the Case Logic TBC-306... Just wish it had a clasp instead of velcro.""
"20120516","4.0","quality product, but...","I agree that case logic makes quality camera bags.  I have several already and so purchased this one without hesitation.  It is a high quality case at a good price.  However, my Nikon Coolpix P510 just barely fits in the case and there is not much room for the cables that came with the camera.  So, I would recommend case logic products but just make sure that if you have a bigger camera, you get a bigger case.""

It's big enough to carry the camera and spare SD cards, spare battery or charger in the side pockets but still small enough to not be annoying to carry.  During out trip to the amusement park this past weekend it worked great.  I had no problem carrying it around all day.  I had the camera in the bag with my phone in one pocket and my wallet in the other.  Granted it's a small wallet, no Costanza wallet is going to fit.

"20110515","5.0","Perfect case for the CoolPix P500","I am an advanced amateur photographer who has been using SLR's for 40 years.  I use a Nikon D90 for serious photography, but I bought the Nikon CoolPix P500 because I wanted to have a quality camera handy that is not a chore to bring along making you sorry you brought it. I am going on vacation to the Bahamas and I wanted a day bag for the camera.  This case has ample room for the P500 and the strap in the main compartment.  The side pockets are ample for extra memory cards and batteries.  You can also fit the Nikon rapid charger and a few pre-moistened lens wipes, but not much else.  Perfect. It is compact enough that it does not get in the way and has a belt loop so you can attach it to your side or back to keep it from swinging all over the place when climbing, hiking or biking.  It is well padded and should protect the camera well from bumps and bruises as well as light rain.  This bag provides ample protection without the bulk of a bigger bag.  VERY SATISFIED.""

"20110511","4.0","A snug fit","This case was exactly what I was looking for -- small. It may be a little too small. My camera(Canon SX30IS) didn't fit at all lens forward and while it did fit lens down, the strap didn't have room to squish in without pushing the power buttons on. Also, the fit was so tight side to side the only way to remove the camera was to pull the strap which would then pull the lens forward causing the camera to get stuck or pull off the lens cap. If you don't use a strap and put some foam in the bottom of the case it may work fine. I finally found that turning the camera sideways worked great. It takes a little effort to tuck the strap out of the way of the power buttons but I have the hand grip facing upwards ready to grab for fast shooting action. You can't carry many accessories, but the small size and belt 'loop' makes this case great for hiking, rock-climbing, etc.""

I also purchased a Canon Deluxe Case PSC-4100 and that one is not so good. Case Logic bag out beats it for many reasons.  One being that I don't feel I'm going to kill the camera by taking it in and out of the bag. When you spend good dollars on a camera you want to feel it's  protected, which I do with this bag.  I love the little side compartments for camera accessories. The long strap is also a plus.  When I purchased my camera I was shown many bags, and I walked away that day without purchasing one feeling that there must be some better bag out there I can purchase. And there is,'THE CASE LOGIC BAG. I would recommend it. I'm not sure of other powershot cameras fitting but mine does perfectly.""
"20110427","5.0","Exactly what I needed","I wanted to be able to carry a camera with me everywhere I go, so I bought a little Leica D-lux. The problem is that all of the cases supposedly designed for these cameras are too small. I needed something a little larger. This camera case is exactly the right size for my needs. It is small enough not to be difficult to handle, while it is big enough for my little Leica and a similarly small Canon HF R21 video camera with room in outside pockets for accessories.Wear it on your belt? It has a sturdy belt loop, and you can wear it on your belt (or on a second belt like a holster or fanny pack) without it weighing you down. Although it also has an excellent strap, I always planned to use the belt loop, and that works just fine.I would do cons, but I don't see any cons. It is precisely what I hoped it would be -- so you only get pros.- very light and soft but sufficiently rigid and strong.- about 1/4th inch padding throughout on the inside.- two outside pockets capable of carrying accessories such as chargers, batteries, filters, patch cords, and the like.- one inside pocket large enough for batteries or memory cards.- and a partitioned area large enough for a couple of manuals -- what I use it for.The case is not really designed for my camera. It is really designed for my wife's Canon SX-20IS. This would serve her just as well as it does me. Unfortunately, the case doesn't come in a different color, or I would get one for her -- too bad.If this is the right size for your needs, it is certainly the right quality for them.""

"20110407","4.0","Case Logic?","Case Logic? If you say say so. I have mixed feelings about this case. The construction seems top notch, plenty of padding, tough zippers that work well, overall a good buy. I purchased this for my Lumix FZ35, it's a good fit and it looks like it will keep this pricey little gem fairly safe. It's OK, but I've already got my eye out for a replacement.My review is specific to the camera that I purchased it for, but I think similar problems will exist with other cameras of similar size and shape.The problem with this Case, is the Logic, or lack thereof. Let me break it down for you. The only practical way to place a camera in the case is to place it on it's back with the lens facing up, this is the most efficient and works well. If I put it in some other way I would not be able to put in the lens visor that came with my camera (which I do by removing it and flipping it around backwards over the lens). If your camera is bigger than my FZ35 this is not the case for you.The back of the case has a sturdy belt strap which the designers apparently meant to be used seeing as the lid unzips away from the back of the case. Unzipping the lid reveals a small zipper pouch a bit larger than a credit card, not roomy enough for extra batteries but you could place a lens filter or maybe half a dozen memory cards in here with no problem, this is beneath the lid. There are also 2 exterior pockets, one on each side, it's a great concept but a poor design, this is my problem with the 'logic' of this case.Why would a company design pockets into a bag that could not be practically used? The pockets are sewn rounded up from the bottom of the bag, they are rounded. What this means is, if you should bother to put anything in them that would be considered standard fare in a photographic setup (battery charger, 2 extra batteries, usb data cable, extra filter, or the detachable shoulder strap should you use the belt strap feature) the pockets cannot contain the items without pressing them into the interior of the case. What this means is, if you put your camera in the case and fill the exterior pockets, you will have to empty said pockets to remove your camera or if you fill the pockets first you will not be able to place your camera in the case, very frustrating.I've somehow managed to get all the items I mentioned above into this case as well as the AV cable that came with my camera, it works for me since I use this while cross country backpacking and space is at a premium for me. But I find that most of the time, while my gear stays in the case and packed away in my ruck, the camera is bobbing along around my neck or nestled in my fanny pack. I like this case and yet I could have easily given it 3 stars for what I consider a major design flaw. In an attempt to be stylish, the designers have seriously impaired the funtionality of this item. I hope this was helpful. Shalom.""

I use the zippered pocket inside the camera compartment lid-flap to hold my many SD cards. The zippered outside pockets easily hold my 2 extra batteries and wall/car charger and cords. smooth zippers too. The case shoulder strap adjusts long enough to carry diagonally across torso.  I'm 5'11' and not skinny. It actually will hang low on the waistline when adjusted all the way out. There is a wide flush belt loop on the back too. I bought the a Zipshot tripod from Tamrac that straps perfect to the shoulder strap loops on the back using the tripods attached bungee straps. This is a great lite and compact rig.

"20101117","5.0","Case Logic camera case purchased for Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ40","I purchased the Case Logic DCB-304 High/Fixed Zoom Camera Case together with a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ40 digital camera based on Amazon's suggestion in the 'Frequently Purchased Together' section the web page.  The product met my expectations and I am satisfied with it.  In my opinion it is well constructed and has adequate padding to protect the camera from the knocks that sometimes accompany travel.I carry my camera in the case with the lens hood either in storage mode (i.e., reversed on the lens)or fastened to the lens in normal mode.  You need to know that the camera just fits in the case when the lens hood is attached in the normal position.  If you plan to carry the camera with a telephoto extension and adaptor attached together with the lens hood I don't think it will fit the case (I don't have these accessories so I am not absolutely sure about this).There are two side pockets in which I store the av, usb cables, battery charger and spare battery.  There is a zippered pocket in the inside of the top of the case where I carry my spare memory cards.I found this to be a very handy compact case that just fits the camera plus essential accessories and is convenient to carry and great for traveling especially where space is at a premium.  If you have need to carry more accessories or equipment then a larger case or camera bag will be necessary.""

The bag has enough room for my SLR camera, extra batteries, extra memory cards, USB cord, and any thing else that I might need to go along with my camera. However, the best thing about it is that it can fit everything I would need for my camera yet still is small enough to not be a hassle to carry around all day.....even while traveling....let's say like at a theme park or sight-seeing all day.  Having the choice of a handle or a wide adjustable shoulder strap makes it super easy to carry.  I also like the fact that it has some nice built-in cushion to keep my camera protected.

I do a lot of travelling so I would like to be able to carry pretty much everything for the camera in one bad (keeps from misplacing things).The camera I bought has the normal items with it....Ill go step by step in how they fit.Camera...tight but fits pretty good. Not a lot of padding so I would be freaked out if I dropped it in the bag.Charger...seems to fit fine in the side pocket, kind fo tight.Cords...seem to fit fine also, on top of the camera...kind of tight but able to zip.Manuals and software...this is a problem. They have a little inside pocket for them but its REAL tight. Im certain if resting the wrong way. the CD's can easily be damaged.Overall I can get everything in it. ITs extremely tight. So I would have ti figure something else out for an additional battery, sd card (its so tight I wouldnt want to ruin one), I would eventually like to upgrade the lense with 2-3x wide angle and filters. There definately will not be space for that.....nice little bag to take out ofr an afternoon. I wouldnt suggest travelling with it though.""

Two zippers would have allowed for easier, quick access to the camera (for pull-and-grab).This camera bag would be great if I wanted to travel very light and only bring the camera without the accessories (spare battery charger, hood, etc.) I do like the side zip pockets better on this bag - holds small items more securely - and the strap webbing is better quality with this model bag over the other one I got.I've written the review for the larger Case Logic PSL-46 on Amazon, so I won't repeat the details here.""

"20100713","5.0","Nice handy case for my Canon SX20 mid-sized camera.","Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:***** Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!This fits my Canon SX20 mid-size camera quite well, and should fit most cameras up to 5' x 4' x 3.5' in size.  Inside the case, a zippered pocket on the inside of the top zippered lid stores memory cards.  A 5'x4' stiff piece of padding secured with elastic bands allows you to store cables and larger accessories inside the case while keeping the items separated from the camera.  If you do not choose to store anything inside this slip pocket, the 5'x4' padding insert can also serve as additional protective padding for your camera.On the outside on both sides of the case, two more zippered pouches can store batteries, memory cards, and other accessories.  The case is rigid enough to stand upright by itself.  A detachable shoulder strap, sewn belt loop, and top grab handle allow for flexible carrying options.For the larger mid-sized cameras that may fit inside this case, I would have preferred that the shoulder strap came with metal clips attaching to metal D-rings on the case, instead of the plastic shoulder strap clips and D-rings that are on this case.  This is just a nitpick though.  I just find that plastic shoulder strap clips can fatigue and wear out over time with repeated use and repeated attachment/detachment.Overall, this is a very stylish case at a competitive price point.""

"20100701","4.0","Good budget camera case in a smaller size","This case perfectly fits my Fujifilm HS10, almost like it was made for it. It's nicely constructed and a light weight, smaller case. For hiking and other things that I want more padding for, I'll keep on using my Lowepro, but for going out to fairs and such with my family I love the size of this case.The strap clips and the rings to hold them are plastic, the zipper works smoothly, and it's well stitched together. I wish it did have a little more padding on the sides.The pockets are a nice generous size on the sides to hold extra batteries and other small extras and there is a pocket that will fit extra memory cards well. Because it's a smaller case, it's very easy to carry without it getting in the way. Usually with my bigger Lowepro case, I wind up handing the case off to my son or husband to carry while I'm taking pictures.The strap is easily adjustable and seems very secure. There is also a loop on the back if you want to put it on a belt instead but it seems a little big to wear that way.""
"20100701","4.0","Perfect fit for my full size flash unit and accessories..","While a Canon 40D DSLR with even a 17-85mm lens will not fit with the top closed (body alone will), perhaps some of the smaller DSLRs will, and certainly most all the point and shoot types with extended lenses will.Although this is listed as a 'camera case' don't forget it can be used for many other items also...For me, this is perfect fit with my full size flash unit used with DSLRs and also all the items needed with it.Flash, bracket, cord, reflector /diffuser, spare batteries etc.Great when worn on the belt, no need to have the flash stuck in your pocket or waist band waiting for use.  Quick to open zippered top gets it out fast when needed, and much less chance of dropping the flash when it's not in use.Even works well with the remote cord still attached to the camera and flash, just zip the top closed except for the area where the cord comes out. Of course, you need a cord long enough to allow you to bring the camera up to your eye, and most are.(This is also a perfect size for a GPS with all it's assorted cables and mounts if you have the need)Very nice that they put a handle on the top, don't usually see a bag this size with one.Also, if you want to use the included shoulder strap rather than the belt loop, the strap can extend to 25 inches at it's longest adjustment.Reasonable price for this well made, and good looking bag, I have a couple of other Case Logic bags and they hold up well.Comes with a 25 Year Warranty!""
"20100630","5.0","Fits my Nikon D5000(DSLR)!","I've been on the hunt for a small camera bag that will hold just my Nikon DSLR. I was unsure if it would fit in this bag just based on the photo, but it does! I have a backpack camera bag that holds all my lenses, batteries, chargers etc with some room to spare. But sometimes I just want something for a hike or outing that will protect my camera without adding more bulk for me to carry.It's not the smoothest fit, and probably another inch would make it perfect. But, for what I need this fits the bill. I use the 18-55mm lens most, and that is what I'm going by as for fitting or not fitting. If I decide to use larger lens, that will not go into this bag. The little side pockets will fit a spare battery and SD cards, as well as my wireless remote. My full size charger will not be squashing it's way in, but that's not a problem for me.I'd wanted something with a belt loop as well as a shoulder strap, and this as both. I like the pop of orange-red color on the inside. This will also be a great bag if I decide just to carry along a point and shoot and my flip cam with accessories.

I have a set of filters in one of the side pockets and a couple batteries and extra card in the other. I put the whole camera case inside my look alike, larger bag. Since it zips around the top, I can get the camera in and out without any problem at all. When I want to just carry the camera and few accessories, I pull it out and I'm off. I don't know how I ever got along without it. If you love your DSLR but hate carrying a camera bag (of any size), this little CASE is the perfect thing for you.""

It isn't gigantic, which I like, easy to carry around.  I can put money or a debit card inside and leave my pocketbook at home.  The bag can also be attached to your belt to keep your hands free.  I wouldn't personally use this feature, but I know some people might like it.  Overall, I am really impressed with the high quality and I'm sure I will get a lot of use out of the case.

"20100619","5.0","Well made, nice looking camera case","This is a well made case and looks great. Material is strong but not too rough. Two side pockets each with a little net pouch inside.

It comes with a shoulder strap and a belt loop.It is a very handsome case, black with nice lines and a touch of red here and there. Inside is gray (or silver) making it nice and light to see what's in there.The problem is the Amazon (sold by Adorama) description does not give you a clear idea what camera this is for. It is too small for a DSLR (like a D300s or even a D50) yet quite large for your basic point and shoot. Other info I have says it ' Fits Canon PowerShot SX20 IS, Nikon Coolpix P100, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35 and similarly sized cameras.' My old Olympus 2500 fits quite well.

"20120405","5.0","All you would imagine for a great case for an ultra zoom camera","I bought this case with my Panasonic Lumix FZ-47 and it's absolutely great. The camera fits perfectly well inside, padded inside protecting the camera very well, the camera's strap fits inside too, and the charger fits inside the side pocket, and you could even carry one or two extra batteries in the other side pocket. A small inner pocket fits an extra SD card. I put the removable case's strap in one of the side pockets. It's like the case was made for this camera, with all the great quality CaseLogic implies.The only down side (trying hardly to look for one) is that there's no place to store the attachable plastic lens hood that comes with the camera (the one used to shoot with lots of sun, to reduce glare). Nevertheless I think most of you won't ever use that, and it would make no sense to have a much bigger case just to store that in. I mean, I could make it fit below or on top of the camera and properly close the case, but it requires to pay attention when packing, and maybe loosing some of the cases's protective functions as the camera would be in contact with that hood.Last minute edit: Checking out the FZ47 owner's manual, it looks that you can attach the lens hood in 'reverse direction' to the camera when you are not using it, and it stays there fine.. So the case fits the camera also with the lens hood.No down side then.The case is absolutely great for my Lumix FZ 47. I absolutely recommend it.""

"20120223","5.0","Perfect Fit!","I purchased this camera case for my new Sony Cybershot DSC-HX100V (long zoom camera).  My husband was skeptical that this case would be big enough from the measurements in the description but from the picture I was confident that it would fit ok.  We received the case in the mail yesterday and I was very happy with the purchase.  The camera fits very nicely and I feel is very secure within the case.  The handle, strap, and belt carrying options will come in very handy.  I have not tried it yet but I'm confident that the charger and usb cords will fit within the side pockets as well.  And at a little over $12 this is a great deal!""
"20120219","5.0","That 'just right' fit","I just purchased the Sony DSC HX100V and was not willing to pay over $50 for the case Sony recommended for the camera, so I came here and found this gem. Its a snug fit, but by no means to tight. With two side pockets, a inside pocket, and a inside divider (I guess that's what it's called?), this bag is exactly what my new camera needed. The carrying strap is also the perfect length for my taste, long enough to carry over my shoulder comfortably...not too long that its knocking me in the legs and not too short that its a struggle to sling over my back. I cannot say enough good things about this simple little bag!""
"20120217","4.0","Decent Case for Canon PowerShot SX20is","I wanted an inexpensive case for my Canon PowerShot SX20is.  Reviews didn't provide a whole lot of guidance as to what cases would/would not fit this camera, so I took a chance on this one.  I need to put the camera in vertically (would prefer horizontally, but it won't fit that way) which is not a problem, because it's adequately protected. There's a zippered pouch inside that can hold sd cards and another area that could accommodate lens tissue.  Two additional pouches on outside could hold extra batteries and ??All in all, a decent case at a decent price.""
"20120215","5.0","Great Product","It's really perfect for my canon Rebel T3 but somehow I found it tight but anyway design, materials and the product finish are perfect :)""
"20120213","5.0","VERY GOOD CASE","This case is the perfect size... not too small and not too big. My Nikon zoom fits perfectly. I love the side zip pockets too.""
"20120211","5.0","WOW!","With my Z990 Kodak camera, this was the best deal that i made in this couple few times, good bag, very protected, with a lot of pockets that you can put battery, SDHC, cables and everything!Fits good with the camera with big lens and big zoom!""
"20120211","5.0","Great case for my Nikon Coolpix P500!!","I bought this for my Nikon Coolpix P500 camera. I wanted a case that would protect my new $320.00 camera, but also didn't cost as much as the camera did. I also didn't wanted something clunky, geeky and cumbersome to lug around. This fits the job. It does what it is supposed to do at an economical price. It protects the camera with padding inside, and with the shoulder belt, I can carry it withouf any trouble. There is also room for everything I need to use the camera. There is a small zippered pocket on each side of the case that has another smaller netted pocket inside. Each pocket is able to hold an extra media card and battery. In the main compartment, I can fit the camera, with attached strap and USB cord. At the top of the case inside, there is a zippered compartment that I can fit the small AC adapter plug.No problems here. I have no problem recommending it. This is one of 7 Case Logic cases I've purchased over the years for various electronics and I find that they're attractive, comfortable, durable and long lasting.""

"20120210","4.0","GREAT DEAL","Hi everyone, actually this is the 1st time write a review. from my experience I got a great deal for this product.""
"20120208","5.0","Z990 Kodak camera a perfect fit.","This bag was recommended when I bought my new Kodak Max Z990 camera, just after Christmas. The camera fits perfect, not loose, but not snug, either. Room for the manual, 4 extra batteries, extra SD cards and the camera strap(which I don't normally use). The bag comes with a top handle and  belt loop or 'fingers' grip on the back, 2 side pockets and another inside pocket. And the price can't be beat. I bought a similar Case Logic case with my Sanyo digital movie camera last year and was very pleased, also, with that. Good quality, well padded, and durable.""
"20120207","5.0","a complemetary gift","I have bought this to be used with a Coolpix P 500. But, when a receive the Nikon package, it came with a Nikon nice small bag. So, I'm using it with my GoPro 2.""
"20120206","3.0","I "works" but...","I have a Canon Rebel T3 with the standard lens. The camera and lens fit pretty snuggly into the bag, almost to the point of not fitting. But it works, kind of, and looks nice.I have two problems, though, which have brought me to buy another bag.#1 - The bag is small, like I said. The problem? The way the camera fits best is with the lens down (because the attached strap won't really fit and the back is wider than the front). Not a big deal if you lay it on it's side or something but if you stand it up like it's supposed to be, the lens gets the brunt of you setting it down. I didn't think much of this, thinking the case was protecting it, but the other day my camera would not take any pictures when on Auto Focus. I could shoot using manual focus, or use the video mode, but the auto focus is really the only reason the camera is so easy to use. Turns out my lens ring was jammed and I had to pull it out a little forcefully to get it to 'pop' out. This may be baseless, but I blame the way the camera sits in this case for the problem since it jams the lens into the camera a little when you set it down.#2 - The bag is small :) There's just no storage at all other than two small pockets on the outside. It won't even fit the battery charger. And if you had a bigger lens? Forget about it.So I gave it three stars because I can't prove the case is what caused my lens problem (though it makes complete sense) and also, the size is a preference thing. I would prefer to be able to store some of the accessories with my camera.""
"20120204","5.0","Not too big , not too bulky","I bought this case for my NIKON P500 , works well with all I need to carry. I would recommend this to any one not needing a lot of space.""
"20120201","4.0","Ok to buy","It is worth for price. Power shot cameras will fit in this. But canon HS 30, 40 will be little stretched to fit in this. If you use these cameras, only camera can keep inside.""
"20120201","3.0","Way too small","This bag is way to small for my Canon Rebel T3. The pockets on the side dont fit much and my camera fits inside but very tight. It needs more protection and cushion for the camera. Other than that its a good bag for the price.""
"20120201","4.0","Zoom Camera Case","Nice Case, with slight padding...very pleased with quality and size for my zoom camera.  The handle makes it nice to carry by hand or you can use the stap for hands free carry.""
"20120129","5.0","Perfect fit for Panasonic FZ35","I was looking for a camera bag for my son's Panasonic FZ35 that wasn't too bulky, yet had adequate protection and a few pockets for flash cards, spare battery, etc. This one fit the bill perfectly. Nice snug fit, with good padding all around. I like the top loading option without a bulky Velcro closure and I also like the handle/strap carrying options. This bag is small enough that it could fit inside a backpack for day trips, thus avoiding unwanted attention but affording extra protection.""
"20120128","3.0","Fits for Panasonic DMC-FZ40","I bought DCB-304 for my new Panasonic FZ40 and its fits almost well: just for the camera, charger, cable and one or two memory cards (nothing else). The case is compact and easy to carry. There is not enought space so it could be very annoying if you need to use your camera frequuently. This is not a profesional but a funny and beatiful case.""
"20120127","5.0","Perfect for Canon SX40","I got this for my new Ultra-zoom Canon SX40 and it is perfect. When I unwrapped it, it looked like it may be small, but everything fits perfectly. I was able to keep the battery charger in the main part and put the usb cord in one of the side pockets. I also bought this lens hood: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KSS4XI/ref=oh_o00_s00_i01_details and that fits right in the main compartment too. Highly recommend.""

"20120117","5.0","Excellent choice for the Nikon L105","Like many of you with Nikon L105/110/120s I was looking for a long zoom case. I was afraid this one would to be too small judging from the pictures but it's quite perfect.Very nice quality case as well. If you're like me and grabbed one of the $99 L105's from black Target on black friday, this sub $15 case is will be a perfect match.""
"20120117","5.0","Good case for a large point and shoot or a small SLR","I bought this for a Nikon P500 - a 36X point and shoot.  The camera easily fits.  I also got two spare batteries, a charger including car cord, several spare SD cards in the case.  The pockets for the extra stuff are quite full, the camera compartment less so.  I wouldn't want the case to be bigger but bigger side pockets wouldn't hurt.  There is also a neck strap and it's made where you could put it on your belt.  Seems well constructed and I like the contrasting red accents.""
"20120112","5.0","my logical decision paid off","case in point, this is a great bag for my fuji s2950, enough room for the camera and strap, and extra batteries in the side compartment. its a case logic so its well made.""

"20120109","2.0","Very small","I brought it thinking i can store more than one lens or camera and lens, yet to my surprize it was to small and barely fit the lens itself. its seems sturdy yet only time will tell!

"20120108","5.0","Perfect fit for Canon SX40 HS","After reading many positive reviews, i got one for my SX40 HS. It's a perfect fit.

"20111231","5.0","Warning! Does not fit the Fujifilm HS-20EXR with Lens Hood","I ordered this case from the 'Buyers also bought this' recommendation right under the Fujifilm HS-20EXR.  You may be happy with this if you don't mind having to force the camera in the bag for a very tight fit.  Keep in mind that the lens hood must be off for the camera to fit at all.  So unless you are making a transatlantic crossing in a rowboat where there's a paucity of space you better get a larger case.  With that said I think it is a great case for a smaller camera; as luck would have it my wife's camera fits in it and she has claimed it.  The case rates 5 stars but the fact that it does not fit the camera that it was recommended for... well...no stars.""
"20111228","5.0","Fit's like a glove for Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX100V","I bought a new Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX100V for my wife as a Christmas present but it did not come with a case.  I looked through Amazon and found this one.  Although I didn't see anyone mentioning the specific camera that I have, the reviews are great and the price is right.  It finally arrived! Took it out of the packaging and unzipped the main compartment and placed the camera in place.  The spacing is perfect like it was made for a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX100V.  It has enough pockets to fit few extra batteries, memory and the charger (may be a bit tight, but it does fit).  I love that all the openings are zippered and not velcro.  It opens from back to front and a belt loop for situations where you don't want the case to be swinging around.  Since I just got this case, I don't know how well it will protect the camera in a long run.  The padding looks sufficient for everyday use and then some.  I am certainly very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.""
