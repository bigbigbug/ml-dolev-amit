"20080513","3.0","Works as a camera case, but...","I purchased this case to protect my new Sony Cybershot W150.  It's a compact designed case and the camera fits nicely inside.  However, the smaller compartment does not comfortably hold accessories, namely the battery case for the camera (it fits in the compartment but appears to stretch the case slightly).  On top of that, this camera case does not come with a shoulder strap or clips to attach a shoulder strap; it's meant to be placed on your belt.  It's good for protecting a compact cybershot camera, but if you prefer a case with a shoulder strap you'd be better off looking at a different case.""
"20120214","5.0","Great little case that works for what it's designed for.","This case is great for a little travel case that you can use for almost any 'compact' point-and-shoot model of camera.  I personally have the Sony DSC-HX9V (also HIGHLY recommended) and it fits in this case very well.  It's a bit snug since the HX9V is a 'chunkier' model of point and shoots (still very compact, but bigger due to being crammed with high end technology and a lot more options/capabilities vs. most any other point and shoot camera) but this just makes for a very secure fit.  It also contains a small little front pouch that is perfect for storing a few extra memory cards and/or an extra battery.  About the only negative I have for this case is if you manage to get anything on your camera's screen (oil from fingerprints, etc.), they seem to almost absorb into the fabric of the interior of the case and can cause smudging on the screen later on, even if the screen is clean when you first put it in the case.  Otherwise though, a great little case that won't scratch up the screen of your camera and holds a couple little extras if you'd like.""
"20120206","3.0","Not Quite as Good as I  had Hoped","I have had this case about two months. The materials and design are OK. However, I am disappointed with the workmanship of the case.

The case still 'works,' but I probably would not have bought it if I knew it would start to come apart in so short a time. I did not see this defect listed in the other reviews, so maybe it's just my bad luck...""

"20111103","5.0","Great, and love it","I receive this case last night thank you for a very fast shipment. As soon as I open a package I immediately put my new Sony HX9V in, and love how it fit. It fit very well not too lose not too tide, and perfect. HX9V is one of the biggest points and shoot camera ant it fit well so anything that smaller will fit in this case. The little pocket in front is look nice, and have space for may be one or 2 batteries but not together with SD card. In my opinion this is a case for you to carry on your belt while you are out for a day or two so if you have 32 G SD and one spare battery should be enough leave the charger and other SD card in your travel camera bag. It looks good with SONY logo on it. I am very happy with the price and how it made.Pro: look very nice not cheap, best for the price form this seller, ship fast on time, well made , fit perfect, enough room for batteries, perfect for a day or two out on tours, party, wedding or any photo shoot. Loop belt seem to be very strong and secure, the padding is a good protection for this camera. Seem like it will protect from the rain, splash, but if it drop in the water will not be good. The zips open both ways all the way down make it easy to pool out the camera, and you can leave the camera strap out or in side as your convention. I have Canon lather case before and the strap go through the little hole on the top make it too hard to pool out the camera.Con: No strap, but you don't really need it, there is a little room inside that SONY can make a little pocket for SD card, and it will be perfect.I give it 5 stars for every thing""

"20111022","5.0","Using this case for Sony DSC-HX9V","A good case for the Sony DSC-HX9V that I purchased - I had to stuff this case in the beginning so it would expand a bit, since I admit it was a bit too snug of a fit for the camera at first (my personal opinion), but after I took out the stuffing and put the camera in a day later, it was much better.  Although I don't put anything besides the camera in this case, it appears you could fit at most an extra SDHC card in the front mesh pocket, but that's about it.  The case has a strap on the back if you want to strap it on a belt or something.  I looked at all the different cases available for the Sony DSC-HX9V and even purchased a Built NY case for it at first (which was significantly too tight for the DSC-HX9V), but to me, I feel that this Sony case is one of the better cases out there for the camera (for the price and quality) and I am happy with my purchase.""
"20111020","5.0","Very Reasonably Priced, Good Quality Camera Case for Sony's","The LCSCSQ case is a high quality, reasonably priced carry case for a wide range of Sony portable Cybershot cameras. Check your model first for sizing, but I'm using mine with the DSC-HX9V, which fits snugly in the case and zippers shut without much problem. The case has a textured nylon and synthetic leather body, and it feels high quality and well built. There is a small pouch in the front held closed with a Velcro zip at the top (this would hold one 'G' size battery, or a couple of memory cards, as long as they are not in a plastic case. There is an integrated belt look on the back of the case for belt mounting.What's not to like? When cases like this can easily run $30 to $40 dollars (and some of Sony's cases indeed do) a case at this price is a no-brainer. Five stars for price and quality.Final Note:There is one aspect to this case I'm not too wild about. The belt loop on the back of the case, which allows you to mount the case on your belt for easy carrying, is wide enough to make the case wobble a bit on the belt. It's not a big deal, but when I compare it to other cases I've owned, it seems a bit of a strange design. But it works fine once you get the case properly oriented on your belt. Some people may actually prefer this wider loop design, but I prefer something a bit more tight.""

Okay, with that said, I like the feel, the size, and the minimalist features. I simply wanted a small pouch to store the camera in order to keep dust etc out of its crevices: and it does it with style! I did not want shoulder straps. The single downside is not so down: the inside sleeve space allows for only a couple of spare memory sticks: there's no AA battery space. But who cares, it does the 'protection job' 100% righteously!

This case does not have enough room to hold any cables for connecting to a computer or TV, nor does it have enough room to carry extra hardware like a charging doc (most Sony point-and-shoots require a charging doc that plugs into the wall).

The only sacrifice you have to make is that now the outer pocket cannot take anything. But I do not plan on leaving my two NP-BG1 batteries and SD card (all in plastic cases) there in the first place.For smaller cameras (HX7V, 5V, etc), I assume the outer pocket would be less of an issue for storing such items.

The size was perfect for the sony cameras and the extra little pocket stores my 2 extra batteries and an extra memory stick.  Even with all of this, it still fits in a coat pocket.  The carrying strap fits my hand well and is a good change from the long neck strap on my previous case that I always ended up wrapping around my hand anyways.

"20091122","5.0","Nice camera bag. Wish it was smaller.","I bought this camera bag for my Sony WX1 digital camera, which is very small. This means that the camera does not fit snug in the bag.

There is enough room to fit an extra battery or something else in with it, but I don't do that so as not to scratch the camera.With that being said, the front pocket of the bag is only large enough to fit a memory stick or cleaning cloth, which is really dumb. It seems like this bag was designed for the thicker, larger digital cameras from a couple of years ago. It would be a much better camera bag for the newer, smaller digital cameras being made now, if it was much smaller and maybe had more room in the front pocket.However, it is very sharp-looking, is a great value for the price, and would be great for many of the cameras that are not as small and thin as mine.""
"20091101","4.0","A great little pouch, just wish it had more storage pockets","I got this mainly because of the belt-strap on the back.  It's made of a nylon-polyester type strap which is very strong.  Previous camera cases just never lasted as their straps always got ripped off when I got the pack snagged on objects I walked past.  This case was different and I still have yet to see it wear out after much pulling and snagging.  Bravo to the designers.My only gripe with this case is, however, that there are few pockets for accessories, like the Manfrotto camera stand, or the extra battery, or even a Gary Fong flash diffuser.  I wish there were more.Still, it's a good solid case and I recommend it to those with few accessories for their point-n-shoot.""

"20090508","5.0","Great buy. You should get this!","If you have a Sony Cybershot digital camera, you should get this case to protect it. I bought 3 different cases for my new WSC-290 because I could't find the right one, and then I came across this. It is better than the LCS-CST soft carrying case because it has a zipper that encloses your camera all the way. If you drop it accidentally in water, there's a good chance you can prevent water from getting inside the case compared to the Velcro lock of the LCS-CST soft carrying case. I also bought the Sony LCS-TWE soft carrying case with carabineer (available in different colors) but it only looks cute, not sturdy.This also has a front pocket and a strap in the back that can be attached to your belt or bag if you get tired of holding it.""
"20090331","5.0","Good product, wrong advertisement","This pouch is very good and compact. It fits my Sony DSC T-700 really well, along with the connecting cable and extra batteries and extra memory stick but I Actually got this item for my old Sony P-72 digital camera and it does not fit in this case.Luckily, my P-72 fits on the old case I used for my DSC T-700, therefore I finally ended up trading cases and is fine now.""
"20090329","5.0","Great Case","bought this for my DSW-150 the fit is great the protection is also great, someone made an issue about it not having a shoulder strap, mine did not come with any as well, for me that was not in issue, for security reasons, i carry mine in a bag or in my pocket. the case in not that big, there is room for the camera, there is a small pocket in front for a memory card, i can also carry the card reader in the pocket. Again this is a great buy, it has its purpose, if you need a bigger case, this is not for you, if you want a case that will provide you with adequate protection without the bulk, there is none better as a choice.""
