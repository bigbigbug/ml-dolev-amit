"20120524","1.0","Produces the grainiest picture ever","My 3-year old Canon Ixus 80IS finally died late last year (after dropping it on the floor many times) and I was hunting for a good deal on cameras. This model came on sale at Target in November for $80 plus a $10 gift card. I was happy when I took it out of the box... the red color was a nice touch. However, my heart sank as soon as I started taking pictures. Old cameras tend to produce grainy photos at low light settings, but even in a well-lit room the pictures from this camera were so grainy. Dismayed, I returned it to Target and researched the Ixus counterpart in the US, which turned out to be the Powershot ELPH 100 series. I waited (around 6 months) for the price to drop to $102 and then I grabbed it. It's well worth the wait. Stay away from this A2200 piece of junk.""

"20110511","4.0","Light, fun, plastic","I loved the price on this Canon. I recently sent a digital Elph through the wash and needed a replacement. I was looking for a good price point that would still produce a quality image. This camera is great fun with many features including all of the treatments such as toy, fisheye, miniature... There are enough controls for those with DSLR experience to keep you interested and enough features to make experimenting fun. But it's also terrific if you just want to turn it to auto and snap away. The micro mode works very well. Photos are crisp and clear. Very nice low light photos.As other folks who have purchased the camera have discovered, the cover on the port for downloading pictures is flimsy. I also was a little disappointed in the plastic feel of the camera (My ruined Elph was metal), which detracts from the aesthetics, but the price point and the lightness make up for it. I would have paid a bit more for metal.All around it's a great buy. I wouldn't buy anything but Canon for consistent color, quality, and breadth of fun and useful features.""

"20110429","4.0","Better than I thought it would be!","I have my Powershot A2200 for about two weeks now. I was a little concerned about the mixed reviews but I thought I would take a chance. I have and love my Canon G10 but did not want to carry it everywhere with me.  I needed a little camera to carry with me and not worry about. I purchased my Powershot A2200 for 129. and could not complain about that. I liked how you can move through the different modes quickly and I especially liked the live mode. I am an artist and it is very important for me to control color and contrast and I can easily do that in the live mode. I understand the problems some of the other reviews complained about especially the blurriness. I too had blurry photos when I first started using it. This camera has a learning curve - it is a very sensitive camera and you have to become familiar with it and choose the mode ( program, live , auto ) that is best for you. Also there are several options to control in the focus of the camera. I suggest you become familiar with it to improve your results.  This is a good camera for someone like myself that is familiar with using cameras and want options for controlling images.  If you just want to point and shoot and not think about it - this may not be the best choice. I am really impressed with the photos I have taken. I mainly use the live mode - it is a very flexible mode - shooting well in low museum light and even out of a fast moving car.  Given what I received for this cost I am very pleased. I love my little light canon camera.""
"20110425","2.0","Not up to Canon's standards","Canon cameras have always been the best for the money, not this one.  Although the camera has numerous features that are attractive there are two issues that detract, Lag time and battery life.  When the battery is freshly charged the lag time is comparable to the SD line of cameras.  After ten to 15 shots the lag time gradually gets too long. I would not recommend using it for shooting pictures at an event, it ma be okay for still lief pictures.  The battery is a lithium-ion, same as the SD series.  However, it is rated at only 740 mAh compared to 940 mAh on the SD series.  On a recent trip the battery died after seven hours of usage.  Today the battery monitor said I had used 1/3 of the capacity in 2.5 hours.  I recommend spending the extra money on the SD series or buying a different brand.""

"20120410","5.0","Great Camera","I recently lost my other camera which was an Olympus and I didnt care much for it anyway. I decided to look for a relatively innexpensive camera.

This camera is very light, simple to use. I am no avid photographer but for what I need it for it works great. I take pictures of my friends and I out on our motorcycles, Messing/driving around our classic cars, and I occasionally sell stuff on Ebay. When you zoom in on something it doesnt get grainy like most other cameras I have had in the past. It is very slim to and doesn't create too much bulk in your pocket. Only downside of it is you cannot take any pictures without an SD memory card in it. Some other cameras you can atleast take a few on the camera's memory. But, you cannot with this one. But, Im sure everyone by now has a couple SD cards lying around their houses, and they are really cheap at walmart or target.""

"20120327","5.0","Works Wonderfully. Get it!","Ignore all the negative nancy's on here. I feel like they're not realizing that this is JUST a compact camera.. It's not going to take the same pictures as a DSLR. If you want a camera that takes professional looking photos, drop another 700-900 dollars on a nice camera.This camera is great for the price it's being sold at. First of all, it's a Canon; there's no going wrong with these cameras. I have a Canon Rebel t3i and t2i but wanted a smaller canon to carry around in my purse. This Power Shot is great, the 14 MP *along with* my 32G memory card allows for really great, clear pictures. Obviously if one is moving rapidly and shaking the camera, you can not expect any camera to take a clear picture, but with good lighting or a flash, this Power Shot takes clear pictures. Even when there was low lighting, the camera still takes decent pictures (but not as clear).I've taken this camera on several rendezvous over the past month since I've gotten it, and have used it at the beach (high light exposure), camping in the mountains (fire and nature), at parties (people moving very quickly), and on rainy days (poor natural lighting). This camera succeeds my expectations for a compact camera, and wherever my pictures are posted of these events, people always complement them and suggest that I 'bring my camera next time we all go out'.""

"20120324","1.0","Not even close.","I have to say, this is the disappointment of the year.  This camera is horrible quality, every picture I took looked blurred or slightly off focus.  The auto function setting was intolerably long between clicking the button and the actual picture taking.  After several seconds of auto-focusing, flashing orange lights at the subject, and then finally flashing, the picture was still out of focus and washed out or blurry.  The flash is too bright so your subject is bleached with an over abundance of light.  Trying to take pictures of pets was impossible because it took several seconds flashing the pet with this orange light that ultimately make the pet look away so all you get is a blurry side of it's head.  Let's move on to video.  Fuzzy, low quality, bad resolution, poor sound. Everything about this camera was a disappointment, only the shape and size was acceptable. I owned a Canon A20 10 years ago and the picture quality from that 2 megapixel camera was far better than this.  I think Canon has really dropped the ball on this one.  Do not waste your time and money, your cellphone takes better pictures than this.""

"20120121","5.0","Mom armed with Canon = Every Kid's worst nightmare","I love this camera. I have owned a Samsung camera, I paid over $200 for, it was also a good camera. When it broke after about 2 years, I bought a Fuji. We don't use that one anymore because it took too many blurry pictures. I got this Canon camera because it was on sale at Target. Target gave us a $30 gift card for buying it. What a deal!  It has a lot of modes to choose from, should satisify the simple shooter to those looking to take better and varied pics for something like a SCRAPBOOK anyone?!? The fish eye effect would rarely be used, but you see its interesting for funny photos (they picture a dog that was shot using the 'fisheye' effect above). Maybe if you hate someone from work you can use fisheye and make their nose look huge then tag it on facebook, I don't know. Hehe.But here are some of the features:First of all, you can always change the settings of the timer, flash, and display (you can have the date show on the pictures...or choose not to) no matter which types of pictures you wish to take. You always have the options to change those things.Now for the meat: The notches you can choose on the wheel up top are: Program, Live, Auto, Easy, Scene, Effect (I guess I'll call this one that), Discreet, and Video.Program mode, you can adjust all of these settings:ISO speedWB setting (white balance I think)My Colors (black/white, sepia, custom, etc.)Single shot or Continuous shotEvaluate (brightness based on overall scene)Size of the shot (From 4320x3240 for 16x20 inch pictures down to 640x480 for email attachment pictures...they also include a widescreen option)Normal quality or Fine qualityLive mode you can adjust:Dark --------------  LightNeutral ------------VividCool ---------------WarmI never use that mode.The auto mode they choose all the settings for you other than:Size (16x20' quality or email attach quality, and all the qualities in between)Normal quality or Fine qualityEasy mode, you cannot change anything other than the things you can always change, like timer, display, and flash. Guess they wanted to make easy mode...well...easy.For Scene mode, the choices you have the options to adjust depend on the scene you select, for instance, if you choose portrait you cannot adjust white balance, but if you choose blur reduction, you can. The scene modes you can choose are: Blur reduction, portrait, landscape, kids&pets, smart shutter, low light, beach, foliage, snow, fireworks, and long shutter.In effect mode (don't know what it's actually called, but in function set the effects are the things at the top you can change) you can change the effect; choose from fisheye, miniature, toy camera, monochrome (b/w, sepia), super vivid, and poster effect (a unique feature). In most of those effects you can change to normal or continuous shot, and normal or fine quality. Some you can also change the picture size.Discreet mode is fantastic, you can take pictures quietly and discreetly, all you hear is a tiny 'click'. Won't even wake a sleeping baby, trust me. You can adjust white balance, colors, single or continuous shots, picture size, and quality normal or fine.Video you can adjust standard or miniature effect, white balance, colors, and quality from HD movie 1280 or down to 320 (longer movie, lower image quality)There is also a zoom in/zoom out on this camera, and a massive amount of other things you can do as well...like downgrading the picture size after it has been taken, viewing slideshows, etc.  You really would need to read the book to learn of the full potential of this camera. I recommend this camera. I do get some blurry pictures, but not too many. The stats on blur are probably about 1/10 really blurry, and 2/10 slightly blurry (from an isolated blurry arm to edging seems a tiny fuzzy). Most of them are clear. The pictures I take are mostly pictures of my kids at home. I love this camera, and I hope you do too if you decide to buy it.I hope that helps you all make your decision, and you are welcome!""

It isn't bad because it's an inexpensive camera, it's just bad. I don't trust the Canon name anymore.Even in ideal lighting conditions most pictures turn out awful. The other day I took my son out to the zoo. It was really nice out - sunny, but not too bright. I thought I could trust the A2200.First picture (auto mode): the lighter colors are washed out (with white patches, even), the rest of the colors are muddled. Fuss with the settings a bit - my son's pink cheeks are blotchy red, his jeans are neon blue. Fuss with them a little more - his face is either bright white or bright pink, his hair is either gray or dark brown with a funny looking 'crown' of reflected light. He is either frozen by an overly-aggressive flash, or he looks like a grainy blur. I finally fuss with it enough to get a really fantastic looking picture (as good as I would NORMALLY get with any of my other/previous cameras) and the next ten pictures I take look overexposed. Sometimes I can get a good photo - but most of them are way off.This camera might be fine for some people, but from my experience it is not a good camera compared to others in the same price range. Keep looking.""
"20120116","4.0","Not Bad At All","I needed to take pictures for my college graduation and reception, and I felt my old Samsung Digimax 4.0 MP camera was due for a retirement. After reading reviews, I bought this PowerShot thinking it would be somewhat of an improvement. That was an understatement. It's such a great little camera. I'm so used to changing AA batteries every couple of times after using the flash on my old camera, yet the PowerShot didn't need to be charged for weeks after taking hundreds of pictures.Even though it takes great pictures, it has a major flaw, but it's not the camera's fault. If you're not a person who is up to speed on the auto-focus feature on digital cameras, it might take a bit of practice to understand how it works. I let my mom use the camera at my field of study's pre-graduation ceremony and she had such a hard time taking pictures. I had her take a few practice shots the day before and even though she struggled a bit, I thought she would be able to use it well. Nope. She was highly frustrated with the auto-focus and hated the idea of not being able to just point and click. Instead, it's more like point, lightly hold down, wait, then click. After the ceremony, she told me she didn't like the camera at all and would be using the old digital camera from now on (which didn't have the precision auto-focus).My own complaint would be the zoom feature. If you zoom too far, the pictures, even at a far enough distance, come out grainy and fuzzy. Still, it's a great little camera for the price. I originally was going to use the camera for graduation and sell it if I didn't like my experience with the PowerShot. I've had it for nine months so far and I have zero regrets of my purchase!""

I thought this would be a step up from my old clunky Kodak Easyshare, but found myself regretting the change.

"20120114","5.0","Excellent point and shoot for non-hobbyists","I gave this camera to my girlfriend for Xmas as her Samsung point and shoot was borrowed by one of her daughters and returned without the shutter button.  How does that happen?So to begin this review, let me start by saying the A2200 is NOT a camera for a hobbyist, semi-pro or someone wanting to shoot in manual and learn the exposure triangle.  It would NOT be my choice for a creative tool to be used to 'make art'.  However, for the vast majority of amateur camera users, who just want to point and shoot and take snapshots, this little Canon is a ton of camera for the money and all they will need.  For under $90 street price, you get a lot of bang for your buck, and much better image quality than you can get with an iphone camera.First, the lens is very good for the price class:  opens up to f/2.8, 4 times optical zoom and 28mm on the wide end.  Better specs than the lens on my $300 Canon SD780.  Second, the processor, DIGIC 4, is also very good and Canon somehow managed to pack 14.1 megapixels on to a 1/2.3' sensor without creating a noise monster.  Third, Canon figured out how to make a SMART AUTO setting that actually works properly.  For a novice or someone who just wants to take snapshots, this is all they need.  Just compose, squeeze the shutter half way to lock in focus and exposure, and snap away.  If you can't do that basic procedure, stick with your camera phone.  Seriously.  Rant:  It amazes me how many people spend no time at all composing, then they plunge that shutter button down, shaking the entire camera, not letting the poor thing autofocus.  And then they take crappy pictures and blame it on the camera.If one wants to expand their photographic envelope just a bit, the A2200 has creative filter options, such as miniature effect and fisheye, to name just two.  Also comes with a lithium rechargeable battery and more cables than my Nikon DSLR shipped with. Canon is good about giving the consumer a decent set of accessories.I've tried all the creative filters and various settings and it was not difficult for me to take a few artistic shots with the A2200.  My guess is the majority of users will keep it set to SMART AUTO and be happy with the results.Bottom line: the A2200 is an excellent choice for someone desiring an inexpensive point and shoot.  And produces much better results than a camera phone.""

I trust it would work outdoors, but I didn't spend this money to have a camera for 'outdoor use only.'  I'm not super picky about a camera, but if I have one, I do ask that it take photos! Look for a different camera!""
"20120104","1.0","Piece of junk","To start with the positive aspects of this camera first, it has a nice red colorand the time is in 24 hours and you can also adjust the date format. It alsoallows you to define a lot of settings yourself, so you do not have to dealwith automatic settings. Also it has a relatively large display so you can viewthe image. I also think it is quite easy to operate in general. To set thebasic shooting modes with a little wheel is a very good idea.However, otherwise it is basically a quite expensive piece of junk!It is probably one of the slowest digital cameras on the planet.I don't know what happened to Canon, but theymust have thought to design a retro-camera with readout out times you had withthe first digital cameras about 15 years ago. Unbelievable! If you want to makeany kind of photo of a moving object it will be moved out of the picture by thetime you can shoot the photo. Even if you try to take a photo of a static objectthe quality of the photo is poor. It is grainy, noisy, and blurry. I have setthe camera to 80 ASA, the Fine resolution and 14.1 Mpix and still got grainynoisy photos. The optics is poor, too. All photos show a blurring which you'llget from scattered light in the optical system. My son has a$25 Vivitar camera which is not only significantly faster, but the images areonly slightly worse. Now you won't expect an excellent photos with a $25 camera, butyou can expect some decent shots from a $100 camera. We also have a 4 year old Canon SD 1100ISwhich is a good camera, so I did expect that in 4 years Canon would haveinvested some money into development. Well, they did, for some gimmicks, like atoy camera effect of softening for portraits. However with this camera this is apermanent feature. Instead of wasting money for gimmicks like this it would havebeen better spending the money on developing better optics, CCDs and readoutelectronics. The A2200 is basically useless, except if you like grainy, blurryimages of something that does not move. Then this is the camera for you.So as a conclusion, the A2200 looks nice but that it. Otherwise I would notrecommend this camera at all. It's a complete waste of money.My wife actually returned it back to Walmart and got a blender instead. The money iscertainly better spend that way.""

"20111226","5.0","Great Fun for the Money","I've been into photography since high school.  I have many film and digital cameras and love to take 'great' photos.  I'm not a big fan of Photoshop.  I prefer to make minimal adjustments of contrast, saturation, etc. and let the photo speak for itself.  I got this little Canon to carry with me when I don't feel like lugging around the DSLRs...the A2200 is so small it can fit into a shirt pocket, jeans pocket or easily into a ladies small purse...very convenient.Picture quality is excellent!  I have taken low light shots at a concert, taken some cool close ups, played with the various special effects settings and had a great time creating some really interesting photos.  Beyond this the picture quality is quite good.  No it will not replace the 5d, the 7d or even a good quality Rebel, but it can take some great shots.One thing I was curious about was controlling the camera to take advantage of the f/2.8 aperture...there are no Aperture Priority modes that would think to be pretty simple to program into the camera, but if you play around enough with Live mode you can get the camera to act accordingly.  So yes, you can even take some good...on the spot portraits.For $80 this is definitely a five star camera. Probably one of the best buys in very small point & shoots out there.  Sure you can get a much better small camera with the S95, but then wouldn't you rather put that money towards a good DSLR lens?... I know I would.""

It takes the guess work out of taking a nice picture, red eye is automatic and it steadies it's self so you don't get those blurry pictures. Has some very nice and fun to use features. But it's still an easy to use camera if you want to just use the auto setting you get nice pictures without having to fuss with finding the right setting.

"20111201","4.0","Great point & Shoot Camera","I wanted a nice point and shoot camera on black Friday. Now, I am not a professional photographer, I do know the difference between a digital SLR camera and the lenses and technologies which make them such a popular choice amongst consumers, however, I wanted to get back to the basics of point and shoot. The A2200 is a great digital camera, it provides excellent optical zoom, which, to those of you aware of, is the actual camera lenses functioning to focus on an image.Digital Zoom is a feature I usually shy away from, yes, I am aware that not every single camera out there isn't going to be equiped with some form of digital zoom that relies on the camera processor putting in pixels for the image to 'appear' closer, but, still comes out grainy. So, with the auto focus, auto flash and battery fresh out of the charger, I snapped a few shots around my house. I must admit, I was a little turned off by the grainy film washed look in the LCD screen, but my photos come out gorgeous on my computer. While I don't need to edit them down from the huge 2xxx by 10xxx format I took them in, I am still experimenting with lower resolutions to find my personal 'sweet spot' that fits my needs. All of the features that come with the camera are pretty standard, including anti-blur, various scene modes and a few other options I haven't necessarily envisioned myself using but i will definitely experiment with them throughout the life of this camera.I have been using my cell phone to take pictures, which holds one major problem that digital camera's all remedy, which is a dedicated button for snapping pictures and above average anti-blur feature along with a better flash. (Honestly, I read reviews on tech websites, i don't see how the reviewers can touch the screen to take the photos without shaking and ruining the picture).I am using an 8GB memory card, it's great capacity with the max settings, I have some where around 1700 photos I can take before needing to transfer the files over.A few points I didn't touch on but, might be a selling point:Does not have a touch screen, I mean, the button layout isn't fancy, but it's made to where you can get around within a few presses.The video is so-so, but, you don't use digital camera's to record video, it's a feature i will rarely useComes with composite out cables for review on a television, cable length is pretty short, but most blu-ray players and televisions have card readers anywayNo view finder is built into this unit, get used to using the LCD screen when taking a photoI'd buy this camera for those who want a point and shoot, it's a great niche between price and function which I highly recommend coming from a FujiFilm FinePix camera with 6 less MP and 3x optical, it was a sweet deal when I got it (free) but the quality of the photos I took were often grainy, blurry and 3 out of 10 times unusable.I bought this camera on black Friday with Amazon Prime, shipped last week and due to the weekend, I received it the following Wednesday. Great camera definitely recommend it as a budget choice.""
"20111201","4.0","Good for what it is...","Let's be honest, you are not going to win any major photography awards with this camera, but this camera is not made to do that.  This camera takes pretty good looking photos (14.1 MP)& is easy to operate.  You can get more complicated, but the point & shoot feature is not bad.  All in all, it does what I need it to do, though I do which it felt a bit sturdier.  If you are looking for a inexpensive, good camera, you could do much worse.""

The A2200 is substantially cheaper than the Ixus was but it shows, it's all a bit plasticky. Seems to work OK though, in that it takes decent photos, so what do you want for $110 or whatever it was. It does seem to take a while to be ready for the next shot, maybe that's because it's writing to the card and I have a slow card? I just bought a Nikon Coolpix S3100 as well which is similar spec, slightly cheaper, and feels a bit more solidly built while being smaller, so we'll see how that works out.""

"20111101","1.0","Not a point-and-click","Unfortunately I had to return this camera. It's not a simple point-and-click and the 'auto focus' isn't quite what it's touted to be. You have to hold the shutter button down half way until it finds it's focus and then take the picture. We read the manual, tried different settings, and it's just not an easy camera for action shots (most of our pictures are action). It was a great little camera/video otherwise, but not what we needed for easy and quick photos. 3/4 of the photos I took at a wedding were blurry, didn't matter if they were inside or out.""

Lots of options.Picture is clear IF you don't just snap - it takes a second for it to focus, so push the button half-way, pause, then all the way. The only downside is that it takes a while to actually get the picture. We were at Seaworld and tried to photo the whales jumping out of the water. By the time the picture actually took, all that was left was a splash of water. So not good for instant shots, or at least I haven't figured that out yet.Worth the money.

But that takes money, and money takes time.So I decided to save up some money but still I wanted a camera. So I found this.Now it's not something that a pro would use, but what I like about it is that if you're looking to become pro, you can learn about iso and white balance while you can also play with the fun art filters and scene modes.I find the discrete mode very good if you want to take pictures of sleeping baby's and etc. The toy camera mode is great for vintage style photography.One thing that bugs me is that in low lighting the camera doesnt react well.""

"20110908","1.0","lemon","For all of the good reviews I read about this camera, maybe I got my hopes up a little too high.  It's been a week now and after about 150 pictures, it's going back tomorrow.  It's a nice small camera with some cool features, but picture quality is terrible.  My wife's old point and shoot got wet and went to camera heaven while we were on vacation, so I thought this would make a good replacement.  It was a little more than I spent on the previous camera, but Cannon has made a good name for itself and I figured it was a safe bet.  Well, I figured wrong.  Maybe one out of 10 or 15 pictures comes out decent in good conditions.  In all but bright light, it is nearly impossible to hand hold the camera and get a sharp shot.  The auto white balance is often wrong.  In bright light I get a haze over the pictures (lens flare?).  In low light I get reflections of what looks like dirt on the lens even after I have carefully cleaned the lens with a lens cloth.  Out of 150 or so pictures, I have maybe 10 decent ones and none that are any better than just decent.  Our previous point and shoot took such good pictures that I started to neglect the SLR.  This camera takes only slightly better pictures than my daughter's $20 digital camera.  With all of the good reviews I have read about this camera, maybe mine was a lemon, but I'll be gun shy when it comes to cannon in the future though.""
"20110907","4.0","Don't rely on Auto mode & you'll be happy for the price","This is not the type of camera where you can leave it on auto and assume everything will be fine. I did that but within a couple of shots I found the settings to be overly bright & very noisy as it looks like the ISO had been cranked up to 1600 (which is ridiculous for any compact) for a not so dark room. Its best to switch straight to Program mode and get accustomed with the manual controls. Thankfully Canon has realised that some people don't know anything about cameras and has provided an inbuilt help system (which can be turned on/off) to set examples of what each thing does, this can save a lot of time & avoid reading through the 200 page PDF manual! Very handy for those who are just about to leave on vacationThe discreet mode is great for those that need to take a photo but don't want to attract any attention. This mode will not use flash & will not make any sound at all aside from a tiny mechanical movement. Unfortunately the LCD screen will still continue to emit light since there is no manual viewfinder to look through. The colour reproduction is actually pretty accurate, its possible to replicate what you see with your own eyes (something that's usually impossible whilst indoors with compacts). The optical zoom mode is nice, you get a choice of both 4x optical & digital zoom of up to 16x. If you want to preserve your photos I strongly suggest turning digital mode off. Thankfully its quite obvious where the digital zoom will come into play as it'll pause for a second before continuing & you'll notice a line inbetween the zoom bar. The LCD screen itself is nice & large & easy to view under direct sunlight - a problem that arises even amongst DSLR users!Now for the bad points, the lack of IS (image stabilisation) is disappointing as a lot of images in low-lit rooms will get blurry even if your hands seem like they're barely moving. The all plastic casing is also worrying, I'm pretty sure that the tripod holder isn't even metal which means it could wear down quickly & wobble around. The delay between shots is very slow taking about 4 seconds to get from one to the next. The plastic cover that covers the USB transfer cord is also disappointing as not only is it hard to get open but feels like it'll eventually be ripped off accidentally. Although this camera seems to take good photos via manual controls you'll instantly notice upon zooming in that it'll still have digital noise including the flash shots so detail will be lost during editing even if you're only shooting in 2MP (less than 20% of its full resolution). Camera distortion is another issue with that rounded affect on straight objects at angles and a lot of the features are gimmicky and aren't helpful for anyone who's serious about photography.However I'm probably being a bit too harsh since coming from a DSLR. It is an all round good budget $100 camera & you'll no longer have to worry about using flash for dark indoor shots which usually kills the photo with false lighting. Just be warned that digital noise will popup on occasions & a few shots will get pretty blurry without image stabilisation, if this worries you, aim for something a bit better.""

I spent several weeks shopping around for a digital camera that could do it all and I think I got it when I bought this camera.  It met most of the criteria on my wish list with 14.1 MP and 720p HD video.  The X4 zoom was initially my only disappointment but after playing around, I soon discovered that it goes more than x4, just at a lower quality picture.I love how easy this camera is to use.  It takes really clear pictures with ease.  My previous digital camera had over a second delay and half the time my shots turned out fuzzy.  With the 'Easy' mode, the camera does all of the work for you and usually the camera is right.  I use this to take pictures of my 3 year old daughter who is constantly on the move and the camera takes nice clear shots.  Also the camera is fast (for a digital).  From the moment you click the button, it is only a split second before it takes the shot which makes it easy to capture the moment you want to keep.I also enjoy the 'Discrete' setting.  I used this setting while visiting a museum and I love that there was no embarrassment of beeps and clicks while I fumble with the camera to turn off the flash.  It's fast and quiet and the camera still took a good picture in low lights w/o the flash.  However I did have to rest my arm or the camera on a stable surface.I haven't played around much with the video camera yet.  The zoom lense is noisy so I think that might pick up with the sound quality but considering I had good luck with still photos on low lights, I don't think the video will be a problem as long as the camera isn't jostled too much.For the price, this is the best camera your money can buy.  I know that there are better camera's out there with more features, but this does everything I could ask and more for a family camera.""

I didn't have enough time before we left for vacation to figure out all of the options and adjust to the learning curve, but I still managed to take some excellent pictures.  I had some trouble taking good, clear pictures at night though - I couldn't get the flash to produce the clear images that I needed at times, but I think that is mainly due to my inexperience with the camera itself.  It has some cool options (miniature effect, macro mode, fisheye lens) that I played around with and turned out several great pictures.

All of the photo options are fun to tinker around with. If you don't like to mess with settings, then there is an auto mode that takes pretty good pictures. For those of us that like to have more control over the picture, there is a mode for that as well. You can't really change too much beyond shutter speed, iris, and other such basics. If you want to get really in depth, then you shouldn't be shopping for a point and shoot camera. The camera is light weight and compact. If you want something to fit into a pocket while you're out and about, then this is definitely the way to go. The last Cannon I had has held up for years. The only reason I bought a new camera was for an upgrade. Cameras have more oomph now than they did six years ago! And this one was worth the hassle of upgrading!

I don't seem to be having any problems with lag between shots, but I did notice the reviewer who complained about that said he/she was using class one and four cards (class one is very slow). I use a Transcend class 10 card, which you can get here on Amazon really cheap. No lag here, besides what would be expected of any point-and-shoot. Anyway, I am generally happy with this camera.""
"20110529","1.0","WARNING!!","I just recently bought this camera for my mom on Mother's day and it was a total waste of money! The first time she used, she loved it and the pictures came out great! We went to a concert last week and brought the camera (second time using it) and right when we turn it on THE LENS JAMMED and now it won't work. We keep receiving a message that states lens error and restart camera. Mind you, we have NEVER dropped the camera and there was no dirt or anything on the camera. It was in perfect condition! I decided to do some research to see if I could fix it myself and it turns out that a lot of their Powershot cameras have this issue and people want to charge $100 just to fix it! Might as well buy a new camera. But I'm definitely not going to buy a Canon!""
