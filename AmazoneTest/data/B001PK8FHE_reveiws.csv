"20111212","5.0","GREAT CAMERA, If You Take The Time To Read The Manual","I spent about a week reading reviews of this camera before deciding to buy one. I was shocked at the negative reviews for a Nikon (any Nikon). Among the positive reviews were notes about using the camera and READING THE MANUAL. After downloading the manual from the Nikon web site and reviewing the almost 150 pages of the manual, I understood the positive reviews that said you have to invest some time to really read the manual. Although I was still a bit nervous. I decided to go for it.I am VERY HAPPY with this camera. When first playing with it I had some oddly grainy photos. I went to the manual, figured out what I was doing wrong and tried taking the same photos in the same conditions a second time (inside closeups since that was the complaint I read about most). I got BEAUTIFUL RESULTS.If, like me, you are considering this camera and are a bit concerned about the negaive reviews, I can only say to you that THIS IS NOT A POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA. I expect it's going to take me a while to master all of the guidance in the manual, but I also expect this will be the only camera that I will need for a LONG time.If you're looking for a point and shoot camera, you might be very dissappointed with this purchase (you can almost count on that). If you're the type who's willing to invest a bit of time in the beginning in really reviewing the manual, you might be as happy as I am that I decided to buy. I LOVE THIS CAMERA even though I'll be going through the manual for a while. Beautiful camera with Beautiful results.By the way, You can use rechargeable batteries with this camera. You just have to be sure to upgrade the firmware with Ver. 1.1 on the Nikon website if your camera has the previous Ver. 1.0.""

"20111208","1.0","Horrible image quality","I've never hated a camera before.... until this one. How it ever got a good review I will never understand! The color quality is dull, the lens takes to long to focus, the flash is horrible, there are absolutely NO manual settings, and the pictures come out blurry almost everytime.  I use my phone camera over this one. There are to many pics of my kids that came out blurry for me to ever give this a good review.  Don't buy it....move on to the better one!""
"20111107","3.0","Not the quality I expected","Pros:  High resolution; great zoom; easy to use; takes video; looks coolCons:  Doesn't focus very well; all pictures are grainy unless you use the flash; occasionally freezes; poor in low lightMy suggestion:  I know this seems obvious, but really make sure you know what you're getting first.As a preface, I have to admit that I knew next to nothing about digital-still cameras before purchasing this one.  All I knew about this camera was that it had a good resolution and a very good zoom.  So I bought it.  A day or two later, I was at a Thankgiving gathering with my relatives, and I was asked to take pictures of all my cousins (who were standing still).  NOT A SINGLE PICTURE I TOOK WAS IN FOCUS.  Admittedly, I was not yet completely used to holding down the capture button half-way to focus the image first; but I was holding the camera as steadily as I could.  I know that I don't have the steadiest grip, but for a Nikon camera with 'Vibration Reduction' I expected better.  Also, even now that I know better how to use the camera, focusing in low light or over great distances is nearly impossible.  Finally, pictures tend to be very grainy whenever you don't use the flash.I have had this camera for about two years.  I would buy it again ONLY IF it had a manual focus ring.  Unfortunately, it doesn't.Hope this review helps.""
"20111007","1.0","broke within 7 months!","I ordered this camera in Nov 2010 and I loved it!  I only used it a handful of times but found it easy to use.  In July 2011, I turned on the camera and got a 'battery exhausted' error message.  So, I changed the batteries.  Still got the error message.  I changed the batteries again...and again...and again.  I changed brands, changed types, etc.  Still have the error message.  The camera is unusable which was extremely helpful considering I purchased it to use during the birth of my son in July.  Good thing I checked it to make sure it worked before heading to the hospital.  I had to use my old Kodak back-up camera.  Not sure I would ever buy another Nikon product.""
"20091224","5.0","Really Satisfied","Just ordered this camera Saturday from Amazon and got a great price as well as a good deal on 2 day shipping. It came yesterday, and I have to say that if you can't take a decent shot with, then . . .  well, I won't go there.Put in the batteries - BTW it does take rechargeable batteries if that's an issue - looked over the first 15 pages of the manual to see what was what, inserted a SD card and took pictures. It's just that simple. I used the 'easy auto' function and took it to our Christmas Eve dinner tonight and got some great pics. Yes, there were a couple less than desireable shots, but that's part of taking pics.Also, the SD card is a generic 2gb card that I got from the MicroCenter bulk pile for a couple of bucks. It formatted it and is working just fine so far.I plan on using it tomorrow for the Christmas Day festivities and getting more familiar with the controls.I'll add to the review after I get more familiar. So far I'm really pleased with this.""
"20091222","4.0","Nice little camera","I bought it as it was in 2 day delivery pack. The body of the camera is very comfortable to carry and to hold while taking the photo, has curved places for fingers on both sides. Batteries are fitted in the corner with the slot for the memory card (SD card). Very big screen LCD screen where you can see more details. I was surprised that the camera supports my language as English is not my native. The only thing missing is viewfinder but this is only my opinion. This camera will be perfect for beginners!""

"20091203","5.0","Great product for the money - can use rechargable","Hi, I bought this item from Amazon for their Thanksgiving sale. I should say it is a great product for the money I paid. I have used several 3x optical zoom cameras earlier . So, as far as optical zoom is concerned, I love this.Lots of features in it. People who rate tis item as 'crappy' did not read the manual for sure.We can use rechargable batteries as it comes with the 1.1 version firmware from Nikon. Even if your camera has 1.0 firmware, you can easily download and install the firmware with almost ultra low  work effort.I think most of te pieces sold by Amazon come with 1.1 firmware.It is decently liht in weight, easy to use and does great as far as focusing. it has all possible options to shoot all types of pictures.I will continue to write more as I explore more and more territories in the camera.....

"20091129","4.0","Great Camera","This is a Great Camera.  I read the reviews after I purchased it.  I agree that after you take it out of the box and just start shooting pictures, they may not come out very good.  That is why you HAVE TO READ THE MANUAL!  After reading the manual, I LEARNED how to take great pictures indoors, outdoors, low lighting, high lighting, it all does fantastic.  The pictures with this camera are perfect!  Very bright, sharp, detailed, etc.  If you learn how, you wont have a dull colored picture.Tip ---- Inside pics can be taken in the Auto Mode, but NOT the Easy Auto Mode.  Also make sure you use the flash.Tip ---- Very close up pics inches away, you should use the Micro or Macro mode.  You can experiment with the flash.At first I thought I got ripped off as the pictures looked terrible.  After reading the manual, I learned how to take awsome, sharp, great looking pictures.You just have to read and learn how to use all the options such as vibration, motion, etc.This isnt a point and shoot camera.  Thats why it cost more than a $89 camera.  Its a high quality camera for a low price of around $200.  I am very, very picky on picture quality.  This camera does great!So far, I think the battery life is better than the cameras I have had in the past that I paid just under $100 for.  It does take 4 AA batteries rather than 2 batteries.  You do not want to use rechargable batteries.  Just get the lithium batteries for about $7 for a pack of 4, and they last a good long time for any family get together.  If your on vacation, you can spend about $21 bucks and have about 3 sets for the whole week, even though you probably wont need them all.I had a fujifilm finepix 5mp camera that took awsome picutes with 3x optical zoom.  I traded it for a samsung 7mp 3x optical, but was disappointed.  My new nikon coolpix 10mp 15 optical takes just as great pictures as my old fuji film, but I now get 15x opt. zoom.I took a picture of our Christmas tree from across the room with my new Nikon and my guitar amplifier was in the picture. After I took the picture, I zoomed on on the picture (after it was already taken), and I could read the words on the amplifier knobs, from all the way across the room.  That really blew me away!!!If you are willing to read the manual and LEARN about the camera, then this is for you.  IF your not into tech stuff and learning about how to use something (like my elderly parents), then get a cheaper low end camera.""
"20091128","2.0","Difficult camera to use...","I purchased the Nikon L100 as a replacement for an older Cannon PowerShot, and am thorughly dissapointed. Having shot professionaly with Nikon cameras for several years, I did not hesitate to trust the brand...that was a mistake.I'll run through the most obvious issues that I've been frustrated by:'Easy Auto' mode focuses very poorly when using the zoom.Way too many preset modes that only work well under very particular conditions. By the time that I switch to the mode that is most appropriate, I have often missed the moment.Extremely poor color balancing unless you find just the right preset mode for the conditions.little to no ability to set the camera manualy.My camera shipped without the abillity to use rechargable AA batteries. A firmware update can be downloaded from the nikon website, but requires a bit of technical know-how to install...and time which I never have enough of.We have taken some great pictures with this camera, but have missed many more than we would have with the old Cannon. I'll be sure to shop more carefuly when we get so sick of this camera that we can't take it anymore!""
"20091127","3.0","disappointed","I wanted a camera that gave me great close up images. That is why I searched for a 15x zoom. I read people's reviews and many were very pleased with the camera as a whole. So I plunked down the nearly two hundred bucks for it. When I got home and excitedly began shooting pix, the pix looked horrible. Everything I took in the zoom mode was blurry. The pix weren't crisp and clear, and everything seems to have a yellow tinge to it. Plus, the time between pressing the shutter button to when it actually takes the pic is too long. By the time the pic is taken, the people or animals have already moved and your picture is crap. I can't figure out what planet these people are from who gave this a good rating, because I am totally bummed about it. I bought mine at Target, so I'm stuck with it. Buyer beware!""

It's sturdy, reliable and takes amazing photos.  The scene choices give you options for every possible scenario making it easy to take great pics.  I really like the easy auto mode, as it will gauge the environment and choose a scene for you if necessary.The flash is manual - which I love - so you can get authentic light shots or flip up the flash if you need it.  The control buttons next to the LCD screen are similar to other Nikons I've had, making it easy to pick this up and go without much thought.All it all - great camera, great value.

"20091102","1.0","Nikon CoolPix L100 makes Bad photos","I can't recommend purchasing the Nikon CoolPix L100, - not even to my worst enemy.  Especially not a good camera for any one time moments. You will be taking a dice roll with every shot, not a photograph. Too bad, it's a nice looking camera, nice lens, just junk internal works and cheap firmware apparently. Having owned and used the old reliable Nikon FG 35mm SLR (non-digital) for many years, and also a Nikon 'One Touch' Zoom 90 (Digital 'point and shoot'); I was really disappointed with the dismal image quality of the CoolPix L100. Nikon really has drastically lowered the quality of their products, if this is any example. I couldn't produce many decent photos indoors or out, most were not even close.  Almost every single photo was either blurred, extremely grainy, or washed out, etc...and, Yes, that's both with or without the flash. Mostly, the photos were just plain out of focus. I read the manual, tried various and multiple different settings, then buckled down and methodically tried almost every setting in a massive effort to get one single halfway decent 'near' closeup facial shot, but all for naught. So, I went to the store, got some film and took shots with my Zoom 90 just to get a few focused quality shots. Needless to say, I am sending the CoolPix L100 back immediately.  Thanks goes to Amazon for their return policy. The sad part is, - I paid nearly $25.00, which is unrecoverable, to have this junker delivered the next day. Apparently, there's a lot of junk cameras out there nowadays, no matter whose name is on it, so buyers beware. After a lot of research, I'm now going for the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35, 12.1 Megapixel Digital Camera (Black),...wish me luck!""
"20091102","4.0","Really good point and shoot camera","If you are the type to set a camera to Auto, or on one of the presets like landscape, this is a really good camera. However, this camera is lacking a shutter priority mode and also an aperture priority mode that other point and shoots have.The 15x zoom is helpful, but it is a wide angle zoom as opposed to a telephoto zoom. This can cause distortions by making foreground items much larger and distant items seem smaller. In most situations the zoom is real helpful, but it can be a problem in large vista landscape shots.All in all this is a good camera, but I wish I had found the Coolpix P90 before buying. It would have served me better.""
"20091025","5.0","Well worth the wait and research!","I am an amateur when it comes to photography, but my last Canon started producing fuzzy shots and the images were unable to print in a 4x6 without looking awful.  I am fairly hard pressed to spend the amount of money I did on a camera, so I wanted to make sure I was getting what I would pay for.  I researched for a couple of weeks finding out what went into a good camera and how to make the best of a camera I would end up purchasing.  I went into stores, talked with sales clerks, friends, family, co-workers and just about anyone I came across who liked taking pictures.  I read countless reviews, both pros and cons.  I looked hard at the cons of each camera.  Finally it boiled down to the L100.  I read some reviews of the camera not taking very good pictures or coming out fuzzy.  I have not had any trouble with this camera.I did find that buying a decent memory card made a difference in how quickly the camera can store the picture. Some complaints were made about it being a AA battery charged camera - my opinion - I'm glad I'm not worried that I didn't charge my camera the night before, or worry about it then.  I just pack some extra batteries and I'm on my way.I have taken my camera on nature walks and drug my dog along with me.  This camera produced such amazing, vivid pictures that even my family was impressed.Believe me I was skeptical, but I have found this camera to be a great, amateur camera for those who love taking good pictures.  It has been a wonderful learning tool.  READ THE MANUAL - I'm a visual learner, but I have found this manual to be extensive and very helpful.So for the price, fast shipping by Amazon, quality pictures I have taken - do I regret anything? Absolutely not.  I am so happy with my choice, and so impressed with this piece of technology.As far as the couple four stars I gave it - only in good conscience could I say that I did not absolutely love it because really, it is no SLR.  Still, it is awesome.""

The photos are blurry!  What's the use of having 10 megapixels if the shot is out of focus?I tried different settings - outside, inside, close up, zoom.  Only an average of one out of every 20 shots was clear (barely).Not the quality I expect from a brand like Nikon.""
"20091014","4.0","Very Nice Camera","I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who wants to take good pictures, but not pony-up for an SLR camera. It is very easy to use, though it takes some time playing with the settings to get it right. I don't like the 'Easy Auto Mode'. I don't find it very 'easy', just not very useful and usually a bit blurry. Initially, I was a little worried by that because it was the default and first setting I tried. Don't get discouraged by this. Pick an appropriate setting (portrait or landscape usually work for most things), and don't make it more complicated than it needs to be. The sports continuous setting is amazing. It will shoot 30+ pictures in sucession to make sure you get the best action shot. Used this at a football game and it was awesome. I wouldn't suggest doing this a lot, because you'll have to go through and delete the other shots you don't want later, but it's a cool feature. The panarama assist is pretty good too. This camera shoots pretty good video in a pinch also. Obviously, it is not set up to be your primary video camera, but we used it at a show and was great.""
"20091010","5.0","love it!","I bought this Nikon a few months ago & love it so far! I'm by no means a professional photographer, but I do take TONS of pictures. This is my 3rd digital camera. First was a Canon that I had some major problems with after less than 2 years, had to send it off to be fixed then it broke again & I finally ended up buying a Sony. I've had the Sony about 2.5 years & have had no problems w/ it. I still like it for every day stuff (it's small & fits in my purse), but I really wanted a camera w/ more zoom & this Nikon is perfect.I went to Hawaii shortly after I bought the camera & it's very easy to use. I learned all the features quickly w/out reading the manual. I took it everywhere, took about 500 pics & they all came out great. My friend who lives there loved it & says it's better than her SLR. I got some wonderful pics of her kids on the beach using the 'beach' setting. I also got great sunset pics w/ the 'sunset & dusk/dawn' settings. The indoor pictures turn out great as well...the color is very nice.The camera is not heavy, very comfortable to wear around your neck w/ the strap. I wish it would've come w/ a case, couldn't even find one through Nikon. I ended up buying a Sony case from Walmart & it fits perfectly.This is a great camera for someone who wants something a little more professional than a point & shoot, but doesn't want the price or size of a SLR. When my friends see the lens on this thing, they think it's really expensive & cannot believe I got it at Amazon for just over $200. Amazon definitely has the best price since you don't pay shipping or tax. I did a lot of research & couldn't decide what brand is best...I think you never really know what can happen w/ electronics. But I love this Nikon & would definitely recommend it.""

I bought this camera for my wife and it was so good I bought one for my grandson who is into taking pictures.  My wife loves it and my grandson really loves it.  It is a little big for a point and shoot camera but well worth the bother of a slightly larger camera than say a smaller Coolpix.  My wife had a small Coolpix but since she picked up the L100 she has not touched the smaller camera.  Also the L100 takes regular batteries that last a long time and they are cheap and readily available.  I was not in a hurry to buy a camera so I watched the ads for about 3 weeks and saved a lot of money.""

Some were not -- because I moved. I like the clarity and color of the pictures for nearly everything.

I'm not super camera savvy and this camera is easy for me to navigate. The menu and options are easy to use. I do have a couple complaints. I think it's nuts that you HAVE to take the lense cap off to even turn on the camera. Which means you have to take off the lense cap even if your not taking pictures and just wanted to view them. I've also had a little bit of problems taking indoor photographs. After many trial pictures I think I've got it figured out, but the quality isn't as good as outdoors. For the most part the auto mode works with what i'm using it for, but every once in a while I'll have to change the setting or brightness to get the picture to turn out. But over all I'm extremely happy with it, it's a major step up from my last camera and is a very easy point and shoot camera. It makes me feel like i'm a better photographer than I really am!""

I had trouble with the different settings and even had trouble lifting the flash.  Then one day I was out and my 19 year old daughter grabbed it and took some of the most amazing pictures.  She is quite proficient with Nikon as she has a Nikon DSLR as well as a small Nikon point and shoot that she keeps in her purse at all times.  I realized then that the problem was not the camera but me.  After some practice I was much better at taking pictures and I love many features about the camera.  The zoom is incredible.  I love it.  I got great pictures of hummingbirds and cardinals close up.The flash is great as you have to raise it to take a flash picture.  At first I did not like that but now I do.  It gives me more control.  I love the camera and am still learning.The one thing I do not like is that the batteries are not rechargeable.  I keep the AA batteries in my purse so it does not go dead.  So far I have not had to change them and I have had the camera for about 6 weeks but I feel nervous about it.  I would have preferred to re-charge as I have always done with my digital cameras.In summary, great camera for the money.""

It takes an almost immediate picture---very minimal shutter delay and it has a huge variety of settings as well as a great auto setting.  The zoom is great.  It's very versatile.  I would highly recommend this camera for beginners as well as advanced photographers---if just for the convenience.""
"20090902","4.0","Not bad for the cost","Overall, the Nikon L100 is a good camera.  We have always used Nikon and have been happy with the results.  The pop-up flash does not pop-up automatically.  If you don't remember to do it yourself, pictures come out too dark.  Using Picasa or PhotoShop is necessary for proper lighting.  The camera is used mostly by my wife as she wanted the feature of continuous snapping pics of grandkids and activities. The camera is too bulky for my likes as I use the L-8. I write and shoot pics for a local daily newspaper. No case with the camera unless purchased extra.  Overall, an 8 out of 10 pts.""
"20090827","4.0","EASY TO USE. Recommend!!  Like it VERY MUCH!","Recently bought this camera and obviously hasn't had time to have issues but what a neat camera. Definitely for the family. Wouldn't recommend for professional use.  I was amazed at some of the detail I have been missing from my 3x optical.  I have never owned a camera that took great night shots but this one did. In auto mode taking a night shot of a city with lights without changing any modes I had the best picture I have ever took. I decided right there I wasn't taking it back. From 75 yards took a great street night picture. I caught a hummingbird in flight.  Took a few tries but I got some keepers.  I have kids in sports and it has the sport mode.  You can NOT zoom with the movie mode (fyi). It supports 4 alkaline and or Lithium. Mine also has some other battery support but does not take normal rechargeables. You can use SD and SDHC.  I have played with all cameras before purchasing and I really wanted to purchase the canon sx110 but couldn't do it for the same money. Played with both in the stores and the canon felt cheap, and had many in store blurred pictures. I didn't have that with this. I was thinking about buying a camera until I checked this one out and had to bring it home. Has a large lcd screen. By the way NO VIEW FINDER. BUT> I don't remember the last time I used one since I went digital anyway.  I think it could be the perfect family camera. A little bulky but you have a zoom. I'll trade one for the other. The controls are super easy to use and I can work them without even looking. Hope I get many years from this purchase and I don't steer you all wrong.  Happy Shopping.""
"20090817","4.0","Nikon L100 great but could be better","I just recieved this item yesterday and took hundreds of pics after reading the manual. This camera takes awesome pics of still objects and is relatively easy to use. I only hate one thing; I can not for the life of me, take great picture of people with this camera. I tried every setting and I can only get descent pic out of it (blury). I think an expensive brand such as this one would be able to focus to indoor pictures better than this has. Getting familiar with the functions will allow you take great pictures, but good luck on people pics. I will go with a Canon instead. Amazon is great about refunding products and I will take a $6.75 hit on the return.""
"20090816","5.0","Great camera for the average photographer","Style: This camera has a nice weight to it and it fits perfectly in my hand.  I looked at several other cameras in the $200-400 range and this Nikon was a perfect fit.Image:So far pictures are clear even with the zoom fully extended.  The image stabilization works well and the continuous shot feature is a blast.  I took pictures of my dog and caught so much with the camera that I didn't see him doing with my naked eye.Features: There are many scenes to choose from, but if you want the most control use the auto feature where you can adjust exposure, etc.  There are many features to help you take the perfect shot, so I would suggest reading the manual fully before taking pictures of any important events.All in all, I am very pleased with the camera.

The photos are blurry.""
"20090711","4.0","Very Easy Camera","I bought my Coolpix L100 about a month ago, before now I was a devoted Canon Powershot owner but the newer powershots are either too expensive, or too stupid.  The L100 was the right price and seemed simple enough for me to try.First, what I don't like:  No viewfinder, so if you break the LCD the camera is useless.  However, it was a chance I was willing to take since the price was low enough.  Second, it will only take movies for 25 minutes, then you will need to start up a new movie.  Usually my movies are less than that time anyway, but still I don't see a reason to limit the movie time if your SD card can handle a longer movie time.  Your battery life will be VERY low, once again because of the only LCD option, and you are not supposed to use rechargeable batteries.  so get used to buying a lot of double A's.Now what I do like:  It takes wonderful pictures, very warm, and is by far the simplest camera to use.  If you want a camera that lets you to adjust speed/light/etc then buy THAT type of camera, don't buy the simple ones for people that just want to take pictures.  This, is set up so even a child can take a good picture.  Back Light option takes great pictures of people in front of windows, Macro takes great close up, etc.  Zoom is awesome, although it doesn't work nearly as well when you are shooting a movie.So, for the money, definately a good purchase.  For a bit more money I would have liked a viewfinder, more movie time and more zoom capability while shooting in movie mode, other than that it's a wonderful camera.""
"20090710","3.0","Nice Spare Camera","This is a rather simple little camera. The photographs it produces are of decent quality and can be edited for a website or poster. It doesn't do particularly well on action shots, though.It runs on four AA batteries, which I see as a demerit, but apparently there are people who like cameras that run on alkalines.The main screw up that happened with this camera was when I flipped it on one day and found that every single photo, even the locked ones, on the memory card had somehow been deleted. I most definitely did not delete them myself, and the memory card had not been tampered with. I would be much more upset about this if I hadn't downloaded the photos to my computer the night before (no, the computer didn't delete them: they were still there when I checked after the downloading).It's a good spare camera, and nothing more.""
"20090704","3.0","A decent camera for a budget","I got this camera as a gift and chose it myself. I was looking at purchasing a Kodak Z1015 iS, but could not find a place where I could actually get my hands on it. This camera was purchased to replace a FANTASTIC, but old and slowly dying Kodak DX 7630.While the camera takes very sharply focused pictures when they are in focus, I am having trouble finding the sweet spot. The colors (especially reds and oranges) are overly saturated and I usually have to edit them by hand. The flash is WAY TOO BRIGHT and I am considering taping some tissue over it to tone it down since I have not found a way to change the brightness in the menu. The buttons are very sensitive and I am constantly hitting them on accident whilst holding the camera.Any average tech savvy person can operate this camera right out of the box. It is very easy to use. I have played with most of the Auto and Manual settings and am pleased for the most part.I still would have liked to get  that Kodak in my hands....still trying to decide if I am going to return this L100.""

"20090623","5.0","Wow","I bought the L100 because of: 1)the 15 x zoom;  2)the NIKON brand; 3)the price - under $200.It has been 4 days since I got it. I am very VERY happy about this camera.Most pictures I took were around the house Indoor, out of window) because of the rain(3 days). The picture quality is really awesome. I tried different modes, like auto, museum, portrait, close-up, foods,the pictures are all sharp. The camera seems adjusting to the dim light very well as I haven't used the flash,not even once yet. Its powerful zoom captures everything within 80 feet with fine detail. I am most impressed by the close-up shots I took. They have the looks of pro's work (I am not). Even though L100 is technically labeled a point-n-shoot because of its lack of manual controls,its pictures have the sophistication similar to other high-end SLP cameras.Most point-n-shoot cameras basically just copy what you see. This Nikon, through it lens or technology, give you something different from what your naked eyes register, like the waterdrops on a leaf. If you just want to record life for memory, most PnS would do a decent enough job. If you want to move up to another level, awakening your inner artistic talent with some impressive photos, this is the perfect tool. And the price is almost irresistable.""

This camera takes the most amazing pictures, great zoom, focus, and brings out amazing light in every shot. I couldn't be happier.""
"20090617","5.0","It DOES use a rechargeable battery!","I thought I would emphasize the rechargeable battery since Nikon just added it recently and some reviewers were saying the L100 couldn't use a rechargeable battery. It's a NI-MH battery with recharger. Check the NIKON webpage for the L100 and you will see it listed under 'optional accessories'. Personally, I don't like rechargeables because they lose their charge over time and you have to remember to recharge them when you get ready to use your camera. I'd much rather just pop in a set of alkaline AA's. Then battery cost is about a penny a pic. I can afford that.Here are the reasons I bought this camera. I use it to do stop-motion shooting in the woods using toy action figures, also on a copy stand to copy greaseboard drawings for animation, and just for general photo shooting. This camera helps because:(1) It has a flat bottom and with a triangular footprint which means it will not fall over when you set it down. No tripod needed. I put a flat piece of wood between it and the ground to protect it.(2) The 15X Zoom lens widens all the way out to 5mm which is equivalent to a 28mm lens on a 35mm camera. Most digicams only go down to about 6mm or 5.7mm on the wide end. (The 75mm telephoto end of the zoom is about as powerful as you can have and still keep steady with a handheld shot. This camera has a double system of vibration control to help avoid blurred shots.)(3) The scene modes include one called 'Food' mode which is very useful to me. It automatically switches to macro close-up lens and puts control of color balance on the arrow buttons where you can easily adjust it. Then, whatever color balance you set stays in memory (just for the Food mode) until the next time you use Food mode, even if you turn the power off. That's important for stop motion because you don't want the camera automatically resetting the color balance for each shot. Obviously the Food mode is intended for close-up shooting of food, but it works for me and my toys!(4) There is an AC adapter for the camera, which I have ordered, so I will not be using any batteries for my in-the-studio shooting.(5) NIKON quality. I tried this camera in the store and couldn't even hear the zoom operate. By contrast, a similar-priced CANON made a distinct grinding noise. The quality even extends to the 4 manuals - a 134 page main manual in English, a 20 page Quickstart manual in English, and then both manuals completely duplicated in Spanish as well. The manuals cover every feature in clear detail. It took me 2 hours to learn the camera features to my own satisfaction, BUT, there is an 'EASY AUTO' mode that requires you to know nothing from the manual other than how to push a shutter button. Of course, maybe you should buy a simpler camera if that's all you want from your camera, but with the 'EASY AUTO' mode you can share this camera with all family members, even the ones who don't want to know what color balance is.(6) Maybe I am thinking illogically, but I believe that a big lens takes better pictures than a little lens... and this camera has a BIG lens. That means you can't slip it in your pocket, but I have a nifty little belt-loop case (the Edit 100) that neatly fits the camera and has pockets for 2 sets of 4 AA batteries and room for the SD memory card's case and maybe a few more small items.To sum it up, the quality is high, the price is low, and it takes great pictures in a variety of situations with an easy-ro-use operating system. If you want more than that, then get a reflex camera and pretend you're a pro. :)""

After reading the first review on this Nikon though, and doing extensive research online on both the Canon SX10IS and the Nikon Coolpix L100, I decided to go with the cheaper Nikon.  I had it for a total of 2 hours and it went back in the box and back to Amazon for a refund.  There are no manual adjustments on the camera and this is especially important when the ISO is automatically setting itself to +700 outside!  Every picture we took, inside and out, (and yes, we are avid camera users and did read the manual...briefly) was super grainy and the ISO and shutter speed was way out of whack.  We sent the camera back and are going to stick with Canon from now on.""
"20090517","4.0","Great camera for long-distance shots!","I primarily purchased this camera because I love my smaller Nikon Coolpix 7600 but wanted something with more zoom.  I've only had this camera for about a week, but its great so far!I do see the 'focusing problem' someone was talking about, but its not really a problem...Its just that you can't zoom in too closely on something if you are standing close to it - I think this is because of the lens type - its for long distances.  But if you choose the macro setting specifically for close-ups, this can also be avoided.When I first got the camera and took it out of the box, I immediately started taking pictures and they weren't coming out so good, but this was because I didn't know how to make the flash work - you have to raise it by hand - a quick check of the manual revealed this, but I was too anxious in the beginning to stop and read the manual. ;-)Also, I had trouble getting used to choosing the different scene settings becuase it doesn't have a dial like my old Coolpix did.  Then I realized this is a GOOD thing, because the dial would constantly get turned when I didn't realize it and be on the wrong setting when I took a picture.If you are an expert photographer and want the control of an SLR, this is not something you will like, but for amateurs or people who just want more zoom than a small camera offers - this is a really good choice.  It is not as bulky as an SLR and you don't have to worry about changing lenses.Be aware that the manual says this camera cannot be used with rechargable batteries.""

Well, the 3'' LCD is truly great--I was taking pictures at the beach, in the middle of the day, and still was able to see the screen. I was also concerned about having to raise the flash manually, since I am not a pro at all. I realized that being able to do that is actually a great advantage for every day pictures. It makes a huge difference when taking pictures inside. I had problems with flash going off automatically with my Sony Cybershots, and now I see the difference.Make sure to get a big enough camera bag.""
"20090514","1.0","Its got the focussing problem","I got very excited when I purchased this camera thinking that it could be a great replacement for a point and shoot type cameras and also to have a feeling like SLR.

So I went to best buy and fooled around with the same model camera out there on display. It was working perfectly fine with very very fast capturing and dead silent. I tried to take an image for the tiny screw on my eye glasses frame and it took a crystal clear picture in no time. So I concluded definitely the piece I got is defective. Amazon is great but I was hesitant to take a replacement option becuase the whole lot they have could be bad ones. But thank you Amazon for giving me the credit on returns.

Can I or can I not use the rechargeable batteries that are being sold with this camera?""
"20090330","5.0","L100 - Great Camera All Around, Especially for Beginners","After extensive research on advanced point-and-shoots that use AA batteries (something I require), I settled on three: the Nikon L100, the Canon Powershot SX10IS, and the Fujifilm s8100fd. So you know the perspective from which this review is coming, I'm not an experienced photographer but I'm not clueless either.  However, this is my first camera more advanced than a basic point-and-shoot.  So I'll call myself an informed beginner.This is why I chose the L100:COST: The L100 is significantly less expensive than the SX10IS.  The s8100fd's price was comparable to the L100, but I felt that the technology on the L100 was better.  Amazon had the best price I could find (besides some sketchy online sellers).TECHNOLOGY:  This was a toughy.  All three of these cameras have comparable technology (image stabilization, zoom, megapixels, face recognition, scene modes, etc. etc.) and each has one or two unique features that I found very attractive.  So this variable was not a deal maker or breaker for me.  But when it came down to it, the L100 is the most beginner-friendly of the three cameras.  The Auto Modes do literally everything for you: the camera chooses the shutter speed, ISO, aperture, no flash or one of a number of flash modes, AND scene mode, which neither of the other cameras do.  So from bright- to low- light situations and from various distances, it will automatically adjust more aspects of the shot than will the other cameras.  This, I think, would be especially attractive to the minimally experienced photographer who just wants to click the button wherever they are and come out with great pictures.WEIGHT AND SIZE: I handled a Canon Powershot SX10IS at the store and it was just too heavy for my liking (a common complaint, from what I've read).  The L100 is very lightweight. Although the s8100fd is of similar weight, the L100 is slightly smaller in size, which I like.LARGER SCREEN: The 3 inch LCD is bigger than the screens on the other cameras, it's very bright, and it has a coating that reduces glare.After playing around with the camera for a few days, here are some additional observations/impressions:MENU: The menu is very user-friendly and easily navigable.  No problems there. Take ten minutes to read through the manual so you are aware of all the menu options.DESIGN AND FEEL: It's not a slippery camera, which seems to be a complaint with some of the comparable cameras I've read reviews about.  The buttons seem intuitively placed to me, and the camera feels balanced in my hand.IMAGE STABILIZATION: This works very well.  As long as you are in the right mode (read the manual for descriptions of situations you should choose the modes yourself) the camera takes completely focused and clear pictures, even with an unsteady hand.BATTERIES and MEMORY CARD: The battery life on this camera is good: 900 shots with Li-Ion batteries.  Some people don't like the SD card to be accessible in the same door as the batteries (like it is with this camera), but I don't find a problem with it.  I bought an Ultra II SDHC card for the camera and it processes the pictures very quickly.MOVIE MODE: You can zoom 2x while shooting video, which is nice.OTHER FEATURES I LIKED:  The Best Shot Selector is a unique feature that I like.  It's just another one of those very beginner-friendly features of this camera that will allow you to take great shots without having to do a lot. The Sports continuous-shooting mode (shooting 13 frames per second) also works well for action shots.TAKING PICTURES: Like I mentioned before, I'm not an experienced photographer.  But I found that out of the box in the 'Easy-Auto' Mode, this camera takes focused, sharp, professional-looking pictures. As I started to play around with other features, I became even more impressed with the quality of the pictures in a variety of lighting, distance, and movement situations.  The High ISO mode captures movement VERY well! I first tested it by waving my arm in the mirror as fast as I could and taking pictures, and the camera captured perfectly focused and crisp pictures of me. This is the first camera I've ever used that actually captures excellent movement shots.  Even at maximum zoom, the shots are focused and look great. The flash is extremely bright, although I find I rarely need to use it.The only complaint that I have at this point is that the camera has trouble focusing on objects in dim light, including close objects in Macro Mode. However, from the dozens of reviews I've read on other comparable cameras, this seems to be a common problem.  It's also possible that I haven't played around with the camera enough to know how to circumvent the problem, but I still was a little disappointed.OVERALL:  This camera is inexpensive for it's class, lightweight, has the latest technology, and is extremely beginner- and user-friendly. It is the perfect camera for someone who wants something more than a basic point-and-shoot but doesn't want to spend the money on an SLR or the energy trying to figure out a more complex camera to get great shots. For those beginner to moderately skilled photographers debating between an advanced point-and-shoot and a SLR (like I initially did), you will be glad you got this over an expensive and bulky SLR.  A SLR with a 15x+ telephoto lens will cost 3-4 times as much as this camera, and I'm very pleased with the quality of the photos I'm getting with the L100.  The Easy-Auto and Auto modes are excellent and I think most people will be very happy with the shots they will produce while in them, even if they never leave those modes. However, learning all of the features is easy and hasn't taken me that long, and my pictures have looked more and more professional the more I've played around with them. This is a great camera.PS-I got the M-Rock Ozark 505 case for this camera and it fits it perfectly----------------------------Here is a video collage of pictures I took with this camera in Namibia - [...]""

I've read a few reviews complaining about blurry pictures and I know what they're talking about. For me this mostly occurs in the Auto mode or many of the other still modes which is why I almost always use the Sports/Continuous mode. I will hold the button and take several continuous shots to ensure I get a good frame. It takes time sorting out and deleting some bad shots but oh well. I've gotten some really nice pictures from pro hockey games, concerts, ceremonies and parties where there is alot of movement. I haven't read the manual inside and out but I am also having a hard time getting night pictures or dark indoor pictures like concerts to turn out so far.""
"20110613","3.0","Fragile!","I loved this camera when I bought it. However, after a few months, the flash stopped working and the zoom also. The plastic cap came loose. I was able to fix the zoom, but not the flash. It needs to be more durable!""

When I just bought it, I liked the zoom and wide angle, but I found the poor quality of indoor picture, it is much worse than my very old canon card digital camera. Even the outdoor pictures are not good either when compared with the sony card camera of my girlfriend. I do not know why nikkon produce such product. I keeps me away from nikkon's other products when I think about this camera.""

Wow, was I in disappointed! My husband actually did a lot of research before we bought it for Christmas and it seemed to get great reviews. But, despite the 'Great/Good' reviews, we have not been happy with the Nikon L110 at all. The quality of pictures are awful! Very blurry and the color quality is not vibrant at all. I have tried many different modes and changed this and that based on what others have written, but with no success! Now, I have to spend more money for a better camera. I would not buy this camera if you want to have crisp and visible pictures for you lasting memories!Thinking back, I think this is the first Negative review on a product I have ever posted. That tells you how strong I feel about this product.""
"20110420","2.0","Way too frustrated to be impressed.","I can honestly say I hate this camera. I couldn't tell you how many times I've wanted to throw it out of sheer frustration. Don't get me wrong, the L100 IS capable of producing beautiful, high quality photos, but they are so few and far between that it's not even worth it. I think Nikon should have spent alot less time making a convenient camera that does everything for you (including asking if the person blinked- really??) and worked more on creating a better camera. If the photo isn't taken at the exact millisecond of perfection then you just get a crap, semi clear photo. Outdoors is the best way to get good lighting, all the indoor lighting features over expose the color and the photos always need to be adjusted with software because they come out either too green or too warm- especially the indoor night shots. There is no viewfinder, which I understand isn't necessary with digital but it can still come in handy. You also cannot select the shutter speed- the camera determines that on it's own which can also ruin a good photo opportunity. And God forbid the object moves within the 1.5 seconds in which you push the shutter button and the camera auto focuses to take the picture. The hi ISO feature is a joke because it only allows you to use up to 3mega pixels so I'm always debating on whether to use the other menu options with the higher mp in order to get better clarity (but in the end get the wrong lighting) or use the lower  mp, get the desired lighting but have a photo full of noise. I think Nikon really missed the boat on this one. And of course you realize the photo is no good only after it's been taken and you've either lost the opportunity altogether or you have to fiddle with the dozens of menu photo options and select a different one with the hopes it will come out better the second (or third, or fourth) time around. The user is extremely limited and hardly able to take photos to their fullest potential because the camera determines way to much for its own good. If that's your cup of tea, then by all means go for it but chances are you will only achieve several nice, mediocre photos and only a couple excellent ones. In my opinion if you are a novice photographer save a hundred bucks and get a cheaper camera that can take just as decent of a photo as this one and if you are an experienced photographer spend the extra money and get a digital SLR (or heck, use the 'ol 35mm film SLR) instead. It's really not worth the time and frustration.""
"20110307","1.0","Buying a different camera","Today I purchased a Panasonic Lumix after a year and a half of frustration and disappointment using the Nikon Coolpix L100.  Not having an eye piece viewfinder is a BIG mistake as the sun reflects your own image off the monitor. Zoom in with the 15X lens and it is a guess if you are still on your subject using the monitor.  The viewfinder does not show the 'refocus' using the image stabilization feature so another guess if the picture is going to turn out or not.  I gave up on this camera.""

"20110110","3.0","Good, but missing something...","I like this camera. But when I was shopping for a new camera, I missed a few important details when I chose this one.  It doesn't have a view finder. So, when it's very bright outside, I almost have to take the picture blindly.  It would be nice if, on bright days, I could use a view finder to take the picture.  Also, my last camera housed the SD card in a separate compartment from the batteries.  This camera has the SD slot and batteries in the same compartment.  This is difficult if you need to switch SD cards because you have to be careful not to dump the batteries.  The last problem with the camera is minor, but annoying.  The lens cap MUST be removed before you turn on the camera.  It will not let you continue use if you turn it on while the lens cap is on.  VERY annoying.  This also means if you have your camera hooked up to your computer to download pictures, you have to remove the lens cap even if you're not even taking pictures.  ANNOYING!!Other than those negatives, it's basically a good camera.""
"20110101","1.0","coffeefor3","Don't waste your money on this! I have had this camera for 1 year, (got it for last year's xmas pictures).  When I first received the camera, I loved it...after a couple of months, it's quality faltered and now its worthless!  (Yes, I know how to operate it, read the book, took photo in collage). Indoor pictures are ALWAYS yellow no matter what setting you put it on and most are fuzzy.  The Macro feature will not focus, the auto smile feature never really worked, and it now freezes up and has to have batteries removed to work again.  When I firt got the camera, the smile feature would reconize about 2 people at a time, (never 12 or whatever it clames to do), and now it will put a box around one person and no auto picture when they smile.  It will tell you when someone has their eyes closed which is nice, unless the person wears glasses and then it always tells you there closed. Was hoping this camera would be fast enough to capture kids at play, but they are always fuzzy. Not sure why the quality of the camera went down hill so fast, keep in case, never drop, but it is worthless now.  Only good out of it is the zoom, very good, if outside.""
"20101213","5.0","The Great Outdoors with Nikon Coolpix L100","I have not used this camera extensively yet, however I have a few remarks.  I am a non-professional recreational photographer primarily shooting outdoors.  Nature scenes and landscapes.This camera was attractive because of its relatively light-weight and the 15X zoom for wildlife photography.  I have not used it yet for these purposes, so I intend to report back later on my experiences.What I can tell is this camera is very straight-forward to use.  The Easy-Shot mode will have most point and shoot photographers (like me) up and running quickly.  Easy to handle, has a nice feel.  The display is well designed, I haven't use it outside in daylight yet so not sure how well it handles glare.  Lot's of features for a reasonable price.  Works like a point-and-shoot digital with a little of the feel of a SLR.This camera works with NiMH rechargeable batteries if you desire.  One tip- after first installation of the NiMH batteries you change the battery selection (to NiMH), your battery meter will appear to be low.  Just turn off the camera and back on again, the low battery indication should disappear (if the batteries are fully charged).""

"20101023","3.0","LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP -  CASUAL PICTURE TAKERS CAN GET THE NIKON L110 CHEAPER","You can get the improved Model L110 for a lower price.  It uses the same lens but has a 12MegaPixel sensor instead of 10.  Also, the image stabilizer is noticeably improved.  But I wouldn't recommend buying ether camera.  Both produce sharp images only in bright light where you get smaller lens opening (but larger numbered) f-stop settings.  The image quality is very poor if the lighting is much darker than a well lit store.  Also, they both lack direct user controls of ISO (light measurement method set by the International Organization of Standardization).  Neither camera is good in low light.  Results are fuzzy and grainy.###-SAME DAY UPDATE-###I'm changing my rating from ONE STAR to THREE STARS.  While all I have written above is true, the L100 does work well in ideal conditions.  And it does contain some miracles of our times. I think the lens is a bit too soft.  But the reason I don't rate it higher is because the L100 is way behind the competition.  (Checkout canon's line of small cameras.  The newer ones can be a bit pricey but they are a lot better than this Nikon.)I bought a Nikon L100 because of its size, portability, appearance, easy macro ability, and the extreme telephoto.  I didn't plan to reduce the use of my Single Lens Reflex (Canon Rebel 450D,T2i).  I just wanted a small camera only for some macro shots - and some long telephoto shots - with a camera that wont weigh me down.  The nearby discount store offered the L100 for $199.99.  At the time I thought that was a great price.  I trusted the Nikon brand name.  I should have checked the Internet reviews before buying any kind of camera.  I'm disappointed; but I can still get some use from this camera.  I'm not taking it back.While I want to agree with the ONE STAR reviewers, they must all be very serious amateurs.  No professional photographer would use such a camera - not in 2010.None the less, I now think that THREE STARS is more fair.  The L100 isn't really too awfully bad.  And the L110 is probably better.  Both are made for beginners and casual picture takers.  Such people might actually love the newer and lower priced Nikon 110.  It can take pictures that would have been impossible with a consumer digital camera ten years ago.  Yes, if this were the year 1900, I would give both cameras FOUR STARS.""

This camera will either be your best friend or your worst enemy depending on what your needs are.  A large LCD screen, easy to use controls, and an AMAZING 15x zoom will make your pictures turn out great if you want to use them for a family album.  If you are looking to get anything out of this camera besides family album pictures, you will be highly disappointed.  When enlarged (even on the 10mp mode) say to hang on a wall, etc. your pictures will look grainy beyond belief.  This won't be a problem for most people though.  Another negative is the bulky size of this camera...you have to make sacrifices though to get 15x zoom.

I have few good pictures to show for this camera.  Also, it goes into power-save mode way too quickly and then by the time it wakes up, you've missed your shot.

I just got back from the first trip I took the little Nikon on and let me say, it was a pleasure.  This is a really, really easy camera to use.  Can you adjust shutter speed?  Nope. Can just adjust aperture?  Um, what's that mean?  So that's a no.  Know what else?  Who cares?  This not a professional grade camera.  It's not even prosumer.  It's a Point And Shoot or as a friend of mine used to say 'it's a PHD for push-here-dummy.'  The only thing making it better than any of the other PAS cameras, well besides the fact that it had neither Dora the Explorer nor the Optimus Prime on it, is the lens.  It's got a real lens on it.  I took beach shots, sky shots, macro-shots all at different times of day and night and it preformed beautifully.  There seemed to have been an easy setup for everything I tried to do but if I was trying a particular shot and it just looked terrible, I switched to 'Easy Auto,' and most of the time, it fell right into what I was trying to make it do.  The only thing I wish it had, is a viewfinder.  Sometimes in bright sunlight, that LCD all but disappeared.  Good thing for me, I'm a good shot.  I'm into this (refurbished) camera, an 8Gig SD card and case for less than $200 and it was a great investment.  Want a great camera that's a bit more than a toy but not so complicated you'll never understand 1/2 of what it does?  This is it.

I just have to say that the one day shipping is excellent as well.The things I'm disappointed with on this camera are:1.  When the camera is zoomed all the way out, it will not focus on anything.  What sometimes works is focusing on your subject before zooming out and then once you have it as far out as you like, press the shutter all the way down and not half way down.  Sometimes the camera will try to focus again anyways which will lead to nothing being focused on and sometimes this techniques works great.2.  When trying to take pictures at night, the camera won't flash even if I have the flash up.  It won't let me change the flash setting either even when the picture mode isn't on night shot.3.  There isn't much going on in the menu.  Compared to other simple compact cameras that I have had, this camera has very limited settings to play around with.  The most disappointing setting that this camera is without is an option to take a picture is black and white, sepia tone, etc.  I've always had that option in other cameras.For the things I like about this camera:1.  The zoom is incredible.  If you have a steady hand and are able to get the camera to focus, you can have great pictures of things you can't or don't want to get close to.2.  I've taken some really cool macro shots with this camera.This camera is well worth it's price and is a great camera for those who want more power than a simple point and shoot but can't afford a DSLR.

Overall picture looks good.You need to change the mode when taking picture like if its cloudy just select the matching mode. Selecting a mode is very easy in this camera as compared to others. This camera takes very nice outdoor pictures as compared to the indoor.Zoom is good and powerful. The only disliking problem is that it takes time to charge the flash. Like if you are in a hurry and the scene requires flash it may take a while to charge the flash so the subject can move while the flash is charging.

"20100211","4.0","No Point And Shoot, This","Haven't owned a camera in 30 years.  My last was a Fugi SLR filmcamera which I was getting better with before I moved to Floridawhere it was too hot (for me) to do any darkroom work.  So, I quit.Lately, I began getting interested again...the wildlife I encounter all the time sparked my interest, again.  Really, it was a bald eaglein a dead tree which let me get close enough to get about 8 shotswith my cell phone camera.  None of them were viewable.  Then Istarted carrying around an older Kodak p&s, curtesy of my spouse. Iactually saw the eagle again and got what I thought were some okexposures...Wrong.  No way to tell whether the bird was an eagleor a vulture.  I was unable to get close enough.  So I researcheda bit, knowing I needed some optical telephoto capability.  But I was not going to make a big investment at this stage fo the game.  I've always respected Nikon quality and utility and the L100 fell withinthe range I was willing to spend...just barely.  Unfortunately, Igot it slightly used...$5 more and could have gotten a new one.  ButI got confused in my ordering.  Anyway, the camera and accessorieswere fine...the only problem was that there was no operating manual.After about an hour of trying to figure things out, I gave upand downloaded one from Nikon.  At 148 pages, it was a bit costlywhen I printed it out.  But without it, I could not have donemuch with the camera.Its a good camera.  The shots keep getting better as I get toknow what I'm doing.  Getting proficient is still going to take sometime, however.  It is a rather complex machine, it seems to me.So if one isn't prepared for a somewhat lengthy learning curve or knows digital cameras well, the L100 may be too much bother.  Theonly thing I really hate about it is that it has no viewfinderexcept for the lcd in the back.  Shooting non cooperating wild animals outdoors, in sunny weather can be exasperating...the brightillumination sometimes washing out the lcd image just when I'm ready to hit the shutter button as the sun peeks out from behind a cloudor you have to change your angle.  Since I've never used a camerathat didn't have a viewfinder...except that one time with my wife'sKodak, I just assumed it would have one.  My fault.Its not too big or bulky but certainly not as small and lightweightas most point and shoot models. For me, that's good because I'm lesslikely to forget I have it or put it down somewhere and forget whereI left it...oldtimers disease.  Seems to have a quality build andhas been reliable, so far.So, I'd give it an overall 4 out of 5.  Probably 5 of 5 if it hada viewfinder.""
"20100211","5.0","Great little camera!","I had been wanting a camera for a long time. While I am not a novice, I am also not an expert using settings for a camera. I needed something that would automatically set and be easy to use. I researched for a while before deciding on this one. I am very happy with the way it works and in the way the photos turn out. Nikon has made it easy to be a good photographer with little experience. And it looks so good!!!!""
"20100210","5.0","Exactly as Advertised","I was looking for a new digital camera to replace an older Canon that had failed.  This Nikon is exactly what I was looking for, and I'm completely satisfied with it so far.  It's easy to use and produces excellent photos. I'm sure there are more sophisticated cameras on the market, but this one has more features and abilities than I'll ever need.  I think it's great!""
"20100210","2.0","Good zoom, average to bad pictures","I bought this camera for the strong zoom primarily.  That has not disappointed, the 15x is quite powerful for this price range.  However, I have been disappointed with many of the pictures.  The flash will not engage automatically, so if the situation needs a flash it is up to you to open it.  I would say very few pictures are crisp.  Most are just dull, not bad, not good.  But some are just horrible-out of focus, grainy, dark, etc.""
"20100207","5.0","Great Camera","By no means am I a professional when it comes to photography, but I like pictures that look like more than a snap-shot.  I shopped for a long time to find the right camera.  I needed 2 of them-- one for myself and one for a gift.  In the correct price range and with the right features, I found this camera, a Cannon, a Kodak and a Fuji.  That is to be expected.  The Kodak was way too shaky and took pictures that were either way too dark or way too light.  The Cannon was good, but really didn't have the added features I liked on the Nikon and Fuji.  Also, it did not do well with bright lights.  So, in the end, I got this Nikon for myself.  I let the gift receiver pick her's and she chose the Fuji.  I got to play with both and at first was upset that I got the Nikon.  It seemed like the camera wanted to be smarter than me and choose settings that didn't really fit.  The Fuji didn't.  But... by the end of a vacation and playing with the camera constantly, I am really glad that I choose the Nikon.  I got some really great pictures and 'found' some features that the Fuji just couldn't deliver on.  Moral of the story: Buy the Nikon and play with it before you make a judgement; you'll love it in the end!""

I would do business with them again.""
"20100206","5.0","Cool pics with Coolpix!","Here's a camera that takes pictures like a professional. Different lighting situations, ability to adjust shutters speeds, the possibilities are almost endless. It comes with a generous neck-strap, so there are no worries about putting it down. The viewing screen is great without having to turn it a certain way to see it. The menu is fairly navigable, and the zoom is a breeze to work, leaving more thinking to go to the subject being photographed.""

"20100203","1.0","I used to be a Nikon fan Before this camera","To start off, My ex wife and I bought a Nikon P80, and I really liked that camera. Now on to this camera..... Size was not an Issue for me, but don't expect to put this camera in a pocket. More importantly, the pictures were grainy, the colors were off, and the camera was 100% automatic, so there was no way to adjust the picture quality. The final straw with me, was comparing pictures from my brand new Nikon Coolpix L100 10MP Digital Camera with 15x Optical zoom, to the pictures from my Kodak EasyShare CX7430 4MP Digital Camera with 3x optical zoom, that I bought in Early 2004. The old Kodak was way better than the new nikon!! Anyways, I ended up sending my Nikon L100 back after about 1.5 weeks, and spent a lot more money on a Canon DSLR, less portable, but take great pictures on command.""
"20100203","2.0","CoolPix - Not So Cool: Important Features Lacking","1. The camera does not have a direct viewfinder, relying only on the digital screen. Under the vast number of picture opportunities, the viewing a scene was totally (and I mean totally) useless and the picture taking was just guess work.2. There is no way to preset the aperture opening for changing depth of field. this is really frustrating.3. There is no way to preset the shutter speed which is just as frustrating.If I could, I would return the camera for one that has the above features.Frankly, I was surprised that Nikon would make a camera like this.""
"20100130","1.0","A very awful camera.","You think this is a good camera when you look at its features and it feels like everybody who gave it a bad review just didn't know how to use the camera. I played around with the camera a lot, read the manual, and the picture quality is just always bad no matter what you do. I think my phone camera and the cheapest digital camera can take better photos. Don't waste your money on this camera!""

Above and beyond anything she has ever had before.The image quality isn't perfect, as far as having a HD quality picture (I relate to video work I do), but for a consumer camera, you can't go wrong with it.  Really simple to use, it's small but has a large enough size that it doesn't get lost in your hands.""

I went out and re-took a few pictures thinking I would have them in better quality.  NOT EVEN CLOSE!  This flaming pile of crap overexposed nearly all of them.  I went out and did some comparison shooting between the Canon and this one and the Canon did not overexpose a single shot.  I don't think the shutter speed even exceeds 1000 on this thing.  Also, it is noticeably slower to start up.  The lens quality is slightly better but not at all a redeeming quality.  If you want a decent point-and-shoot go with the Canon.""
"20100125","4.0","Takes good Pix once you understand Scene modes","It's a good long zoom camera that takes decent pix once you figure out what the scene modes do to enhance the picture. Seems to do well in normal indoor lighting situations without the flash.The video is pretty good quality for uploading to FaceBook or YouTube and fairly clear even at a long zoom if you get it focused before you start recording the video. The sports mode works well with multiple pix taken at one time. For the price - it does fine.""

So far she has been very happy with this camera. Her biggest complaint with her last camera was the image stabilization, and she said that is much better with this one.""
"20100119","3.0","A good high-end point and shoot, but battery usage is too high.","We got this camera for our honeymoon after a bit of searching.  Reviews claimed that the image quality was good, and that the 15x zoom was excellent.  Descriptions basically described that as a point and shoot with a decent zoom.  I do not entirely agree with this assesment.In many ways this camera does act like a point and shoot, allowing you to snap pictures of mediocre left and right.  However, the image quality suffers greatly if you are not in the right 'image-mode' for each type of picture.  Example: If you are indoors with low lighting then you better be in 'in-door' mode and have the flash on.  Given there are about 20 or so modes it takes a bit of tinkering to get used to all the settings, taking this camera beyond the simple point and shoot.This said, the camera takes great pictures once you figure it out, and the zoom capabilities are quite impressive.  We took many excellent pictures with this camera after figuring out the basics.  Still, there was one major drawback:  This camera SUCKS batteries dry.  Literally after about an hour of being on this camera requires you to replace the batteries.  Even turning the camera on and off after pictures we barely got 5-6 hours out of it!  Incredible, I know.  Seriously, this is a major detriment, and you should consider it before buying this otherwise good camera.Also of note:  Seems to accept any type of SD card, despite the manual saying it will only take Sandisk.""

"20100117","3.0","Looks Great but it ain't no point and shoot","I read most of the reviews on this camera before I bought it.  Seemed there were some early learning experiances but overall was easy to use and took great pictures.  Well, I have taken 140 shots so far and half of them do not come out clear.  If you are inside, the picture quality is fair at best.  You have to change the mega pixel down to around 4 to get clear inside shots.  If you are going to use the zoom, change the mega pixel down to around 3.  The stabilization does not work all that great either.  I am going to spend another couple of weeks with this thing and if it continues to take all kinds of adjustments to get decent picture I am sending it back.  This thing is alittle more like a SLR when it comes to taking pictures, ain't no point and shoot.""
"20100116","5.0","Great value for the money","If your comfortable with a point & shoot, but your ready to step up, this is the perfect camera for you. Simple to use, right out of the box, yet customizable enough to rival some digital SLR's, at half the size. Excellent image quality, allows for cropping & enlarging with very little pixelation. At under $200, I really didn't think this camera would be everything they said it was. I can honestly say it has exceeded my expectations, and I'm still learning all the features.""
"20100112","5.0","Excellent next-level camera","I wanted a next-level camera from a normal point-and-shoot camera, and the Nikon L100 is great at that.

"20091231","1.0","hate it","Received the camera Dec 14. Set it up, took some shots and did not like it at all.So ..... looked at reviews here, studied the book and took the camera on an 8 dayXmas cruise. Took 102 shots - inside, outside, action, portraits, etc. End result is I still do not like the camera. A few of the portraits are right on but manyshots have a grainy look to them. Out of focus? Perhaps but some are OK and others are not. Why? My previous 8 year old camera was pretty beat up from use but wasconsistent and took crystal clear shots. The L100 is my first Nikon and verydisappointing. I expected much more.""
"20091230","4.0","Pretty good for the price","I am no photography connoisseur so I don't know how helpful this review will be.... But its good value for money.  The screen size is large (something I was looking for), and the lens size is adequate for people who just take photographs on trips etc.  I like the white balance feature, it helps to capture images in proper color in all lighting conditions, so your pictures don't come out looking orangish when you are taking photos indoors at night, for instance at parties and what not.  Flash is powerful.  I also like that it takes AA batteries, so in case you run out of batteries you can always buy some batteries.... though it takes 4 AA batteries.... The 'Easy Auto' mode is pretty good, and in most cases you won't have to worry about tinkering with the settings.... However, its better to know about a few settings and use the camera in the 'Auto' mode instead.  The preloaded settings for portrait/scenary etc etc are also pretty good.  I haven't tested out the image stabilization or the 'best picture' or 'sports' modes either, but I think they will be pretty useful for taking photographs of moving objects.  Overall I am very happy with this camera.""

"20091226","4.0","L100 Does Not Have Fireworks Mode","I bought this camera from Amazon on Thanksgiving evening, on a Black Friday special. I am happy with it, but I do have two complaints.CONS: First, Nikon did not include Fireworks in the mode on this camera.  I called Nikon, and was informed by a representative that the camera DOES have fireworks. She had me go online and right there with my own eyes I saw that Nikon's Tech Specs showed that this camera included Fireworks.  I loved the Fireworks mode on my Nikon Coolpix S550 and took some amazing fireworks photos (using a small tripod).  But the L100's user manual makes no mention of fireworks, and the camera does NOT include fireworks.  Nikon would not call me back, even though the rep elevated the call to Level 2. I then tried contacting them online.  I included a screenshot of the Tech Specs from their site along with asking if there was a way to upgrade the firmware to include fireworks. They closed my case and never contacted me.  Next thing I know, Nikon's website has removed fireworks from the Tech Specs.  Great customer service, Nikon. NOT.  The other complaint, of lesser importance is I wish the L100 had the 2 second timer which I miss (my Nikon Coolpix S550 had it). It is great to take eBay photos. I don't need 10 whole seconds for things like that. I really can't believe that Nikon is going to ignore me. I will definitely rethink ever investing in another Nikon camera.Almost every review I found on the Internet states that the camera has fireworks. I'm sure this is because they copied Nikon's original erroneous description word for word.  It is frustrating because how are you supposed to trust a company that says one thing and does another?  I'm sure somebody just made a mistake and put fireworks into the Tech Specs. But the camera has been out for many months, maybe even as long as a year and no one caught it?  Now that I've brought it to their attention, they are trying to cover up and pretend it never happened. Shame, Nikon.  At the VERY least you could have called me back, thanked me for bringing the mistake to your attention and apologized profusely.This camera DOES TAKE RECHARGEABLES batteries, contrary to reviews stating the opposite. Nikon put together firmware so the camera can be upgraded to accept rechargeables. This is a sweet upgrade, and I wish they would do the same with the fireworks and the 2 second timer. If you buy a camera today, it should already be upgraded so that it WILL TAKE RRechargeable Ni-MH Battery EN-MH2.PROS: I like the handgrip (although I am having to learn to place my thumb differently as I keep pressing view accidentally). I love the zoom capacity. I have been able to get some AWESOME shots of the full moon. You do have to be in telephoto zoom in order to get clear shots *AND* use a tripod to stabilize.  Speaking of the image stabilizing - it is excellent. Last year I took Santa photos for my job using my Nikon Coolpix S550 and had to use a tripod to get really good pictures. This year I brought my tripod, but ended up taking many shots freehand. The camera performed wonderfully.  Hardly any blurry photos. I like that it doesn't flash unless you open the flash door. This makes it so much quicker to take photos without flash. Just don't open the flash door!  On the other hand, if the scene does require the flash, it won't work without remembering to open the flash door. Nice big monitor and lens. The camera makes me look like I paid a lot more for it.  There was also the learning curve to remember to TAKE the LENS CAP off BEFORE turning on the camera, or the dreaded 'lens error' appeared. However, turning the camera off and back on it goes away.All in all I'm happy with this camera; although my trust in Nikon has been knocked down several notches.I upgraded to this camera because my Nikon Coolpix S550 started getting lens errors which seemed to be directly related to the battery/SD card door not closing properly. The door closing issue got worse the longer I owned the camera, although I was very careful to close the door properly. The S550 lasted just 17 months and is now too unreliable to continue to use. I hope the L100 has a longer life.""
