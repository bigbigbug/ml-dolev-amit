Canon agreed to fix/replace it under warranty but it's an additional $6.00+ to ship it to them so you might want to consider that as part of the cost.""

I am not thrifty, but I wanted a camera that I can keep on handwithout worrying about damage or loss.The pictures are pretty good--this is a point-and-shoot after all.  The resolution noticeably betterthan my wife's Droid and it is slightly better than my old Olympus with 2.1 MP.  Meaningthat pixel count ain't everything.  The files are huge--like 2-3 megabytes.The controls are easy to use.  It has seven knob-selectable shooting modes, like 'auto', 'scenes''live' and more.  This is not really good; I cannot always remember what each mode is for.  The 196-pagemanual is on disk, so if you are in the field and really need the 'toy camera' setting you may beout of luck. On the other hand you could carry a real toy camera as a backup.The viewfinder is adequate, but barely.

It will only play back pics and video through a PC and not through my HDTV or bluray player.  I wonder if most of these newer cameras are the same which makes me upset!  The one feature I wanted was the ability to use AA batteries which it does but still does not make up for it's short comings.

The pictures it takes are aweful very grainy and the color well there is no color it looks like they are black and white images.

I hate taking pictures using the LCD and turning that off provides for much longer battery life.  The fact that it uses 2 AA batteries is also a plus.  Years ago I had an early digital point and shoot that used AA's.  When it ran out of juice at the top of Glacier Point in Yosemite, I was able to go the the concession stand and buy some. If I had been using a camera with a rechargeable battery, there would have been no pictures.I also like the option that permits me to chose an ISO up to 1600.  This should make possible photos in dim available light.  So far, I have not been happy with the pictures I have taken with the flash.  They have been too light.

With the 4 battery cameras the recovery is almost instantaneous, with the A1200 there is a 5-10 second delay that I find painful; otherwise this appears to be an adequate and functional unit. (also probably not entirely fair to compare this $89 camera with its $400+ predecessor).""
"20111220","5.0","Powershot A1200 the last of it's kind","I bought this camera after Amazon falsely advertised a camera with HD video capability. Amazon made good on their mistake so this is my review of the Cannon Powershot A1200...IMAGE STABILIZATION: When I take still photos the digital display literally 'grabs' the photo and holds it still. As cameras go it's the coolest thing I've ever seen. That said, it doesn't mean people and/or objects can move and jump around and get a clear shot. I also took a couple shots with a shaky hand and the camera compensated for it so it's definitely got image stabilization.HD VIDEO: The HD video on this camera ROCKS. I use an Ultra SanDisk Class 6 SD card. Video AND audio are crisp and clear!NOTE: Do NOT use a Class 4 SD card in this camera! I ran two benchmarks using an Ultra SanDisk class 4 SD card vs. an Ultra SanDisk class 6 SD card. The class 6 card had a higher contrast than the class 4 card. In other words pay a few extra dollars and get the best out of the camera. Btw, I ran a class 10 PNY SD card to test video quality and the class 4 SanDisk SD card had the same quality video. Btw, you can also shoot video in VGA mode too.FEATURES: There are more features on this camera than I could ever use in my life but there are a few worth mentioning:AUTO SCENE DETECTION - detects whatever environment you're in and adjusts the camera for best performance; most cameras do this but this feature caught my eye so I'm including itSUPER VIVID - I particularly like this mode, it allows you to take color intense shots, very coolSMILE/FACE DETECTION - I didn't believe this until I tried it but it worked, I smiled it shot! There is a 'wink' function which I didn't try. If you hit the shutter button in wink mode and 'wink' the camera shoots 2 seconds later. So my question is why does the camera have this feature if it already has a self timer feature? I smiled when I read about it so I had to include it too. :)FLASH OR NO FLASH - If you use the flash the camera is a tad slow to recycle but when I turned off the flash I got the exact same clarity in all my shots that I did with the flash on. In all my tests, I personally think you only need to use the flash when it is dim or dark. Btw, without the flash the camera cycles INSTANTANEOUSLY. That was very cool. I fired off multiple consecutive shots to see how fast the camera would perform w/o a flash. I wasn't disappointed. :)AA BATTERIES: Here is what I mean by the last of it's kind... I got this camera because if I am out and about and run out of juice I want to be able to pop in batteries and go... not going to happen with a lithium ion battery! The cannon A2200 and A3300 use lithium ion batteries which means IMHO this is the last camera in the A series to use AA batteries. I highly doubt Cannon will retro back to a AA battery in their subsequent A series cameras. Btw, HD sucks a lot of juice so be forewarned and have a set of batteries standing by if you are going to shoot large amounts of HD video. Use energizer or duracell and NO CHEAP AA batteries or you will be very disappointed.I really love my camera! If anyone is curious download the users manual from Cannon's website to see all the cool stuff this thing can do! I am now a Cannon fan.""

Nevertheless, This is a very cheap camera -- unlike the usual high quality of Canon.  It is very light and very plastic.  It feels like a toy.  I have an A1100is and an A630 Powershot -- both high quality.  I bought this camera as a gift because of the 'old fashioned' view finder (which in reality is extremely helpful in composing and holding the camera steady.

"20111213","2.0","theoretically an ideal P&S for travel... practically a failure","On paper everything's right about the A1200: OVF (a rarity in P&S 2011), 28mm wide lens, light, AA batteries (another rarity), 720p video, 4x zoom, long batt life (LCD disabled)...I bought one just 3 months ago to avoid hauling my more 'precious' cameras during travel long, and to avoid their exposure to beaches and salty spray. I also wanted a smaller sensor for its DOF, expecting poor AF in the $100 price range (validated, very poor and slow). My level is enthusiast amateur; i shoot 10K+ pics yearly together w/ my wife, mostly landscape, travel, macro and street.I shot w/ the A1200 ca. 3K pics and 30 clips. Acceptable IQ iff compared to phone cameras, but not against today's P&S. Lens is sub-average, while sensor and JPG engine are the worst in any Powershot i know of ... way worse than my old A620. Noise, over-sharpening, low DR, so-so colors... perhaps the sensor should've been 5-8Mpix, not more. And yet, the main culprit for the low IQ seems to be the processing engine, and not the lowly sensor and lens h/w.I give it 2 stars only owing to its OVF and AA power, and... Alternatively one could install CHDK ([...]) and shoot RAW with the A1200, though i doubt it's worth the trouble.Net: If IQ is important, one can buy better P&S's today in the $80 range - but none will have an OVF.""
"20111211","4.0","Worth every dime","The main reason I bought this camera was the fact that it has an optical viewfinder. For reasons I can't fathom, camera makers insist on making point-and-shoot cameras that force you to use the LCD, which I hate and refuse to use. Even the old 4 x 5 Speed Graphic film cameras had an optical viewfinder. Couple it with the 12 megapixel capability, petite size, many features for filtering, etc., and the incredibly small price (I paid $5 more than the current price) and it is a clear winner as far as I'm concerned. I have a DSLR if I want to get serious but I can carry this one anywhere and get excellent results. I have a photo in the gallery, wherever that is. I thought when I uploaded it would attach to this review but obviously I did something wrong.""
"20111210","3.0","The old 3.2 MP is better.","I'm not a photographer, but I am a fairly detail-oriented individual.  I bought this camera because I figured more mega pixels meant better clarity, detail and more of an ability to zoom in on an image and crop clearer portions out of it.  That was apparently a very erroneous assumption. This camera feels cheap overall (made in China) and, when compared to identical images taken with an older 3.2 mega pixel Canon A510, this camera falls way short.  I don't recall what the A510 cost new when I bought it, so camera quality-wise I may be comparing an apple and an orange, but the A510 is better built, has much better colors and clarity and, when you zoom in, it has better detail.  So I'm not sure what mega pixels actually do for you after all.  Anyway, I do like that this camera still has the viewfinder and takes AA batteries.  I have another canon (S30) that doesn't take standard batteries and every time I go to take a picture, the batteries are dead, so half an hour later (after charging the battery) the shot is usually long gone.  This is why I now have an A510 which also has the viewfinder and takes AA batteries.  In fact, just out of curiosity, I'm also going to compare this A1200 to the S30 - once the battery is done charging!  In the end, I still believe Canon makes some of the best cameras out there, but I don't consider this to be one of them.""

I did have to purchase the camera elsewhere as they were out of stock on the silver camera.I got the camera to primarily take pictures of honey bees.  I didn't want an expensive camera as I new it would be in some sticky situations. :)  The camera has done great and I'm still learning it.  It has some features that are good for close-ups.  Close-ups are very good, regular shots are good, and HD video is good.  With a 12mp resolution you can crop heavily.  I can't say it's excellent but it's doggone good for an $80 camera!  I'm pleased with it.  Two features that are very nice and that most other cameras in this price range don't have is that it actually has an optical viewfinder and that it uses two AA batteries.  The viewfinder is *very* helpful in bright situations when the lcd screen washed out.  If your batteries go out while on the road you can stop and pick up some regular batteries and keep going.  I use four Eneloop rechargeable batteries and they work great and maintain a charge for a long time...actually better than Duracell alkalines!

(This, by the way, is what makes horse races!) So I thought I would take a chance.Here is why I am happy with my choice: (1) the viewer seems larger than its dimensions suggest; (2) the camera fits in my shirt pocket; (3) the pics are crisp indoors and out; (4) the on-off button is clearly marked and the shot button is nice and robust. For me, these features are all I need. To be sure, the camera has a few video bells and whistles -- I'll try those one of these days. No rush.A Con: the shot button takes a little getting used to, since it appears to have two stages to it. If you just press and disengage, nothing will happen. It requires a little patience and then it will take the picture. I can live with that idiosyncrasy.Another Con: no internal memory. You must purchase an SD card before you can use the camera. This too I have accepted, because having pics on cards does make it easy to load them into PCs and laptops.If you are looking for a simple 'point-and-shoot' camera that will also perform other tricks if you are of a mind, go for it!""

I would have bought the same again but the newest comparable model was the A1200 with out the IS or image stabilization. This is OK for the money. The pictures are good. The body seems light and cheap as if it is made from plastic. The controls are located in a different orientation from the A1000IS so we are constantly pressing or moving the wrong controls. For the money I'd buy it again but only for a low end grade camera. It will be interesting to see how it holds up to the drop test. I hope Canon keeps with the view finder and AA batteries too. That was primarily why I bought this model.""

"20111003","5.0","Visual logic in an illogical world","The Canon Powreshot A1200 has it all -- and more -- in a notably an inexpensive digital camera. The 'more' part is the best. Wonder of wonders, it boasts a traditional camera-to-eye viewfinder as well as a screen, the only model in its price bracket to do so. What this means, quite simply, is that you can shoot with the sun behind you (the optimal orientation) and still see what you are trying to photograph. With the screen alone, virtually nothing is visible if it is even slightly sunny. It's easier to frame the shot as well, as you aren't holding the camera out in front of you at arm's length. A perfect metaphor for the dubious claim that everything is better with modern electronics. Some things are, but others definitely are not. The wholesale replacement of viewfinders with these absurd screens is a case in point.""

"20111001","5.0","An amazing little camera for the money","We purchased this camera to replace an aging Canon A520.  It is quite remarkable how much these cameras have improved in the last few years.  This camera takes excellent photos.  It is light, small, uses AA batteries and has a view-finder.  The photos are very sharp if you take them in 'Program' mode and set the ASA very low.  In some of the other modes, the camera sacrifices sharpness by automatically setting the camera to a high ASA.  This is good for some low-light situation when you wouldn't want to use a flash, but not good in many others.  Sometimes the automated decisions the camera makes about ASA don't make any sense.  Since I normally leave the camera in P mode all the time,  it is not a problem for me.  If you are looking to have the camera make decisions about ASA and flash, you might be disappointed. If you are looking for AA batteries, a view finder, and don't want to spend more than about a hundred dollars, this is a great choice.  I wish Canon made a model that was the same size and added full 1080 HD video and image stabilization while keeping the AA batteries and the view-finder.""
"20110928","3.0","Mixed Reviews","My last camera was a Canon A610. Great camera but I wanted something a little newer and a little smaller. I just want a basic camera that wasn't too expensive that takes good pictures.Pros:Battery - the camera uses AA batteries. This was something I really wanted in a camera. I can't tell you how many times I grabbed my old camera just to find out it was dead. Threw in 4 AA and was up and running again. Some may not care about having the option of putting batteries in a camera but I really like that feature.OVF- optical view finder. I used this all the time with my old camera. Saves the battery. Easy to take pics in bright light. And I find I can hold a small camera like this steadier if I hold it against my face. I have read different reviews here so I can confirm that the image in the viewfinder does zoom in and out with the lens. The viewfinder does only cover about 80-85% of the image you are taking a picture of. It is centered. That is okay with me. I can crop the picture later or just have more of the image than I though I was getting.neutral:picture quality- the picture quality is okay. I've read review of people saying it is so bad/grainy in low light they returned the camera. I have also read people saying the PQ is amazing. I don't if the camera is at such a low price point that maybe quality control is poor. Or if different people have different expectations for PQ. Comparing it to my A610, a 6 year old camera, I can tell you the A1200 does not take as good pictures. While the A1200 is a much higher MP the sharpness of the A610 at every equal ISO level is better. Even lowering the A1200 to 6MP does not do too much in getting the sharpness to the level of my old camera. Does that mean the A1200 takes bad pictures. No it takes decent pictures. Especially in good light. I attribute the difference in image quality to two things. The A1200 does not have a SuperFine setting for JPEG compression. Canon's scale for Superfine is 95 compression. While the Fine setting (which is the best the A1200 has) is 88 compression. Thats a decent amount more compression (5% compared to 12%). When i changed my old camera to Fine from SuperFine the quality dropped closer to the A1200. Second the sensor in my old camera was a 1/1.8 CCD compared to the 1/2.3 CCD in the A1200. The A1200 has a much small sensor which is a big part of image quality.Is the lower image quality compared to my older camera enough to make me return the A1200? I'm not sure yet. The image quality is decent. Especially for such a low price camera with such a small CCD sensor. There is a group on flikr for the A1200. Some very nice pics have been posted. If it produced images that were equal with my older camera I'd keep it in a second.Cons:Processing speed- the time it takes from pressing the shutter all the way down to being able to take the next picture is approximately 2 seconds. I don't think that is too bad but again my 6 year old camera it was about a second. My card is a 5 year old card. However it is a transcend 150x. I'm not sure the class. It would be nice to know if anyone else is experiencing this issue? On every picture I have taken the screen goes blank and a little hand comes up saying busy. I'm not counting the time it takes to press the shutter half way and focus. I mean from the moment I press the shutter button all the way down it takes to around 2 Mississippi until I can take the next picture.Flash recycle time- this is absurd. The manual say it takes around 12 seconds for the flash to recycle but I've never seen a camera actually take that long. But the camera I received does. If I take a picture with the flash after the busy symbol disappears it take about 12 seconds before I can take another picture. I can watch the orange light blinking by the viewfinder meaning the flash is charging. If I turn the flash off it it back to 2 seconds to process a picture.No IS- I really wish it came with image stabilization. I understand at the price point its difficult. I understand IS would not solve the PQ some people are complaining about. But IS would allow me to lower the ISO which would help.-----I'm going to mess around with it some more before I decide to keep it or send it back. I'm also going to consider the 100 HS. I loose my AA batteries and viewfinder but I gain image stabilization and a back lit CMOS sensor for low light.""
"20110928","5.0","Good enough.","Honestly, when this camera arrived I was disappointed.  It seems really plastic and cheap, like something you would buy for a child.  Our previous cameras have had more metal to them, so I guess I was just expecting something more substantial that way.Actually, though, I've been using this camera for a couple weeks and it works pretty well.  This camera can do HD video, and it really comes out quite nicely.There are some fun little features and edits that can be adjusted on the camera, and that's nice, although we have not used them much and I doubt we will.The pictures have rich color to them.  Optical zoom works well, plus there is additional digital zoom.One negative thing: You have to hold the button to take the picture for a few seconds, so it's definitely the kind of camera where you'll ask a stranger to take your picture, and they'll press the button without holding it and they won't actually take your picture, but they'll think they did.  That can be awkward (and disappointing).Sometimes it's hard to get the camera to focus on the right thing.  Sometimes it picks some random spot near what you want to photograph and focuses on that instead.I thought I would like the fact that this takes AA batteries, but I find that they don't last at all.  Our last camera had a rechargeable battery.  I think this is not a problem with this camera; I just need to buy lithium batteries or something.Overall, though, I'd have to say we're pretty happy with this camera.  Pictures come out nice.  Video comes out nice.  I wish I had a fancy camera, but I don't, and this works well enough.Recommended to anyone who wants to take color-rich pictures and nice HD video but doesn't want to spend $700+ on a camera.""

"20110926","3.0","Where have all the small view finder cameras gone???","I needed a pocket/purse size digital camera.  After being in  some spectacular situations, including whale watching, my frustration with my camera's screen glare resulted in a commitment to having a view finder in my next camera.  For a small, pocket size camera...  there are VERY FEW options!  I like this Cannon but would much prefer something with MORE ZOOM  and more pixels.  But...  for now it will do.  Please, camera makers!!!  bring back the view finders!!  I was also annoyed while shopping for a camera because sales people hardly seemed to know which cameras had view finders, internet searches turned up nothing and after my purchase I noticed a few other brands with view finders!  Also, during my search, I met LOTS of people who had the same complaint so I hope the camera companies will pay attention to this issue and come out with something more up dated that will meet our needs for a view finder.  We can handle something a little bigger if that is what it takes.  Missing great shots because of screen glare is just too big of a disappointment!""

Purchased optional monopod with additional ball and swivel because camera doesn't have stabilization. Use it in low light and for movies. My third canon Powershot. And so easy to use and LOVE.""
"20110917","3.0","Good, but not great","I already have a Canon A590IS pocket camera, as well as a Nikon D5000 SLR. I wanted something in-between, with more megapixels for better image quality than the A590IS, but still a compact camera, since the Nikon SLR can sometimes be obtrusive. I also wanted something that used AA batteries, which are both inexpensive and readily available practically everywhere. Recharging expensive batteries that eventually have to be replaced anyway is both time-consuming and inconvenient, and when recharging no longer works, a new battery for a specific camera is rarely available right away. Finally, I wanted a compact camera with an old-fashioned optical viewfinder for framing the shot. I use the LCD screen too, but in bright daylight, the optical viewfinder is simply easier and faster than trying to shade the LCD so I can see it.In terms of size, the A1200 is quite good. It easily fits into a shirt or pants pocket, and it's not heavy.Image quality is just what I was hoping for - significantly better than my A590IS. It's not a match for the Nikon digital SLR, but I wasn't expecting it to be, and the difference won't show up in the usual 4 x 6 print. Only with sizable enlargements (i.e., 8 x 10 and up) will the size of the 12.1 MP sensor have an effect on image clarity and resolution.Operation is straightforward. Buttons and controls are easy to use. The printed 'Getting Started' guide will tell most users all they need to know to start taking photos. The optical viewfinder works as I wanted it to, though I'd like it to be just a bit larger. I'm a big guy with large hands, and sometimes the camera feels 'too small' and/or 'too smooth,' and I'm afraid it will slip out of my hand and fall to the ground, but I'm careful to use the wrist strap. That strap, by the way, is not at all convenient to attach - Canon ought to rethink the attachment setup.My only real complaint, and for me it's a significant one, is that the camera is too automatic. There are lots of shooting options in 'Scene' mode, but unless you've memorized them from the manual (only readable from the CD unless you print your own copy), you won't be able to remember which 'scene' gives you the best shutter speed, or f-stop, or combination of the two. I end up using 'scenes' that don't fit Canon's idea of what I should be shooting because I'm trying to get to particular combinations of shutter speed and f-stop.Obviously, what I really want is essentially the same camera, but with a manual mode, and I simply couldn't find one with manual settings and the A1200's other features without spending 2 or 3 times the money. While some automation is helpful, there are plenty of photo opportunities where I want to be the one making the choices, not the camera, so I've often found the A1200 frustrating to use in those circumstances. 'Easy to use,' which is an accurate characterization, doesn't always translate to the kind of image I'm trying to achieve.Bottom line: for people who don't want to think about technical stuff, and just want to take snapshots, this is a great camera, and the image quality is good enough that they can get good-quality enlargements from the images it takes. If you're more technically inclined, I think you'll find the 'everything automatic' qualities of the camera frustrating. Thus, I only give it 3 stars overall.""

"20110915","3.0","Canon's are always a good choice","Pro's: Light and small enough to fit in your palm,An optical viewfinder, woo-hoo!! easy to use, good editing software,wide angle and some fun effects to use. Decent photos indoor and out. Runs on two ordinary Alkaline AA batteries, long battery life.Con's: Only 4x zoom, wish it had a longer optical zoom but Canon Digital's rarely have this feature,Body is plastic, was surprised not Canon's usual quality at all,hence the three stars.Having stated that, this is a good point and shoot,beginner's camera,the fish eye,miniature scene,and toy camera effect features may be fun to younger photog's, but I found no use for them, there are several scene options fireworks,beach,low-light e.t.c have in my other Canon, nothing new here but are helpful features. Menus seem easy enough to follow as well. LCD shows grainy views indoors in low light, but actual shots come out really well especially when using above mentioned low light opt. Macro shots which I shoot mostly, are fantastic. Highly recommend if you need a simple pocket camera that yields good results and at a good price,having been a loyal Canon buyer for years because of their quality products and outstanding customer service, the viewfinder, which are rare to find on cameras these days is a must-have, trying to shoot sunny scenes while looking at a black lcd and hoping you have a good shot is so frustrating,this eliminates that hassle. Another item worth mentioning is that during movie mode playback I could not hear any noise of the zooming lens which is a plus! Hope this review helps.""

"20110903","2.0","Not recommended for indoor use","I wanted this camera to work for me, as I liked the price and the features like AA batteries,  viewfinder and Canon's reputation for P&S cameras. Unfortunately this camera was a disappointment. Way too much noise at ISO greater than 200, slow performance, annoying color aberrations - both purple and green, soft photos.A1200 sucks in almost any mode indoors, especially Auto. In Auto mode indoors the camera sets ISO ridiculously high and you are stuck with noisy pictures. I was able to get some decent results in Program mode indoors by limiting the ISO at 100, but the exposure time set by the camera didn't allow for sharp enough pictures. Setting the resolution down from 12M to 6M or 2M didn't help much. Some of the indoor Scene modes are usable, but again the inability to limit the ISO in those leads to a lot of noise.Outdoors is a different story, pictures come out with decent quality for the price in almost any mode. They are still noticeably on the soft side and have color aberrations, though.In conclusion, for a camera that lacks almost any manual control, the settings automatically selected by the camera are not good. I guess the selection was forced by the rather small sensor and the tiny lens, but I can't believe this is the best in the entry level P&S department as some reviews suggest.""
"20110903","4.0","Great Value","I replaced an old 2.0 Mega pixel Kodak with this. TWO features were most important in choosing the Canon A1200; optical viewfinder and the use of AA batteries.So far I love the camera, it feels sturdy, and yes I dropped it once already. No damage. Of course it is far advanced over my old camera but still relatively easy to use.Here's a link to some video I shot with it.[...]""
"20110809","5.0","Love the viewfinder!!!","I have searched everywhere and for a long time for a digital camera WITH a viewfinder. I was told by merchandizers that these cameras weren't being made any more. Then I saw the Canon Powershot with one. I absolutely LOVE it because on bright, sunny days there is too often a glare on the screen making it difficult to view the object or persons being photographed. Now I don't have this problem. A GREAT camera!""
"20110805","5.0","Great Camera that just does it's job!","BACKGROUNDJust got this camera shipping direct from Canon (Japan) very neatly packaged.I've previously owned a $2500 Minolta Dimage SLR digital camera setup which got stolen around 2003.  Next, a Canon SD200 ELPH for $100 from a buddy which lasted for years until it stopped working. (Likely due to dropping the custom lithium battery and then causing a short or something.  A newly purchased battery still didn't help, then I broke the tiny plastic door sensor switch.)The Canon SD200 ELPH didn't take as detail photos as the Minolta Dimage SLR, likely because of the quality of lenses and lighter/smaller hardware, but it was very small, light and almost never broke no matter how many times I tossed and dropped it.So, my main purpose of buying this digital camera is for replacement within a budget.  My main use for digital cameras is for traveling and journaling (ie. house construction, landscaping, road work, disassembling electronics and other items...)QUALITYThis Canon A1200 does everything the Canon SD200 ELPH did, and seems to do it well with the newer chips and software features.  Slightly faster image acquisition.  Although, unlikely I'll ever make use of all the features and I turn-off all sounds and user interface eye candy.  As such, I likely save battery power and allow the CPU board resources to focus entirely on taking pictures.Image quality seems similar, if not better.  I've so far noticed darker contrasts in auto mode, but cannot test at all if the previous older Canon SD200 ELPH would perform similar.  It just wouldn't be fair as I can't take exact photos under similar lighting -- besides, there are other resources such as dpreview.com for this purpose.I do notice the live lcd image degradation when using the digital zoom.  It looks like a blocky digitized magnified image on the live LCD screen, but has absolutely no effect on the final image taken or playback through the LCD screen.FUNCTIONS & FEATURESThis model has an additional top dial for picture taking function similar to SLR models, and likely has this because of the larger case to carry AA batteries.  This dial and power button were a little awkward at first, but I am now easily getting used to.  It doesn't take long to realize how useful and intuitive this SLR like dial can be, which is usually omitted on portable pocket like digital cameras.Also, the weight of AA batteries compared to lithium batteries were awkward at first.  If you travel a lot and can afford the extra $200, then the ELPH might be worth the extra money for size and weight factors.I thoroughly respect manufacturers who deploy a basic, medium, expert line of products without cheating consumers of quality!CAMERA CASEIf you're looking for a small factor camera protective case, I just found a great one made by Lowepro called a D-Wrap for about $10.CONSThe *only* things I noticed so far:1) The manual states quite clearly this camera is only licensed for personal use only and not commercial. (Due to the AT&T MPEG4 video?)  But since everybody braves how good Canon is, and their camera products seem to work extremely well with Open Source software (ie. GPhoto2), I had zero problems buying another one of their cameras!2) Their main user manual for this product seems to be only PDF format within the enclosed CDROM.  No biggy once I acquire a Amazon Kindle DX EInk EReader, as I usually dislike studying manuals on LCD screens.  The package does contain a more simple mutli language pamphlet.

This works well, has a nice solid feel to it and I've gotten some really nice shots with it.  Would recommend it - esp for the price.  Understand that Canon is not making it anymore which I think is a big mistake.""
"20110724","5.0","Mighty Mite","Pleasantly surprised with the quality of pictures we get with this camera. The closeups are amazingly clear and sharp. Love the color clarity, which can be adjusted by the number of pixels you choose to use. It's light weight and easy to carry along in a pocket or purse. I would recommend that you buy the little carrying case otherwise you're going to scratch your camera from frequent use, and you will use it. A tripod, if you don't already have one, is another good accessory to have on hand. You get a lot more features and quality than you would expect for a camera in this price range.""
"20110719","5.0","Better than expected","For close to 100 dollars, I expected low quality pictures; however, to my surprise, KAPOW! There were some really good ones. It has multiple settings and it's easy to use. I would highly recommend this camera if you're on a budget and want something good.""
"20110718","5.0","Great Camera","I wanted a decent camera with a viewfinder as I had trouble seeing anything in sunlight.  This camera is beyond my expectations.  I have really enjoyed it and now have to fight with my husband for it!""
"20110714","4.0","Initial disappointment turned into good performance with adjustments","I bought this camera while on vacation in Florida when my old HP 5MP camera suddenly died.  That old camera took LOVELY, high quality photos.  It had a viewfinder, and since I was taking many pictures on the beach in full sun I wanted a replacement with a viewfinder (because who can see the LCD display in bright light?).  This was the only camera in the store that had one, so I bought it.The instruction manual came on a CD and since I didn't have a computer handy, I just put the setting on 'Automatic' and clicked away.  After I got home and downloaded the pictures I was completely disappointed.  They were all a tiny bit blurry, the colors were drab and I was very upset. They looked nothing like the beautiful pictures I had always gotten from my cheap HP camera - they looked like something taken with an old Kodak Instamatic!I read some of the reviews online and after reading through the instruction manual decided to play with the settings to see if I could improve the image quality. Apparently having too many megapixels somehow makes it harder to get crystal clear focus. Since I am not enlarging these photos to poster size, I reset the megapixels to just 6.  When outside in normal daylight, I set the ISO to 80 or 100, depending on brightness. Only then did I start getting some much better looking photos - nearly the same quality as my old camera.So instead of writing a scathing review, I will say that I am happy with this camera now.  I LOVE that it has a viewfinder.  This alone allows you to really save on battery drain, since you can take all your pictures with the LCD turned off and it is the LCD that burns through the batteries.  I am happy that it uses plain old AA batteries - no more having to pack a charger and remember to plug my camera in every night while on a trip. I have had the camera for 2 months, taken loads of pictures trying to figure it out and I am still using the first pair of batteries I put in.I have had many years experience using a film camera, both SLR and an advanced optical viewfinder (even go back so far as to using a hand held light meter!), so I am familiar with changing settings and working with different ISO films.  For those who want the ease of totally automatic point and shoot use, I certainly didn't get good quality photos in that mode.  But it is relatively easy to change the MP's and the ISO setting to improve your pictures and once you reset those, it is pretty automatic.This camera has some fun settings that are a bonus-such as the fish eye setting, vivid colors, B&W, etc.  Overall, I have gotten happier with this camera.  My old HP was a gem, but this one comes close.""
"20110704","2.0","not worth it","This camera is ok for outdoor pictures with good lighting but don't get it for indoor events.  The 'smart' camera won't focus or sometimes even take the shot if the ligting isn't perfect.  Frustration set in quickly and though I usually trust Canon brand.... I hated this camera.  I do understand it is a low end camera... I have nicer ones I didnt want to risk taking certain places... but this is lower than the other low end cameras for the price.  The packaging was fine and I did receive it in a timely manner.""
"20110628","5.0","Great Replacement Canon","After many years our previous Cannon died.  Since we were pleased with the last Canon Camera we went looking for another Canon.  The main feature we wanted was a REAL Viewfinder, not just the screen.  In crowded spaces the viewfinder is essential, as well as almost always guaranteeing a crisp shot!  Price is great and loaded with features, even though my wife will only use it in 'Auto' mode.""
"20110617","5.0","Excellent camera for the money","I've been tracking this camera ever since it was announced on dpreview many months ago.  I bought it not because I need a camera (I already own a Canon T2i) but because I like two beautiful features of the camera--AA batteries and the optical viewfinder.  This means I can take photos on and on without having to worry about recharging the batteries as AA batteries are available everywhere on earth and the optical viewfinder saves me a lot of battery power.  One professional review says two NiMH AA batteries can last 1100 shots with the LCD screen turned off, which is probably true in my test.  Compared with Panasonic S3 I tested before this, images at normal color are noticeably clearer and the style is beautiful to me, too (subjective opinion), but the sharpness is still lagged behind my Canon T2i (18-55mm kit lens). At ISO 1600, images are much grainier than my T2i, which is normal.  Yet, this camera is definitely worth $109.""
"20110614","5.0","Works as Advertised","The camera delivers everything it's supposed to.By way of reference, I've been using an earlier but similar model - a Canon A570is.  The new A1200 has a smaller, inferior optical viewfinder which is probably Canon's way of telling you that optical viewfinders are going the way of the dinosaur - I can't fathom why.The A1200 is smaller and far more complicated which is the trendy concept nowadays.Fortunately, you can put it on 'auto' mode and forget the incredible number of mostly silly features that the camera offers.  I believe that the CD guide says that it will detect smiles if enough teeth are shown.  How about frowns?What really puzzles me is that on the subject of transferring your pictures to a computer, neither the starter manual nor the 181 page CD guide mentions the simple expedient of removing the SD card and inserting it into a computer card reader.  This is how I've always done it.  Does Canon disapprove for some reason??""

"20110601","5.0","Best in its price range!  Beautiful images.","I wanted an easy to carry alternative to my DSLR, and I wanted to keep it around $100. I take a lot of motorcycle trips, and wanted a small camera with a viewfinder  that could produce great images.  I shopped around a lot, and read every online review I could find, and the A1200 won out, and I'm very happy.  Very easy to use, and images are very sharp, with great color and contrast.  I've taken a bunch of great pics just turning it on and using auto mode.That being said, it does have its limitations.  You can't have everything for only $109.  It's not great in low light with no flash, somewhat noisy and sometimes hunting for focus, but low light noise is still acceptable for small prints.  Past the 4X zoom, it enters digital zoom, and this is also not sharp.  The lens' 'sweet spot' seems to be from full wide angle to about 3X.The viewfinder is a nice bonus.  It's not perfect, but definitely usable.  You have to keep in mind, it shows around 80% of the actual image that the camera captures.  This is not a problem; it's easy enough to crop images later if needed.I give it 5 stars.  In even slightly bright cloudy days and above, images are beautiful and super sharp.  I'm blown away by the pleasing colors, nice and rich, yet still natural and not over-saturated.  It covers everything from wide landscapes to semi-macro close-ups.  I've posted several example images in the customer images section.  I'm surprised by the few negative reviews complaining of bad, blurry images.  Either they had a lemon, user error, or they work for Nikon. : )  (just kidding)If you want an affordable camera that is fantastic for landscapes, nature, architecture, travel, friends, etc., this camera is a real winner.""

It takes nice pictures, surpisingly good ones indoors without flash.I turned off the display to conserve battery power and use the built-in view finder. More than 250 pics so far on the original two AA batteries!Picture quality is good to very good, depending on my ability to hold it steady. It beats other cameras this size from other companies. Pictures are reasonably sharp, detailed. The pics are good for posting on the web, sending to friends some work situations, such as real estate, auto sales and such. Photos are not what you would send to a glossy magazine, but this is not a DSL with an expensive lens, either. Pics could be used for newspapers.It's the perfect camera to have along everywhere, all the time, when you don't want to lug around your DSL and lens bag. Pics are at least twice as good as those from camera phones.You can spend 4x as much for another pocket camera that maybe is only twice as good if you need super crisp shots for professional backup to a DSL, but otherwise, this is a very good camera and value. I wear it on my belt or keep it in my shirt pocket (attached to a lanyard) all the time and get shots that I never would have gotten for leaving my big, bulky camera at home.""
"20110525","5.0","Love my Canon A1200","About a year ago I was looking for a point & shoot pocket camera to upgrade my Konica Minolta Dimage X50. I decided to get a Canon A1000IS. When searching for the best price I discovered that the Canon A2000IS had greater features than the A1000IS; ie: pixels, optical zoom, etc. so at the last minute I ordered the A2000IS. The price was not much more than the A1000IS.When the A2000IS arrived I discovered that it did not have a viewfinder like the A1000IS had. I decided to keep the A2000IS to see if the viewfinder was really that important to me. As time went on the lack of a viewfinder became more and more important to me. Recently I decided to look for a point & shoot that had a viewfinder. I did a lot of searching and found that the Canon A1200 was the only point & shoot that had a viewfinder plus all the features that I wanted with a price that was surprisingly low (less than $120).I have been using 2 Flip cameras for my video recording and like them very much. I tested the video feature of the A1200 and found it to be equal or better than the Flips. My first opportunity to really give the A1200's video feature a workout was on a 5 day visit to New Orleans. The sounds of the 'Nawlins' jazz was very important to me, but also the still photos were too. Being able to walk around taking both photos and video with the same pocket point & shoot and switching back and forth between the two was fantastic with the Canon A1200.The visual and audio quality of both photos and video is very good and I am very happy with my Canon A1200.""
"20110523","4.0","Good gift for a family member...","Bought the Canon A1200 for a family member to replace a Nikon that died after only 18 months.  Checked it out first-I was impressed with how quickly the camera powers up.  This camera takes perfectly good shots for a low end point and shoot camera.  Another plus is the power being supplied by AA batteries!""
"20110520","3.0","About what you'd expect for the price","Like nearly every camera in the compact point and shoot category, this camera suffers from too many pixels on a tiny sensor.  Even in full sunlight, at the lowest ISO settings, there is noticeable pixel cross talk / ISO noise in the images, and colors are relatively flat.  Combine that with jpeg compression, and fine textures become an unrecognizable jumble of pixels, and clean edges just don't exist.I'd like to think that giving every camera of this type a one star rating would help convince manufacturers that consumers care more about picture quality than pixel count. But until their current mindset changes, it seems we're stuck with a glut of cameras like the A1200; cameras that have the potential to be so much better if they only had half the megapixels (or less) of their current incarnations.With this camera, the key to happiness is realistic expectations.  So here's what you can expect:- 'Good enough for the price' image quality.  It's not the worst I've ever seen, but grain is always noticeable and colors are either relatively flat or out of balance depending on the situation.  I've played with every possible setting, and there's just no way around this without post-processing.- 'Good enough for the price' LCD.  It can be used for framing a shot, but that's about it.  The LCD is slow, washed out, and streaks with high contrast images.  With regard to color, brightness, and contrast, the screen does not give an accurate representatation of the picture being taken.- Functional zoom and autofocus.  They both can be a little slow and finicky, and the noises the camera makes reflect the cheap components, but they seem to work well enough if you're willing to wait an extra second or two longer than you might want.- Decent battery life.  The manual says 200 shots using alkalines with the LCD on, 400 shots with rechargeables, and 600+ with the LCD off.  I haven't tested all of these combinations, but so far I have no complaints.- Lots of settings to play with, if you're so inclined.  The A1200 has the Digic4 processor/software, and many of the color settings, scenes, controls, etc. that come along with it.  Unfortunately, none of these settings fully compensate for the shortcomings of the image sensor.  With regard to manual settings, the user can control ISO, but shutter and aperture are always on Auto.- An anti-blur / image stabilization mode that, ironically, produces the blurriest images I've taken with this camera.In all, it's a cheap camera and it behaves like one.  If you're looking for something that's good enough for the price, this is it.  It's just a shame that it could have easily been so much better with a lower pixel count.""

"20110518","5.0","Canon PowerShot A1200 review","My first digital camera took good pictures and had an optical viewfinder in addition to the screen viewer.  Since I depend on being able to take quick shot pictures, I used the optical viewfinder all the time.  The only drawback was the high use of battery power.The next was a lighter weight camera, taking good pictures, but without an optical viewfinder.  I spent so much time framing the shot, that I missed too much of what I wanted.  The sunlight obscured the screen even though I added a shade.Then I got my first Canon.  It is a Canon PowerShot A580 with both optical and screen viewfinders.  It is fast, takes really good pictures and does not drain the batteries like the others.  It also takes video better than either of the first two.In January 2011, I read several reviews about the Canon PowerShot A1200 and knew right away that the improvements over the A580 where what I needed.  However, it would not be available until April.  I kept checking with dealers once a week about the availability of the A1200 as soon as it was released, but they did not have it.  After the terrible tragedy In Japan, I was afraid that the Canon cameras already produced and available in the USA would be sold out before I could get one.  When I saw Amazon had a silver one available, but not the black that I wanted, I ordered it at the price Canon had originally published.  (Several days later, Amazon had the black one available; however the silver was already in route to me.)  I used the Canon PowerShot A1200 for every kind of shot I had wanted to try as soon as it arrived.  For the amount of investment, it has the most capability for a non-professional camera, takes excellent pictures, very good HD (720p) video and is lighter than the A580.  I will use this for a long time, maybe until the HD video comes with stereo sound.""

I've owned bang-up cameras by Nikon, Olympia and Canon. So, I know what I'm doing, I would say. I can adjust a camera to use it manually. I don't need to set it to auto and forget it. After all that, I'm disapointed by this point-and-shoot's optical quality. Most every photo seems to be lacking in saturation, indoors or out. I have to edit them all in Picassa to sharpen them up or bring out the color. The flash really washes out faces, at night or in daylight. I guess it's too late to return it. It has adequate settings and all the usual gimmicks like toy camera effects. The video seems good enough. My last complaint is that it seems to blow through batteries way too fast.

"20120503","3.0","Didn't see what the praise was all about..","I purchased this camera because it was 12mp, had HD Video and it was in a great price range.

It's a 5mp Canon, so of course i was looking to upgrade finally, I mean it's 2012 time to move on. Anyway I thought i'd stick with the Canon brand since I had good experience with it. This camera seemed perfect at the time for the reasons I listed above. So I took some pictures with it and every picture came out grainy and blurry. So I figured hey maybe it's just that I'm in the house, took it out with me and this time the pic was less grainy but then the color seemed way off. The color was too bright and just off. This camera does take great HD video, if you want this camera for the sole purpose of recording HD Video then I'd recommend. But pictures not so much. I tried different settings, I tried every setting and all the pictures came out either grainy, blurry or the colors were just terrible. I wanted a camera with HD video but also took great pictures. I returned the camera and I'm glad i did. I'm officially switching to Sony Brand. I got an Sony Cybershot and not only is the video good, but it also takes great pictures which is what I wanted. The sony pictures are crystal clear something I never got with either Canon Cameras.Of course people like different things, some are going to love canon some will love sony.

I also like that it has a viewfinder and takes AA batteries instead. My initial thoughts on the image quality was that they looked like crap. But once I transferred them to my computer I was impressed. For such a simple and inexpensive camera, the quality of images was really good. Even in low light the pictures came out decent. Of course when taking pictures in brighter light the images came out alot better. I think the problem with the camera is not the actual image quality but the lcd screen. Because when I looked at the same pictures on the camera screen they looked awful. So before returning the camera I would check the images on the computer just to make sure its the pictures and not just the screen because you may be fooled.

So I wanted to buy a cheap camera with excellent quality pictures and works on AA battery (easier for travellers, plus Li battery WILL always die. They are expensive to replace compared to AA). I found what i wanted in this camera. I was astonished by the quality of Canon. I believe this A1200 camera is underpriced for the quality you get. The colors are vivid, the pictures are crisp, and no blurr. Even the video is HD and good quality. Something to note is that you can't zoom in/out once you record, but you can zoom before you press record.If you are looking for a cheap camera with great quality of picture go for this camera.

This isn't the one.""
"20110426","5.0","Excellent for close-up nature photography","Like it's Powershot siblings, the Canon A1200 is a heck of a nice piece of equipment for shooting nature close-ups. I've taken this camera out twice now, and so far it has taken wonderful photos. I've posted some samples from a single hike.Although the A1200 can't squeeze in on a subject as closely as the A480 (one of my all-time favorite cameras), this new Canon camera is capable of focusing just an inch and a half away from the subject in 'Macro' mode. I usually carry one or two Pentax DLSR cameras as I hike through miles of woodland trails every weekend, and although they're great cameras, they simply can't beat Canon Powershots for capturing the tiniest nature subjects, in my opinion. If a subject is smaller than a quarter, out come the Powershots.This camera takes photos that easily match or beat the quality of images you'll find in typical nature guides by Peterson or Simon & Schuster. Spend a year on the trail with it, and you could easily have a full set of quality publishable photos. Unlike more expensive point-and-shoots or DSLRs, this Powershot doesn't have camera raw or enough pixels to fill a wall, but the image quality and output is suitable for small posters, so who cares? Frankly, counting pixels and foaming over camera raw are not admirable traits, and neither of those things produces good pictures.Image noise seems to be a bit improved since the A480s and A490s came out, especially when shooting in lower light. This camera has 12 versus 10 megapixels of its predecessors, so in theory you can get a larger photo now and still retain sharpness and detail. The controls will be familiar to anyone who has used a Canon point-and-shoot. I like the general layout of buttons compared to other brands, but that may be just because I'm more familiar with Canon. The A1200 has a viewfinder, which I'll never use because the thing is usually shooting photos right on the ground, and although I like the outdoors, I'm not sticking my face in the dirt and squinting through a viewfinder when I don't have to. The LCD screen is good enough. I've banged and tortured the daylights out of one A480 and killed another one after multiple assaults due to clumsiness. So far, this camera has taken a little knocking around without a complaint.The A1200 shoots HD video, which isn't nearly as good as even an inexpensive video camera, but nonetheless I was surprised that the movies looked as good as they did. When shooting video, you'll get the best results if you stabilize the camera on a tripod, the back of a chair, a railing, or tree branch, depending on where you are. Video compression is a little cleaner that way, and you can avoid making people sick from zinging the camera around like a roller coaster.Here are some tips for taking good close-up nature photos with this camera. I usually shoot with the dial in 'P' mode. Most importantly, always remember to set the camera on 'Macro' (the flower icon button). That allows it to focus as close as 1.5 inches away. Since the camera resets when you turn it off, Arggh!, you have to turn 'Macro' on each time you restart it. On this camera, macro focus becomes dysfunctional if you zoom in, so keep it zoomed all the way out. Next, go into the menu and change the general settings. AF Frame should be 'Center' so you can pick the point to focus on, AF Frame Size should be 'Small' so it doesn't get confused as to where it should focus, and the Digital Zoom is garbage and should be banished forever. Unlike the 'Macro' setting, these settings will NOT go away when you turn the camera off, fortunately. Since this is not an image-stabilized camera model, find some way to keep it still when shooting. When you're focused on a close-up subject, even a tiny movement is enough to blur your photo. To keep my camera still, I swear by a monopod with an adjustable pivoting head. Basically it's a one-legged tripod. A monopod can remove the worst of your hand jitters, and it doesn't even need to be extended to the ground -- just having your camera mounted to a stick helps stabilize your shot. Practice photographing coins or small subjects in your yard to get a feeling for macro photography. You'll notice that the area of sharpest focus is not as deep as it is when subjects are father away. You have to make deliberate choices on the point of sharpest focus. Check the photos on a computer if possible, so you can really see how well you're doing. And finally, shoot a million pictures. This is the digital age. You don't have to pay for dud prints any more. Be vicious when culling out the duds, because believe me, nobody wants to see 75 views of the same buttercup flower.""

All of our cannon printersare still operating.On the negetive side for me the camera picture quality is aboutthe same and somewhat less in some scene renditions than the A850 (4mpix)I suppose that MegPix is not the measure of a clear shot when it comesto printing the final product on the same Cannon Printers.

"20110416","4.0","Great little camera","Canon maintains its good reputation with this camera. It has a viewfinder, unlike most point and shoot digital cameras these days. The lcd display shows grainy in low light conditions, but when the pictures are taken they're of great quality.""
"20110412","5.0","Excellent camera for the price","I bought the Canon A1200 because I wanted a small point and shoot that I could take everywhere with me. Other selling points were the optical viewfinder which I don't really use much, as well as the AA batteries. I use Sanyo Eneloops in this camera and they work great. I don't know how many pictures I can take with them on a single charge because I end up recharging them before they die completely.The biggest surprise for me has been how well this camera does in low lighting. I have sometimes had trouble with getting good exposures in the dim lighting in my house but not with this camera. The sensor seems to be tuned for low light performance and it is a consistent performer for birthday parties or just taking snapshots of my kids.I uploaded a few of the artistic shots I've made with this camera and I can say that the A1200 has exceeded all of my expectations for a point and shoot camera at this price range. It is a great performer and with a little effort it will take great images. I've messed around with some of the preset options and they help a little bit, but the auto setting works well if you don't want to fiddle with things. Also, the Discreet Mode is great! I accidentally took a picture with auto-flash and interrupted a speaker, so now I always use this mode to disable the focus light and flash when needed.On a final note, I bought a Lowepro Volta case and it's a perfect fit, though there is no room for spare batteries. I just wanted a slim package that I can fit in my pocket. It's a bit bulky but not an inconvenience. I highly recommend this camera if you are on a budget and want a solid performer at the hundred dollar price range.""
"20110404","5.0","Best inexpensive, easy-to-use compact, and the viewfinder is a plus.","I bought two of these cameras, one for my 10-year-old and one for my 14-year-old, because it has all these features I was looking for:(1) the image-quality is superb;(2) it is one of the few compact digital cameras that run on AA batteries (a feature my 14-year-old son will find useful when he studies and travels in Europe this fall);(3) it is one of the extremely few compact digital cameras that have a viewfinder (a feature that my 10-year-old daughter wanted);(4) it has a 'smart auto' setting and, even more foolproof, an 'easy' setting for the simplest use possible;(5) it can store a lot of images on a 32-GB SD card (a feature that is good to have when cameras are taken away to summer camps or boarding schools);(6) taking HD movies is simple; and(7) it comes at an unbeatably low price, making it a great value.My children had no problem operating this camera from minute one. I highly recommend this camera!""
"20110402","1.0","Poor Photo Quality","I own 4 Canon cameras, including an HD camcorder (HV30), and love them all. I have a Powershot A95 (actually, two of them) that I have taken literally thousands of underwater photos with, and even though it's just 5 MP, the photo quality is excellent. So when my A1000 suddenly died, even though I had only had it about 6 months and have not used it much, I chalked it up to bad luck and went and got an A1200 as a replacement. This is just for leaving in my briefcase and mostly using for work-related photos where quality is not as important as convenience.Silly me, I thought decent photos were the first thing a camera should do. Features and so on are nice, but it has to take at least decent pics. So even though the A1200 is an inexpensive camera at $109, I was still blown away by how bad the photos were, incredibly grainy in various different lighting conditions, indoors and out. I tried all the settings, reset the camera, tried again, but after 1 day I returned the camera (not bought through Amazon), took a 15% restocking charge at Fry's Electronics from a rude salesclerk, and went to a real camera store. I explained what I was looking for, even said I was willing to go up to $250 for a better camera, but in the end got a Nikon Coolpix L24 for $129 that takes great photos. I still got the AA batteries I wanted but gave up the view-finder. On the other hand, it has such a large, high-quality screen, that I guess I don't miss the view-finder.To sum up, I am really disappointed that Canon would put their name on such a poor camera. Even at this price range, the photos have to be better than that. I'm getting ready to buy my first DSLR soon, and now I will still look at Canon, but also a lot of others.""

"20110312","5.0","Best Camera Of Its Type - Like The Wide Angle","The Canon A1200 has the features which we value most and as such, is our favorite digital camera.  In particular,* It can take wide angle photos - the equivalent of 28mm on the older film SLR's* It uses 2 AA batteries which is great - especially when traveling overseas.  In the past, we encountered too many occasions when a battery became exhausted in the middle of the day or could not be recharged at night.  This was especially true when traveling overseas.  So now we only consider cameras which use AA batteries because they can be purchased almost anywhere.* It takes HD video.* Its size is compact and can easily fit in a pocket or purse.  Years ago, I enjoyed taking photos with SLR's and wore out 3 of them (the film versions).  However, I missed many shots on vacation because I did not want to carry an SLR everywhere I went.  The compact size of the A1200 allows us to carry it everywhere with ease.  And it takes high quality photos.* This camera does not offer as many options as some others.  However, it gives you the options people use most of the time.  I do not miss the other ones.There are a few negatives.  Cords to connect the camera to a TV or DVD recorder are sold separately.  And it is difficult to force the camera to flash - it wants you to choose the mode and it will decide whether to use the flash.  Also, this camera does not have the option to merge 2 or 3 shots into a panoramic picture.  And it does not zoom in as close as some other cameras.  All that said, we shopped around a lot and, in our opinion, the A1200 has the best combination of features and size.""

Intuitive control set. What I don't like 1. The top mode dial to far right, and shutter button/zoom dial should be interchanged. to me this is more intuitive. Initially I tried to use the mode dial, till I was able to retrain my brain. 2. The trashcan button can only be used in review mode. I delete a lot right after the shot because I can decide in my initial review if the pic. With this I have to go into review mode, then delete. Since timer shares this button, it is easy to set timer, and not realize it. Remember these are my personal gripes, and these could be non issues to others. Also I never read manuals, and can usually figure things out. The menus for me were easy to navigate, but could be more difficult for others.

Don't know, I'm really pleased with it.""
"20120328","5.0","THE absolute best camera out there","This is my second Canon camera and my third point and shoot. What caught my eye with this camera was the price and the megapixels. We took it skiing this past month to Copper Mountain and took bunches of pictures and several movies. Let me digress. My first camera was a Canon S100, a 3 megapixel that took great pictures and I still have it since is it smaller and lighter. The only problem is that the early cameras used NiCad batteries that often lost its charge when you needed it the worse. My second camera was a Nikon. It uses AA batteries. My only issue with the Nikon is that the camera was difficult to use and the picture quality was not good. The Canon A1200, while a little thicker than the Nikon, is by far the better camera in both quality of the picture and the ease of use. Megapixels are not the only selling point for a camera. The quality of the camera is a combination of lens quality, megapixels, the quality of the megapixels and the speed of the lens itself, meaning how well it functions at low light and how well and fast it focuses when your shooting a moving object.The movie capabilities were exceptional. I used it several times taking pictures of my wife skiing down the hill. The camera didn't shake and the colors and pictures were excellent even when I was using it with my gloves on. It is almost HD quality. With the enclosed software or iMovie on your Apple, you can cut, transfer and mail your movies quickly. You download your movie with the enclosed mini-USB to your computer or by using your SD card.You will need to purchase a SD card when you purchase your camera. It also takes AA batteries and they seem to last  longer than did the Nikon AA's. Using AA batteries in a point and shoot will make your camera larger but the A1200 will still fit in your pocket.It used to be that Nikon was king of the hill when the world revolved around SLR camera's. Now that point and shoot camera's are the norm, next to cell phone camera's, Canon is by and far the better point and shoot camera out there. As battery technology gets better, the point and shoot will become smaller and better.""

The Kodak was top of the line 9 years ago, but looking at current pictures compared to other cameras it was time to move on.  I looked at more Kodak cameras since the last one held up so well, but after reading many reviews the Powershot seemed to be the way to go.  I'm not at all disappointed in this camera.  It's very compact, and easy to work.  The menus are very easy to navigate, and taking pictures is essentially dummy proof.  This camera truly is a point and shoot.  No need to try to figure out what setting is best, the camera does it for you.  Just set to auto, and push the shutter button.  The pictures are clear and crisp.  Transferring the pictures to my computer is a breeze.One feature I specifically picked this camera for is the view finder.  Yes most people take pictures now by looking at the screen, but I still like to look through the camera (hey it's the resistant old man in me).  It's one of the few digital cameras on the market that still has a view finder.  Although I noticed my resistant ways are wearing down, as I've found myself using the screen to take pictures several times now.  Either way, taking pictures is as easy as it can get, and the photos are great quality.  It's a great camera at a price that can't be beat.""
"20120312","5.0","Laymans review of the Canon A1200","I received my camera last week and started playing around with it. Pretty cool stuff and since I was already familiar with the Canon interface, easy to navigate. This weekend I had my first opportunity to give it a run. Now, as the title states, I am a layman with cameras. I don't really want to know about F-Stop and apature (did I even spell it right?!). I want to set my camera to AUTO and shoot and, of course, I want good pictures.  Having read some reviews one noted that the 6MP setting work over the 12MP setting. So I did a bit if testing on my own. I took 149 pictures this weekend and of those 50 were probably duplicates where I snapped a 6MP pic and then a 12MP pic. With very few exceptions (maybe 3 or 4) the 12MP won hands down. The pictures are vivid and crisp and look like something a professional would take.  I also took some video and they too were vivid and crisp with no lag or streaking that I have seen before in other videos as they were sweeping across the landscape. I put Energizer rechargable batteries in it and carried two spare. I was winter hiking in the Adirondacks and the temps were cold (18 degrees) to warm (49). The batteries lasted both days and they still have life left in them. So good battery usage even though I used the screen vs. the view finder.  For under $100 including a 6GB memory card I have a great camera that takes great pictures.  As for durability, we'll see. The camera doesn't have the 'solid' feel that other Canon cameras I have own did. But, it is EXTREMELY light, which I love since I am already carrying a heavy pack when I hike. Also, the camera was subjected to humidity from my body. At one point the display was damp with moisture and I thought it would never recover. But, once back in the car, it was as good as new. If you want an inexpensive point and shoot that takes amazing picture and video, you can't go wrong with this one.""

"20120222","4.0","Great viewfinder and camera HOWEVER....","In the past using the rear digital display meant rapid battery death so you NEEDED a viewfinder. No more!This is the perfect all-around-do-everything camera.  It's easy enough for snapshots but allows enough creative control to do seriously creative photography.It's perfect for vacations due to its small size and self-timer technology. (I advise a plastic micro tripod for best results with a self timer.  See end of this review for more info.)Pros:  Lasts reasonably long on two double regular AA alkaline (not even lithium) batteries even if the color  DISPLAY screen is left on continually.  (It has the best  battery life of any digital camera I've owned  to date .. however, I've only had two digital cameras prior. (Not comparing it to state-of-the art)  It takes regular AA batteries which limit your ability to shoot if you have a good supply.  A macro mode for extreme close ups that works very well.  The ability to prefocus/meter & re-compose.  (e.g. you can keep subjects at sides of the frame sharp.  Manual adjustment of everything significant. (film speed & white balance to tungsten,  fluorescent, resolution meter type from spot to center weighted to 'evaluate' and the ability to lighten  or darken over a span of 4 'stops' 2+ and 2- from the auto-exposure to adjust for metering errors.)  'Creative' filters (B&W or sepia, or bluish hues), fish-eye (see Canon's ad copy for more.)  Pre-sets for faster and properly exposed snapshots in tricky lighting conditions or situations (beach,  snow, moving objects)  Self timer technology that allows a wink to set off the shutter.  The battery compartment (despite some complaints) seems fine. (After you open it a few times it's  easy.)  Time exposures up to 15 seconds (for tripod shots of course)  'Syncro-flash' mode - allows flash and extra time for exposure of background (a city skyline at night)  The display screen mode allows a check of autofocus in half press / pre-shoot mode (gives a  rear panel close up)Cons:  Viewfinder & zoom are frustrating to use together.  1) The zoom button switches from shooting to editing mode if you zoom too much or wait too long  between shots.  2) The viewfinder does NOT show the 'digital zoom' portion of this camera's zoom range so  at maximum zoom 'digital' range (or macro) you MUST look at the display to see what your image.  3) Too many in-camera editing features which always start inadvertently while shooting.  (Who has time to do all that in-camera editing while shooting?  What are they thinking?)  There SHOULD be an option to shut off all but the ERASE feature.  4)  As slow to fire as every other camera at THIS price range. (If you're hoping that, by now, they've  perfected a lightning fast but cheap camera... keep dreaming.  Maybe in five more years.)Summary:  I bought this model FOR the viewfinder and kept it DESPITE the viewfinder being of very limited utility  because finally USING the REAR DISPLAY EXTENSIVELY does NOT run down the camera's batteries after even  50 or even 100 shots. (outside without flash)  Finally a digital 'auto-everything' camera that matches and surpasses my best old film version of  this kind of camera by which I mean:  A camera you can always have handy when events or creative  opportunities arise that suits nearly every need.  At the price it seems like a great value!==================================================================================================================Below info and advice on micro-tripods only for those really enjoy using the self-timer feature:  If you're like me you want to BE in your pictures with your significant other(s).  But have found that there is NEVER a good surface directly across from that will hold your camera at the necessary angle in a remote area.  If you are in a busy place you must rely on a well-meaning stranger who invariably takes a blurry and/or poorly composed picture.  The answer a good MICRO - mini tripod.  They make super small ultra-light plastic tripods that fit inside a good belt size camera bag.  (My current one folds up to 6' long x 3' wide, about as thick as the camera, fits inside a modestly sized waist belt and weighs about 3 ounces.)  Use one and you will be able to compose PERFECT self-timer shots even on an elaborately composed picture ANYWHERE!""
"20120221","5.0","Very nice point-and-shoot for not much money","The optical viewfinder means that, for me, this is finally a point-and-shoot that isn't a giant step backwards from the old film point-and-shoot cameras that I used to use for casual snapshooting.  It would be better if said viewfinder were more accurate, and if it showed what the autofocus was zeroing in on, but the LCD screen does that.  Not an SLR substitute, but you can stuff it in your pocket and get decent shots from moderate wide-angle to moderate telephoto, which is kinda what you should be looking for at this size and price point.""

"20120213","5.0","A great camera for the price!","This camera does everything i want it to do except take zoom shots. I love having the optical viewfinder for sunny days or when Ido not want to remove my sunglasses. The canon software is also easy to use and has crop, trim etc features available.For an every day (in your pocket) ready to go camera, its much better than my cameraphone.""
"20120213","4.0","Great-the second time","We ordered this camera for my parents for Christmas. When they opened it Christmas day and began to use it, the pictures turned out blurry and highly saturated.  The exchange process was easy, and a few days later a different camera arrived, perfect right out of the box.""
"20120212","4.0","Works fine","A very good buy for the price. It's nice for traveling because you don't have to worry about different voltages and electrical outlets - just take a couple extra batteries with you and you're set. Sometimes the camera takes a longer than usual time to reload the screen right after the picture is taken, but that's about the only issue I've noticed so far. Otherwise, serves well and has lots of different modes.""
"20120207","5.0","I expected a lot from this camera, and it delivered.","When i learned i was moving to NEW ZEALAND i decided i had to get a camera soon. After looking, i decided the Canon A1200 Powershot sounded good, and for only $99 (Price when i bought it at least.) Which was great. The Camera is awesome. Takes brilliant pictures, and that was put to the test in New Zealand. Battery life is great, even on blinking 'Replace Battery' light, it still takes days of light use to die. It has plenty of features, modes, etc. So if you need something simple or something a little advanced too, for a great price, this is for you. I suppose it's kinda big for a digital camera, when i could have bought a smaller one for slightly cheaper, but hey, this thing is worth it. Of course, dont get me wrong, its not perfect, ive had a few isolated issues with it, but nothing bad, at all. It takes great Macro (Close up) pictures. i took a picture of a keyboard and it showed like, every fiber and spec of dirt on the white keys. Brillian camera. The only person who might dislike this would be a professional (Or more experienced) photographer who'd be willing to shell out upwards of $500 bucks on a cam. But for average people, and even people who need a camera for frequent use, this camera is nice. I take it with me everywhere. I do NOT regret buying this.I hope i did okay on this review, i rarely review things.""
"20120205","3.0","Horribly grainy photos, takes decent videos though","I couldn't be more disappointed in the quality of the photos this camera takes at a short distance, and it also appears to be nearly impossible to take even a halfway decent macro shot with it. Medium- to long-distance photos turn out quite nice, and the video quality is not too bad either.Battery life is pretty poor as well, in my experience, but that can be mitigated somewhat by always having rechargeable batteries charged and ready to go.Overall, a very disappointing purchase.""
"20120204","4.0","Great little camera","I've been happy with this camera so far.  Love the ability to use a viewfinder.  The video is nice too.  Some people commented on the grainy display...this only happens in low light and it does not affect the pictures.""
"20120204","5.0","Cannon Powershot A1200","This Cannon Powershot 1200 camera is all that one could hope for in a convenient camera.It has excellent Optics (Cannon has always used excellent optical glass for it's lenses) readily available AA batteries (A big plus over the more expensive and not always available prismatic batteries that many cameras are now using)and a host of features too nomerous to mention. And finally a price that can't be beat. I wonder just how Cannon can produce such an excellent camera at this price.No, I do not nor have I ever worked for Cannon.Steve""
"20120204","5.0","Cannon Powershot A1200","Was looking for a Point and Shoot camera, with a view finder, which are getting hard to find.In bright sunlight it can be hard to frame your picture on the LCD viewing screen. This camera had all the features I need, and more than you need if your just a casual picture taker. So far it has performed beyond my expectations, and very easy to operate. I would recommend it to anyone just wanting a very good camera to take pictures without a lot of settings to worry about.""
"20120203","5.0","Good purchase","This camera beats the H.P. one I had and paid way too much for.  Thank goodness they're not making cameras anymore.  The Canon Powershot is easy to use, easy to set and takes great pictures.""
"20120202","4.0","Canon powershot","Low price and great camera. Easy and simple top use. I had it for almost a month and have no problem with it. I had to get this one since my wife  like the easy dial function on top.""
"20120129","2.0","On a budget? Pick something else.","Despite a number of unusual features (e.g., AA battery powered, optical viewfinder), this camera is simply not good enough - even as a budget camera. The primary problem is the noisy CCD. Even in ideal light, photos and video are quite grainy.I purchased this camera primarily to take advantage of 720p24 video with a relatively high data rate (higher than most). You'd never know it, though. The video is so-so at best.I never planned to use this camera for snapshots, but if this is your purpose, you'll like this camera even less than I do. You will not have to spend much more to get a much better camera for casual use.""
"20120129","5.0","Great camera for a novice !!","I puchased this camera for my wife. After reading the instructions (highly recommended) she was able to take incredible pictures. We are very impressed with the quality of images in daylight and in low light.""

"20120118","2.0","Don't do it","I wanted a point and shoot camera hat took decent digital images, at least on par with my crumbling but trusty 5 year old digital Kodak point and shoot.  This is an inexpensive camera with some excellent features; optical viewfinder, standard interchangeable AA batteries, compact size. My expectations were not high. But the image quality of mine was simply hopeless. In side by side comparison of equal resolution images this device produced without question worst pictures with the most visual noise and distortion of any machine in our office. Unacceptable. I've been very pleased with other Canon products and can only hope for their sake this is a fluke our mine was defective.""
"20120117","1.0","Garbage Camera - Garbage Attitude","The Canon PS A1200 is a piece of garbage, defective in either production or design.  It tries to do too much and does nothing well.  Its images have too much noise in anything not shot under noon day sun. Sometimes objects appear as if drawn by crayon.  Auto Focus is also erratic, with no evident override.Worst of all was Canon's 'get lost' attitude.  Their response was that there were no 'known issues' on noise. (Well...then THIS camera is defective, right?)  Their advice was: (1) set the camera on auto (Well... duh) and (2)  If that doesn't work, try manual settings. (Huh?)THANK GOODNESS for Amazon, which gave me a 90% refund even though I had gone past the 30 day return window due to the fact that it took a while to verify that the problem was the camera and not me.I will NEVER buy a Canon product again.  Assuming the company didn't just slap it's name on garbage a company that refuses to own up to its mistakes is not worth my business or anyone elses.  I've had GREAT luck with NIKON and FUJI and will stick with them.""
"20120116","3.0","Defective/Very poor packaging!","Bought this camera because (1) it had a view finder and (2) Canon is my favorite brand. Very few cameras have viewfinders anymore and this one is VERY small!  The 4x optical zoom is adequate for me!  However, it was packaged with almost no filler/cushioning and was rattling around in the box when it arrived.  The poor packaging may have damaged it!  It would not take a single picture!  A reputable, local camera shop told me it had a defective 'card' deep inside the camera, so I returned it.  I was leaving for a trip right away, so I bought the same camera from a local store where I paid more. It works fine--though I have not yet had any of the pictures developed...  Also, have not yet tried the video feature.""

"20120110","5.0","Love it!","Not necessarily a camera for professionals, but good enough to take pictures for DVD covers on low budget productions. Serves its purpose well for family outings, sporting events, casual photography or whatever. Has plenty of cool features, good quality pics, easy-to-use software & components. I have no complaints, a canon is a canon which means its a quality product!""
"20120108","4.0","Constant companion - Good value","The Canon Powershot A1200 is wonderful... Takes good pictures and even video. Is conveniently-sized so you can always carry it with you in a pocket, purse, or attached to your belt. Has some 'bells and whistles' which are easy to use. Has a handy optical viewer. And fits perfectly into a little Tamrac 5686 Ultra-Compact Digital Camera Bag which has a velcroed pocket for an extra memory card. At just under $100, the A1200 is a great deal.""

"20120106","5.0","Great value for us "snapshot" folks","While I just purchased the A1200 and have taken a limited number of pictures, I am very satisfied with the compactness and capability.  The pictures I have taken involved flash, extreme close-ups, people and landscapes.  The major reason for the purchase was the optical viewfinder - the LCD on our other camera was impossible to see on many sunny days.This is an excellent value camera for a new user or second,third camera - for those of us who take 'snapshots'.  Your photos can always be enhanced on Picasa and similar products.Very well satisfied.""

"20120102","4.0","great point and shoot","The only point and shoot camera with a veiw finder.  I find that with just the LCD screen, I can't see what I am taking a picture of when in bright light.  With this camera I can use the veiw finder in bright light and the LCD screen other times.  The zoom is easy to operate.  The camera is just user friendly.  I only wish it had more programmed settings.""
"20120102","4.0","Satisfied customer","I wanted a small camera with a viewfinder, since I often take pictures in bright sunlight.  I also wanted a wideangle lens.

"20111230","3.0","OK","It's a decent design. Made in China. VERY light. The battery door is a bit tricky, and could be easily broken. Easy to operate, but the buttons and connectors are a bit small for a senior to operate. No memory card included.""

"20111228","4.0","Yeah!  A view-finder!","Great little camera - very easy to operate.  I bought it because it has a view-finder which seems hard to find these days in inexpensive cameras, but it's very helpful with sunny shots.

"20111228","5.0","Great camera!","I am a major fan of photography and I love taking pictures. I wanted a really good camera that wasn't too expensive. I was shocked when I stumbled upon this camera. I read through all its features and read the reviews and decided to get it. I am VERY happy with it. The quality is amazing, especially outside. It takes great up-close photos. I keep the camera on Auto and it seems to work well for every situation so far. I have seen other Canon cameras that have the same kind of features that are more expensive. If you want a camera that takes great up-close photos and has high quality in most situations, but is not very expensive, then this camera is your best bet.Also, I've seen some people talk about how the picture looks grainy before you take it. Yes, in dimer light it looks grainy, but once you actually take the photo, the quality is excellent. Just fyi.""
"20111227","3.0","No memory card included","I bought this for my 75 yr old mother, thinking it would be easy for her to shoot pictures of the grandkids.  Unfortunately, the memory card is not included, and it doesn't function without a memory card.  Luckily, she was at my brother's house for Christmas and he went out and bought her a memory card.  They should clearly state this in the product description before you purchase.""
