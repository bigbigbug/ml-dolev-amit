When I first did my search to purchase this card with Amazon, I entered the make and model of my picture frame.  Prior to all this I purchased a memory card from my local computer accessories store and that card did not work in my picture frame either.  So that is the reason why I decided to purchase it from Amazon - I thought I could identify my product so I would get the exact item that I need.  But that did not work either.  The card works in my Nikon D90 camera though, so I have an extra memory card for my camera - maybe I can sell it.""

Others say shipping is too much, but you that is more depending on merchants.

I had this up on my wii for most of the time, then I bought some more and put them to different use. IT isnt too hard to figure out at all, I installed it into my camera and it worked well, its pretty intuitive. Just pop it in and connect it to your pc and your photos should show up. I am very happy with this product and believe I will buy some more, again the price is not too shabby and the quality uis just right as well so it makes sense, for me. I would have liked to been able to get just a little larger size out of it since it is pretty pricy, but after all you could just buy in a bundle and save some cash.

"20101202","1.0","Bait and Switch Alert! Item shipped not what they advertise, doesn't work.","BAIT AND SWITCH ALERT! I ordered traditional blue normal San Disk  4 gb disks as advertised here for christmas gifts like digital cameras and to use myself with my camera. As of ten minutes ago, the ABX Protech listing (here at amazon.com) displayed the blue san disk memory card that I always buy from Best Buy, which is not a bulk item, and comes with a usb and reader. However that is not what this company sent. ABX ProTech pulled a bait and switch, shipping an entirely different product, that does not work with my digital items.BEWARE! If you order this, you will not get the Traditional Blue San Disk memory card that they advertise and what they send will not work with your regular electronic devices.Particularly problematic is that the ad- which was up until a moment ago when I complained- showed the standard blue memory card, and now they have changed it. Luckily I printed copies of my order and took a print screen image of their ad from today showing how they advertise one item and shipped another.Even more shady, there was no packing slip or invoice in the package and they charged enormous shipping fees ($15.00) for a tiny envelope package weighing less than 2 ounces that they mailed first class.I have requested a full refund- including shipping and handling, but have not heard back. ABX Protech has a very restrictive and laborious refund policy under which you may not ship anything back until you receive a 'return' number from them.Avoid ABX protech at ALL COSTS!""

When I asked for a refund , they said I have to wait one month more...That is really ridiculous:)))So , it appears that I should wait about two months,counting from the day when the order was placed...I would never order something from this seller again...""

"20100107","4.0","Sandisk 4gb card for Canon","This card was bundled with the Canon camera for a small extra charge.  The real value was the free shipping and no sales tax through Amazon.  I prefer 4gb cards over 8gb since I can carry several cards and download and clear them when I am ready.  With 8gb I tend to keep shooting without re-formating and end up downloading the same pictures over and over to get to a few pictures I want to email.  I carry several cards and a backup battery when traveling in foreign countries so that I can label the cards and download them when I return.  Sandisk is a good brand that I have found to be reliable.  Don't let sales clerks at electronics stores sell you high priced 'faster' memory.

"20090705","4.0","Works well","I bought this product after running out of room on my Nikon D40 DSLR camera.  The card is recognized by the camera and expands my current capacity (1 GB Card) from 200 pictures to 1000+ pictures.I have one notable issue - not with the card, but with the way Nikon handles larger capacity cards.  The D40 (and as I understand it, the D80 as well), only displays 3 digits for the picture capacity.  As such, my camera displays the card capacity as having 1.0K instead of 1000.  This is apparently by design.  As you cross from 1000+ pictures to 999 pictures, the camera does indeed show 999.One other minor issue.  SanDisk should have included a carrying case for the SD card.  No case was included, thus I must always store an SD card in my camera and swap the other 2 cards I have.  This shouldn't increase the cost very much, but would have been a very welcome addition.""
