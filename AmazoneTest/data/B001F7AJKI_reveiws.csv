"20120611","5.0","Great Quality, Low Price!","The memory card actually came in the mail two days earlier than estimated by Amazon so I was very pleased about that. I previously used a Sandisk 8gb sdhc card that was full and to move all of its contents onto the 16gb sdhc card took only 20-25 minutes. The 16gb card has 14.8 gbs of space, but no memory card has the entire amount as advertised so I was happy about the added space I would have! Overall the quality is great and what a low price! I would definitely recommend or purchase another one for friends and family!""

"20120326","5.0","Excellent value for practically any phone","It may not be the fastest memory card that money can buy, but it's more than sufficient for my LG Extravert (which can accept up to 32 GB).  $8.50 for 16-GB of class 4 memory is a pretty sweet deal -- especially one with the SD adapter, like mine.  Most phones just don't need anything faster than that, since their primary function is not capturing copious amounts of HD video (my phone doesn't capture HD anyway).  Everything I copy to/from the card in the phone via USB mode is nearly instantaneous.""

This is noticeable when opening and browsing the photo gallery. Great purchase.""
"20120321","5.0","Amazing!","Well, I honestly can't say anything bad about this product. I ordered 2 of these and I am quite pleased. The price is far lower than any other site I've found, the cards come with Micro SDHC to standard size SD adapters, they read 14GB when formatted, they both worked without hassle, they arrived A LOT sooner than estimated, and they are SD brand.

It's not to anything fancy (i.e. a LG Wine II UN430), but it at least allows for 16GB of storage.I was skeptical because of other purchasers claiming to have received another brand besides SanDisk. Well, I wasn't one of those people. The SanDisk 16GB MicroSDHC, Class 4 arrived quickly and in a nice plastic case. I formatted the card on my phone and added some music to the card via computer.It's been working with no problem so far, but I've only had it for a few days. Yet based on my previous experience, I'm pretty confident the card will keep working fine.""
"20120319","3.0","Micro SD to SD Adapter is Junk","The micro-SD cards worked just fine for VGA video recording, but the included Micro SD-to-SD adapter is a piece of junk. When I slid the Micro SD card into the adapter, it felt really loose. My computer wouldn't read the card, so I popped off the lid and found that the gold-plated spring fingers that were supposed to make contact with the Micro-SD card weren't making proper contact. As a former electronic technician, I believe this failure was due to a design flaw, not a manufacturing flaw - there is no positive spring pressure on the contacts of the inserted card. I added several layers of scotch tape to the inside of the device to apply the needed pressure, and managed to read the card. I bought two of these and both exhibited the same problem.Most folks probably don't need the adapter anyway, but if you do, I wouldn't rely on this one.""

"20120317","5.0","Make sure to do your research","Make sure to do your research when looking for flash memory.  There are numerous claims on Amazon of items not matching descriptions or being potentially counterfeit.  None of us here on Amazon want to go through the hassle of returning a product.  So it might be worth it to you to pay an extra 5% in order to increase the chances of a smooth transaction.  Sandisk is a solid brand - other reviews will testify to that.  I was happy about this purchase and the transaction was smooth.""
"20120316","4.0","Good choice","Very well worth the price. I use it at multiple places - digital camera, smart-phone, tablet, laptop/desktop. It fits well in the macro-adapter. BTW, it's a class 4, meaning the access (read/write) speed will not be as fast as a class 10.""

Class 4 means that it is fast enough for recording 720p video (my phone simply does not record 1080p), which in turn means no speed-related problems in everyday use. You will probably spend about 30 minutes copying your files to the memory card during initial set-up, but that's it.

I saw the brand name 'TRANSEND'. It was used like new.I don't see any defects or anything that will ruin it yet. Although it doesn't feel durable. It literally feels like it can break into dust at any moment.I don't know what the hell brand TRANSEND is, I've never heard of them. So I am a bit worried.Its working fine as of now, but all over the packaging it says Sandisk everywhere.I am pissed I didn't receive my actual package, but I feel it would be a hassle to return it and hoping to god it does not break on me.The speed for class? I'm still transferring music of 6.4 gb's to the card, its been about 20-25 minutes.Probably a class two.I'd just warn anyone wanting this exact item, be warned.

A great deal!!Also, when requesting a return, the this seller of the Sandisk instead of accepting that it was bad wanted me to test it in my computer and somewhere else.  Now, I did Not buy this for my computer but for my MP3 player in which it did not work.  I contacted Amazon and they were a super help (as always), in suggesting how I handle this.  The seller then accepted it back and I received my refund.  However, I am out the shipping of course and this was as much as the chip as I recall.

"20120127","5.0","Very Pleased!","When I got the SD card in the mail, I already began to worry. When I grabbed the package out of the mail box I could tell it was only in the little plastic case that holds the SD card and the adapter, definitely not brand new packaging. However, as I began to inspect the card, there were no signs of previous usage. I plugged it in to the comp and it was clean. I was worried weather or not it would actually be a Class 4 bc of some reviews on here. But I put 6gb of data on here from my old card and it transferred in less than 20 min. Once everything was on the card, I put it in my phone (LG G2x) and was good to go. It was like my phone didn't miss a beat and just gained 8gb more external memory. Now back to Class 2 or 4... After running about a dozen tests, I'm averaging 5.5MB/s write & 16MB/s read... So I feel extremely happy with this card and feel that I definitely got my moneys worth. I would highly recommend this product!

"20120125","4.0","Great card...","Great card, works great, is exactly what it says, and comes with SanDisk's standard warranty. A couple things to remember, 16 'gigabytes' in manufacturer terms equates to about 14.9 true formatted gigabytes (because a kilo for a computer is 1024). Also the MicroSDHC standard is the same card and interface as the old MicroSD; the difference is in the compression method. This means that many smartphones that didn't support SDHC when they were made can support it if the software is upgraded. An example of this is any Windows Mobile phone that has been upgraded to WinMo 6.1; 6.1 supports SDHC.""
"20120123","5.0","Works great, but be remindful of dishonest sellers","I was very skeptical when I placed my order because despite the overall 4.5-star rating, there has been a wave of complaints about illegitimate SanDisk MicroSDHCs.When I received mine (I ordered two), I immediately checked for traits of a legitimate card.  Fortunately for me, I have the model number and other traits that look identical to the ones they show on the SanDisk home page.A few test runs also convinced me that mine are indeed Class 4s rather than anything lower as many claim.  So give TAC Digital Trading Inc. some credit for selling legit items.  Just a reminder that one should pay attention to Seller Profiles when purchasing popularly pirated items.I use it for my Nokia C6-01 for apps, pix and videos.  My phone takes 8MP pictures and shoots 720p videos so large storage is instrumental.  This 16GB SDHC does it perfectly.  I was a little worried that a Class 4 may not be able to handle 720p recording, but this card did it just fine.Overall, I am very happy about this product, especially for just $15 apiece.""

It greatly increased the capacity and allows me to take endless pictures and videos.

I thought that maybe because it was only a class 4 card, did I need something faster?  Did I go to big?  Should I go back down to maybe an 8GB?  All of my fears were squashed when HTC came out with an update.  I'm not sure what really got updated, but it's as fast as when it was new.  There's no more waiting when I navigate from screen to screen, it just does it.  So the card works fine. Most likely, the card was never the issue.  I also use one of the in my VuPoint wand scanner.  No issues there, scans are fast and instant.  I scanned a whole book and it seems like I'll never fill up the card.For the price I picked it up at, I definitely recommend one.""

A couple of days after returning for replacement, Kefers sent me a message telling me it was incompatible with my device and they refunded my $$.  My concern is that I put data on the card then couldn't tell if the data was actually removed prior to shipping back.  A SanDisk microSD should not be incompatible with my device.

"20110607","5.0","Perfect. Exactly as described","I was looking for a Micro SD card to add more memory to my AT&T HTC Inspire. I was weary of buying it online once I found out that there were so many rip offs online. I figured I'd look on amazon and find one that had the shipping fulfilled by amazon at least. When I ordered this card on May 27, 2011...the shipping was fulfilled by amazon. As of June 7th, 2011...it's no longer fulfilled by amazon and even sold by a different seller.So this review is for the item being sold by 'MemoryMogul' and the item being shipped by amazon.This card is the real deal. When I emailed the seller and asked if the card was real and if it came in the retail packaging...they told me that it was new...but since they purchased in bulk, it only comes in the small plastic container along with the memory card adapter.I went ahead and ordered one. You couldn't really beat the price they are selling it for. Retail for a 16g class 4 Micro SD card is anywhere from $70-$80! For about $20, I got the same thing.It arrived on time. When I opened it up, like they said, it was just the plastic holder and it was in a small plastic baggie. I put it into my phone right away and my phone adjusted to it very quickly and easily. I checked the memory available, and it was just a bit above 14g. I don't remember the technical aspects...but I do know that you don't always get the FULL memory of any type of memory card. So I knew that the card was a real 16g card.So far so good. My phone is working beautifully and I am not worrying at all about memory space. Great buy.

The speed of transfer was impressive, considering I was moving something like 5-6 GB at a time between the Nook card and the new card.

I also have a ton of music on my phone now, so that pretty sweet I have the availability to make my phone into something like an iPod, except that it's not as easy to use like an iPod when playing music.Get this if you don't mind the very seldomly lost file (rare, but it happens), and you want to hold a lot of info.  Great for blackberry phones.""

"20090703","5.0","Works fine with my Moto Q phone.","The product worked like a charm on my Moto Qh phone.  One thing to check though when you buy this amount of memory for a phone or any other device is the connection speed with your computer.  The phone connects at USB 1.1 or lower speeds and therefore takes FOREVER to sync.  That is no fault of the micro SD card though, just be prepared to wait a while if you plan to fill a significant portion of the card's capacity.  Also it is VERY small, again no fault of the card, but it did take some skill to install the card in my phone.""

Together with the on-board storage, it gives me just a little more storage than the over-hyped 16G iPhone.It is a Class 2 card, so its transfer rate is slower than some smaller cards, but I haven't noticed any problems with video or audio playback.  Still, I'd like to see a Class 4 version in the future to allow for faster data transfer. Also, I purchased this card to replace my last 16GB card that got corrupted and became unusable (after about 2 months).  I've had this one for almost 2 months with no problems so far, and the last one is going back to SanDisk (they have lifetime warranties).

"20081130","5.0","Exactly what it says","Great card, works great, is exactly what it says, and comes with SanDisk's standard warranty.  A couple things to remember, 16 'gigabytes' in manufacturer terms equates to about 14.9 true formatted gigabytes (because a kilo for a computer is 1024).  Also the MicroSDHC standard is the same card and interface as the old MicroSD; the difference is in the compression method.  This means that many smartphones that didn't support SDHC when they were made can support it if the software is upgraded.  An example of this is any Windows Mobile phone that has been upgraded to WinMo 6.1; 6.1 supports SDHC.""

My first attempt led to a corrupted card which I had to return. May have been a manufacturing defect (bought from best buy, not from Amazon. Best buy charged 99.00). I reccomend loading the card in the device before adding data rather than using the reader and then inserting loaded card.All in all, a miracle of storage on a tiny card.

"20120424","1.0","Cost me a phone","I was eagerly awaiting the delivery of this 16 GB memory card from SoCal Trade. But the glee suddenly turned into a nightmare. After reviewing the manual on the proper manner to install the card I opened the package and carefully installed the card. I then hooked up the cable between my phone and my computer. However, the computer would not recognize the card. Instead of allowing me to transfer files to the phone I kept getting some kind of warning message. After several attempts of connecting and disconnecting the cable with no luck, I decided to remove the card and try a 4 GB memory card I purchased from a different company. However, the 16 GB card just fell apart with part of it still in my phone. As a result, I had to damage my phone to get the rest of the memory card out. Thereby preventing me from ever being able to install another memory card in this particular phone. However, I had no problem installing the 4 GB memory card in another phone and getting it to work. It was either a defective product or possibly damaged during shipping. So even if I happened to get another memory card it will no longer work with my phone, so the product cost me phone. If I now want to use a memory card. I will have to buy another phone.""
