At the time I did not understand because I have several Point and Shoot cameras around the house with almost the same specs. However, she said she owned the camera and it was fantastic.I have had the camera now for over two months and I use it ALL the time! It takes wonderful pictures! It is a little bulkier than my other cameras but that does not matter. I have yet to find a camera that you can literally just point and shoot and get a good shot, this camera you can! My other cameras, it would take about 10 pictures before I got one that was not blurry, too late, you name it.I have to take a lot of inside and outside photos and this is the camera I carry with me. I will say the night time photos are not the best unless you are taking them up close. My other cameras I grab to take photos I need to zoom in at night, from a distance. This one just pretty much takes a black photo and does not pick up much on zoom at night but that does not bother me.For the price range, I am so happy with this camera. Granted I did not buy it, it was a gift but I spent a lot more on my other cameras and they are not near as good as this one. I was buying Pentax, Fuji, Samsung; you name it thinking I was getting a good name. I did not think Panasonic made great cameras but they proved me wrong. I will stick with them in the future.""
"20120520","5.0","Amazing camera for affordable price.","Bought this camera because I was heading for vacation and I had a friend who had one she loved for the last 4 years, and it was a great price with all the specifications I needed. My last camera was a more expensive Canon that became useless in about 6 months. My sister and parents bought the same Canon($200) and both were also unhappy with it. I just took a week vacation to New York City and my pics are so fabulous!!! There are so many extra features that are easy to figure out on this camera that, even with horrible lighting on some occasions, I was able to get pics that my photography major friend with her $1500 SLR camera couldn't get!!! I was able to take several hundred photos without charging the battery. The charger comes with it (the Canon didn't). I would just snap away even though I didn't think the pics would turn out well, and at night when reviewing them, I was surprised to find I didn't have to delete many. LOVE it!!!""

The video is also 720p HD and does not zoom in or out during recording. It can only record up to 2 GB of videos at a time which is about 10 minutes (according to the estimated time). I tested it out and it recorded up to 15 minutes. I think it could record even more, but I never tried that long. Also the battery life is pretty short especially when you record a video. After a few minutes the battery bar goes down. But overall, it's pretty good.""

I love all the optional scene modes. So far, because of weather, I have only taken indoor pictures of my cat. It has a 'pet' mode that works great with no red-eye. It takes great pictures in low light. The flash was pretty bright in automatic mode, but in 'pet' mode it was perfect. Also, with the light from the windows it didn't even flash and the pictures were great! I tried the 'movie' mode and it worked wonderfully.

However, I was shocked to find out that the camera isn't plug and play with my Macs. Or iPhoto. It is my fault that I didn't actually think to look at compatibility when I bought it, because it seems hard to find an electronic (especially in cameras) that isn't Mac friendly anymore, but here is me telling you that it is only Windows friendly natively.That said, I found the way to import my pictures from this camera into iPhoto from ehow.com that involves a few more steps, but for those who like 'easy', the way almost everything is on a Mac, you may want to factor this into your decision if you are considering the Lumix.""

"20120206","5.0","I Dream of Leica","Many other fabulous reviews, so I will keep this short.  This camera is small, and so light it feels flimsy and cheap at first.  But even with no view finder, this camera is a must have for any serious amateur photographer.  Not so many menus you need a master's degree to use it, image stabilization is incredible, and for all the press the Leica lenses get (and well deserved for sure), what places this camera light years ahead of some of the other more popular brands - the light metering.  Yes,  you get sharp...everyone does sharp.  But you're going to have to look long and hard before you get such constitent, evenly exposed pictures that take advantage of light as in the Panasonic DMC-FH25K.  I went out and took pictures of a few dead and hibernating trees on a clear winter day - and got shades of yellow, gold, and brown that I couldn't see with the naked eye.  Posting for few for you guys to see what I am talking about here.  Yes, there are a few things I would like to see improved.  Batterly life.  And anti-relection material on back screen that makes it glare proof.  But having owned other cameras in the price range - Nikon, Canon, Olympus - this one is by far best in class.Highly recommend.""

A friend who was a camera buff recommended this camera to me.  First I went and tried it out in a local store against other cameras.  The Cannon Sure Shot was recommended also but when I tried it out it took too much time between pictures.  My Lumix has been used at Disney World, Christmas Programs and Legoland Florida and the pictures look fantastic.  I may be just a point and shoot gal but this camera gives me professional looking pictures.""
"20120202","4.0","A fine camera, with a few caveats...","I got this camera during a sale for a cool $100, and so far it's been a great deal. It replaces a 5-year-old 5MP KODAK camera (where the contrast got all messed up), and in comparison it's superior in almost every way - it's smaller and lighter, takes great quality pictures, and records movies in HD. The menus are easy to access and navigate, and the LCD screen is sharp and bright. You don't really need to use the software; I just plug it in and let Windows (XP) transfer the pics/movies right to my computer (I use AVS Video Editor to edit or convert the movie files when needed). I've mainly used it to take pictures of small setups for items going on Ebay, and it's worked out nicely.I bought a Kingston 8GB SDHC card to go with it; it holds around 1200 pictures at max quality and plenty of short (10 minute long) HD video clips. The battery drains faster with movies so it's nice to have an extra; I also bought the Wasabi Power battery set (comes with two batteries) which is compatible with the camera.Three negatives I can think of are:-Taking pictures in high light often brings out reflections...the flash is blindingly bright as well-Taking pictures in low light can result in grainy pictures...you'll need some ambient light to avoid this-No zoom in movie mode - the camera automatically focuses on things, but if they're far away you can't zoom in""
"20120130","5.0","Panasonic DMC-FH25 16.1MP Digital Camera","Excellent value for this high MP digital camera.-Extremely easy to set-up, charge, and use as a daily/vacation camera.-Grab a 16GB HD-Class10 card and most casual shooters will have plenty of storage space, even at the highest MP setting.-Zoom is functional and what you would expect for this price range. Don't expect the results you would get with a Nikon D3 w/400mm glass. Reasonable results are achievable with this little unit.-People shouldn't compare these point-and-shoot cameras vs. higher-end Nikon or Canon DSLR's. These higher end units can sell for $3,500 for just the camera body w/no lenses....lenses upwards of $3,000 alone. You won't go out shooting professionally (weddings or events) with one of these as your primary rig. As with any picture, lighting is everything.-Pix settings are easy to use. When on Auto-A, the camera does most of the work. Flash is decent/good. Again, don't expect the on-camera flash to perform like a high-performance SB-900 Speedlight.-Colors are good. Again, lighting is everything.-Battery life is good, better than expected after heavy use. Easy to charge.This is a great point-and-shoot camera for those that are looking to capture daily pix (birthdays, parties, vacations, etc.).""
"20120129","5.0","Great travel zoom!","We bought this camera for our daughter who was going on a 10-day mission trip to Kenya, followed by a short safari in the Samburu Refuge.  I liked the decent zoom range, plus the 16 megapixel resolution should make for very good cropped photos.  Plus it is quite compact.  She was thrilled with its performance, and lots of her team members were impressed by its results.Our daughter is not an experienced photographer, so she left it in i-Auto (? - I think that is the term) most of the time.  By and large the photos were very good to excellent.  She sometimes used the eZoom button, which uses the full optical zoom plus digital zoom.  The photos in this mode were not as good, but at least she captured the target.  When using the eZoom mode, the contrast dropped a good bit and more noise was present.  I believe a good post-processing software package can make many of these photos even better.So I highly recommend this camera as an excellent value.  BTW, along with the camera I bought her two spare batteries from the main auction site.  The seller is named orphanbiker, and I have bought numerous batteries from him over the years.  She was on the third battery by the time she got home, and captured 450 images.""

Even after treating it like a very breakable piece of crystal, never dropping it, the camera lens began acting like the others.I have had it for a little over a year. Yes, some may say, that is not bad, but I am so tired of the same problem happening regardless of the brand. So, I just began another search for a dependable camera.In reading about Nikons of competitive value, I noticed one reviewer had the same issue with the Nikon. I do not know for certain, but I am assuming the same manufacturer is making these lens or lens motors for all these brands and probably 'Made in China'!  Now I will research Samsung and Pentax cameras.""

But when it arrived and we used it for a few days, it became apparent that it wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. The pictures were of poor quality. They were blocky and not smooth, not at all what I expected from a 16.1MP camera. We had an old Kodak 6.1MP that died on us that took great pictures, with amazing color depth. This one didn't even come close to it with more than double the pixels; I wouldn't recommend this Camera. We returned it and got a Cannon Powershot.""
"20111230","3.0","Don't just go by the excellent ratings, not a good low light camera","Summary: The excellent rating for this camera is misleading if you're comparing it vs. a much more expensive camera.  And despite the marketing, this is not a good low light camera.After we decided to upgrade our 4 yr old Cannon Digital Elph SD1000, I thought that I could go by the reviews on Amazon. I was deciding between the this $150 Panasonic with 4.5 stars and a $330 Cannon S95 which also has 4.5 stars.  I figured if they have the same ratings, they must be fairly comparable.  Well, I think I was wrong. When I received the Panasonic, I immediately compared the low light pictures with my old SD1000.  The SD1000 low light picture quality was much better.  Besides that, the whole feel of the camera just seemed lower quality vs. a Cannon.  So I decided to return this Panasonic and spend the $330 for the Cannon S95.  I haven't received the S95 yet, but will update this review when I do.Bottom line is you can't compare a 4.5 rated $330 camera, with a 4.5 rated $150 camera.  People purchasing a $330 camera are expecting a much higher level of quality vs. people that purchase a $150 camera.  Those expectations means a 4.5 rating for a $150 camera is actually much lower vs. a 4.5 rating for a $300.""

I wanted to replace my camera because it was not always turning on, sometimes not taking photos and a few other problems. The camera I was replacing was a non-expensive one, but the photos turned out twice as nice as this Lumix does. I read the manual, used the cd that comes with the camera, and still am not getting nice pictures. Many of my photos turn out over exposed, blury, and of not good quality.  Even when I try to photoshop, the pictures are grainy and not nearly as vibrant. Also, a big appeal was the claim of how long the battery life was. In my experience, the battery lasts just as long as any other camera I've owned. Overall, this camera is ok, but not nearly as great as I had expected.""

"20111209","5.0","Very happy with this camera","I just bought this camera as a replacement for my Kodak Easyshare Z8612 that I absolutely hated. I figure I would like just about anything that came my way that didn't gobble up the batteries. I am very happy with this little Panasonic. It easily fits in my pocket and most women's jeans have ridiculously small pockets. The LCD screen is bright and clear and the 16 mega pixel specification isn't lying. What I didn't realize up front is that it runs off of a lithium ion battery instead of two AA batteries. That was no problem as it comes with a charger new. It is easy to take pictures one handed and the start up time is about 2 seconds. The optical zoom is average and the digital zoom -like all point and shoot cameras- is not wonderful. The controls are simple if you take the time to play around and figure them out. All in all it is a great camera for someone who wants to just slip it out of their pocket, snap a picture, and be done. I have no complaints thus far and I am confident it'll stay that way.""

"20111207","5.0","Panasonic DMC Digital FH 25S camera","It had been 10 years since I purchased a digital camera and had to wade through scores of them and the benefits of each. I was looking for something in the price range of $100 - $120 at the highest. Didn't need a lot of bells and whistles. This Panasonic Lumix is slim and compact but packs a punch. The LCD screen provides great resolution for pictures and video. The buttons are easy to use and do not get in the way when gripping the camera. The features and functionality allow even the least experienced user (like me) to figure out the simpliest things, such as the flash features. Comes with a battery charger and cord to download pictures. It does have some memory but that was used up after about 4 pictures so you will need to get some sort of memory card. All in all, excellent camera for the price paid.""

Expensive lesson. And their customer service department is very rude.""
"20111203","5.0","A good point and shoot camera","This is a good point and shoot camera. For that you need to set in IA (intelligent Auto) mode. This mode will automatically adjust the camera setting for a given lighting and distance. In a regular camera you have to manually adjust these setting otherwise the picture will not be good and eventually blame the camera. Panasonic has eliminated this problem.Battery life is good (took about 150 pictures and still had battery power). Flash brightness is pretty good (well the IA mode helps)Con: After taking pictures, could not use memory card directly thru memory reader or on laptop. Gets formatted to Panasonic camera. Need the software (included with the camera) to down load pictures on laptop. I bought 8GB memory and can take 1120 to 4000 pictures or 45 minutes video.Hope this will help.""

"20111130","5.0","Great Camera!","I bought this camera with high expectations - I would love to have a point and shoot that takes pictures close to DSLR quality, and truthfully (to my untrained eye) this camera gets very close.  The level of customization is well beyond what the average user will need, but it's still not confusing or hard to operate.  It's fast and responsive through the menus, and starts up very quickly for those short-lived photo opportunities.  As with a lot of cameras, the flash washes out the subject in poorly-lit areas, but in auto mode, turn off the flash and let the automatic iso adjustment work its magic!  The lens is deceptively large, which I assume is a good thing.  I particularly like the Vivid/Happy color mode - it brings out the colors a bit more and makes pictures look very 'HDR'.  I've only owned it for a few hours now, so I can't comment on longevity or build quality, but I've put it through it's paces and I am very satisfied with it.UPDATE: I just got back from vacation with my wife, and the vacation pictures have received a lot of complements, even by a few seasoned photography junkies.  I've found that the flash tends to wash out the image a lot indoors, so I've been turning it off if it does so.  I've had the camera for almost two months and I still think its great.  Battery life is excellent, I only had to charge it once while I was on a week long vacation.  I'll try to post a picture to the user submitted photos if I can figure out how to do so.""

I've been prying it open with my fingers every time I have to take a pic. Sometimes sticking half way open, sometimes not opening at all.

One says for taking pictures of food, I laughed, but when photoing my Thanksgiving dinner I forgot to set it to food, so I took separate shots of the pumpkin pie and it really looked delicious in those settings and did not photo well in the others.Everything seems great except I notice when veiwing my videos, the volume is usually way low and it's ruined many moments I thought I was capturing of my children.

"20111125","4.0","Good in low light","I am a grad student in need of a camera that could handle photographs when doing research in archives that do not always have well lit spaces. The difference between my last camera is literally night and day. I have fewer foggy and shaky images. Also, the multiple face finder makes it easier to do a quick photo in a room with low light. I don't feel like a turn-of-the-century photographer making everyone stand still for 3 minutes any more!The negative is that the zoom button is exactly where my right hand goes to hold the camera. I accidentally bump the speed zoom and have to stop to undo it.At the end of the day, I'll take one slight inconvenience for the fact that the camera is so slim it can even fit in a woman's pant pocket without looking bulky, it takes great photos, and it is reasonably priced.""
"20111125","5.0","works great!","I bought this camera for a trip to Fiji.  I have an underwater Canon camera that I have found to be unreliable.  It stops working from time to time (arrrgh!) and I didn't want to miss a single shot.  I wanted something inexpensive, small and simple.  This camera is so easy to use and takes great pics.  (I've received many compliments on my pictures so far.)  It fits perfectly in my hand, the zoom is great.  My much more expensive Canon took one picture and died.  Again.  Without this camera I would have had one picture of Fiji!  I haven't bothered to read the manual, and I have over 400 amazing shots of my vacay.  I put it in a ziploc in my dry bag and took it kayaking in the rain.  I took it out in the heat, in the sand.  Again, a million times better than my waterproof, shock proof, temperture tough Canon.  I think I'll look at Panasonics underwater camera next.  I should have bought it in the first place.  If you want a simple point and shoot, you won't go wrong with this.

"20111111","4.0","Great little camera","Bought this camera for our Alaskan cruise at the last minute after finding out my old Canon wasn't working.  Wanted something I could slip into a pocket and that would take good pictures.  It did both quite nicely.  The zoom also worked out well when taking pictures of glaciers where we could only get so close.  It was no match however, for whales and such against those professional looking cameras I saw others on board with that had telephoto lenses, etc.  You can't expect it with a point and shoot though.  Looking at the pictures on my computer moniter truly amazed me as to the quality of the photos as it captured the magnificent Alaskan scenery beautifully.Pros:  Nice, clear sharp pictures for a point and shoot.  Great size and weight, slips into pocket or purse nicely.  Zoom was improved over my old Canon, but I guess this may be true of most newer cameras  Price is low enough that I didn't sweat every minute about what may happen to it.  Very easy to use.Cons:  In bright sunlight, as with all types of cameras with these viewfinders, it's difficult to see what you're taking a picture of.  We simply took tons of photos and deleted the ones we were less than thrilled with.  It's not as if you're wasting film after  all.""

"20120518","5.0","VERY Pleased with Purchase of the Lumix FH25k","I bought this camera as a replacement for another Lumix point and shoot I had for the past 5-6 years.  I've always liked the build quality and great pics that the Lumix family of cameras provide.  What sold me were all the stellar reviews on Amazon, the Leica lens, and the rock bottom pricing ($139 a few weeks ago).The camera feels light in your hand- almost too light.  Not sure if the body is made of metal or plastic, but it's small enough to pocket if you had to.  I'd prefer to place it in a belt looped case for added protection.  It might be a tiny bit longer and wider than a standard deck of playing cards.  What warrants the 5 star rating from me?  What should always matter the most with cameras - picture quality.  I made a few basic settings once I got the camera in the mail - highest picture quality, vivid color setting, anti-shake setting 'on'.  I popped in the battery after it was fully charged (about 90 minutes), and a new 8gb class 10 SDHC card.After heading to the wilderness of the backyard, I snapped all the familiar images I always seem to shoot when testing out a new camera.  Flowers, textures, any stray bugs or birds that might be out.  I always take a few shots in the shade, the direct sunlight, macro, as well as zoomed shots.  The Lumix FH25 delivered in spades.  Shots were HUGE on my monitor - I was very pleased with the sharpness, contrast, and color saturation in all of the test shots.  Detail on some of the flower shots were amazing - gentle textures on the structures within the flower were razor sharp.  Focusing is fast, so I doubt you'd ever have to blame the FH25 for a missed shot.I've only just started to explore all the various shooting modes- just sticking to the basic shooting mode or the Ai mode for now.  If you're looking for a quality camera with a lens everyone knows as one of the very best, search no more.  The Lumix FH25k delivers.  I'm very pleased with my purchase, and look forward to years of shooting with my trusty new camera.""

Better 16MP cameras seem to cost a lot more though so it's a tradeoff. If you're looking for a medium quality pocket camera then this one is not bad but I bet that there are cameras with more honest descriptions of their capabilities.

I own a larger Panasonic that I am very pleased with but I can't say the same for this one.  I was pleasantly surprised at the zoom.  It is crystal clear as long as you are in daylight.  There are lots of settings on this and probably too many because it gets confusing.  Also few of them work well.  I did get decent results from using the candlelight setting and the pet setting but not many of the others. Also the stabilizer works well. None of my recent photos have been blurry.  However, the photos are never consistent.  I can take 2 or 3 shots of the same thing in the same place at the same time and each one will have a different look (mostly brightness). Also, the battery door is very flimsy and I am afraid it will break soon.Overall I would not purchase this camera again for my needs but for a basic user it would probably be fine.""

The best pictures are on Happy mode which to me is like the old Vivid mode on the prior models. The video on these is sharp also. Using a tripod (the simple cheap flexy type) I set the camera on it and put it on firework mode. The video was outstanding. I only wish it had souround sound but no big deal since the stereo sound was very deep and wide in it's recording.MY biggest issue wasn't with the camera at all but Amazon suprisingly.....In the past, free shipments were sent right away and they arrived usualy 3-5 days before the date quoted. Now even if it's in stock it will sit till a day or 2 till the due date and then ship. Usually the transport company gets it to me in 2 days after shipping. So Amazon, why the delay from you.

"20111028","5.0","Does what we need it to do","This is our second mid-range model Lumix, and I like it even better than our first one. It's small enough that we really use it; it fits into pretty much any pocket and doesn't weigh much. The biggest bonuses are the image stabilization feature and the non-delay between hitting the shutter button and actually taking a picture. We get many more usable pictures because of those two things, and with fewer shots overall. It also warms up and is ready to use quickly after being turned on. The video quality is good, though obviously not as good as a dedicated video camera, but possibly easier to use, and the quality is fine for filming impromptu clips. I find the buttons and features and icons easy to use, but that's at least partly because I'm used to the Lumix conventions. I do recommend getting it in a nice bright body color, like this blue one or in red or gold or something, because that makes it so much easier to find -- there are a lot of little black box gadgets around the house these days.""
"20111028","1.0","Nice looking camera...Low quality photos","This camera looks nice and is very easy to use.Sadly that's where it ends. As I tend to do a lot of photo editing, I need a camera that takes a reasonably sharp photo, not professional SLR quality, but decent quality. Sadly this camera fails miserably. Although the photos look nice initially, a bit of a closer looks makes the poor quality of the camera lens very noticeable. You don't have to be an expert to see this, just increase the photo size to full-size and zoom in a bit and you will notice a major fuzziness or edge bleeding around the objects in the photo, which is unacceptable.Don't get me wrong, if this camera was about $60 cheaper it might be worth it, but at it's current price it's just not worth it. Don't be fooled by the 16MP, if you want a standard point and shoot camera, save your money and get a cheaper camera, as you are paying extra for nothing with this camera.Another thing I find a bit annoying, is that you have to remove the battery to charge it. Although this may not seem like an issue, the last camera I had you could simply plug in the camera, or better yet charge it with usb. With how flimsy the battery door is I wouldn't be surprised it it broke off. Plus if the battery dies the camera can not be used, where my other camera could be used while it was plugged in.""

I just set on intelligent auto and have been more than pleased with the results so far.  Very glad I purchased this camera, and would purchase again.  If Amazon could have sent the email offering me a better deal on the camera BEFORE I purchased my camera, it would have been even better!""
"20111024","5.0","Tiny and great","I was looking for a pocket size camera with good lens. That's exactly what I got. I can take great pictures, it is fast, the battery lasts like forever.""
"20111021","5.0","Easy To Use","This camera takes great pictures and videos in 720p. It's small and compact enough to fit in your pocket to take with you anywhere you go. The feature I use the most is the intelligent auto setting. It will automatically sense the best exposure settings and enable/disable flash accordingly. you can of course adjust these settings in other modes manually, but the intelligent auto setting works perfect for me and takes wonderfull pictures indoors in low light or outdoors. I love this camera so much I bought another one as a present for my mom and she loves hers also. I use a 16gb memory card to store pictures and videos with. The videos can be played back on your computer as they're .mov files that windows can play on it's own without installing any special software. My only complaint is that you can't zoom in and out on the camera while recording. you can zoom in and out prior to recording but not during recording. I won't take away a star for that as the quality of the video is still very good. The video quality in bad in very low light and will turn out grainy. as long as you know this ahead of time you can make sure to have the blinds/curtains open to let sunlight in or have lights on indoors as this is not ideal for video recording in low light. It does take good pictures in low light as it uses the flash.""
"20111021","5.0","Simply Wow","I'm totally impressed with this camera.  I'm just a point and shoot guy; don't need anything fancy.  But my simple needs include no/very small delay between pushing the button and taking a picture, very little pause between taking pictures, a very good zoom, simple controls and fits in my pocket.  This camera delivers them all.  Particularly impressed that I take very few fuzzy pictures anymore due to the quick shutter.  I really like the slide switches for on/off and take/review.  Much nicer than buttons or pushing arrows, especially since I use these two functions a lot.""
"20111020","5.0","Excellent pictures - make sure you let i focus","This camera takes excellent photos - scenery or people.  So far I like using Normal Picture modevs. intelligent Auto for most shots.  The focus is very good as long as you let it focus before pushing the button all the way down.  Controls are easily understandable and the menus are a breeze to navigate.""
"20111019","5.0","Excellent Quality at a Great Price!","I've waiting a couple of months before giving my review, and I am still getting acquainted with the camera.  I have not used it for videos, nor have I tried every mode setting.  However, I have used it extensively for still photographs, including close-ups, and am very pleased with the ease of use and quality of the photographs.I did have to get a new (inexpensive) card reader, as the built in slot of my older computer would not read the SDHC card. My next purchase will be an additional battery pack.As it turned out, it wasn't such a bad thing that I tripped over a curb,  and my old Olympus digital camera took the full brunt of the fall onto the concrete! This camera was a fraction of the price I paid for the old one, and I love the red color!""
"20111018","5.0","The camera that meets my needs","*** ALERT: This is NOT a technical review. ***I spent almost a year reading about different point-and-shoot digital cameras.Talked to a few professional photographer friends for their suggestions and input.Had a few cameras on one of my Amazon wishlists for a while before removing them after a couple of months because I didn't feel the same way about them after the time lapse.Tinkered with a few point-and-shoots at every electronics store I found myself in.Two weeks ago the list got narrowed down to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH25 and the Nikon Coolpix S8100. Back to an electronics store we went. I struggled with the menu on the Nikon, then it dawned on me that what I really wanted in a camera was simplicity without too much of a compromise on features. When I picked up the Lumix DMC-FH25, I liked it instantly. The locations of all the buttons felt right. The flash was not in the way. Without access to a user guide at the store, I pressed each button and figured out what its purpose was. The husband glanced through a few of the MANY available shooting modes and was pretty impressed. I ordered the camera from Amazon a few days later.This camera is perfect for my needs. I don't want to be a professional photographer. I don't take pictures to enter them into contests. I don't intend to decorate our home with poster-size reprints of landscapes. I don't mind at all that the Lumix DMC-FH25 doesn't have a lot of room for manual maneuverability. I do like -- very much at that -- that this camera was easy to learn (with a little help from the husband because I got impatient, lol). I am excited about the shooting modes (the one named 'Food' made me laugh out loud)! I also like that a simple description scrolls across the bottom of the LCD screen when you select each shooting mode, so you know what the mode does best. I like that it's small and it fits comfortably in my small hand. I am also pleased with how quickly pictures are taken and stored so I can move on to the next shot (I ordered Transcend's Class 10 8GB SDHC card with this camera).There are SO MANY digital cameras out there. If you want something simple with a few bells and whistles but will not frustrate you with a steep learning curve, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH25 is worth considering.UPDATE on 11/25/2011: Still enjoying this little powerhouse of a point-and-shoot digital camera after a month of use. Experimented with Normal picture mode to an extent and decided my photography skills are simply nothing to write home about, so I switched to iAuto mode full-time. Uploaded two pictures taken yesterday (Thanksgiving) and today in the image gallery for this camera. The Thanksgiving picture is the one of the coffee mug and flowers. The other picture is of our Lab/Shepherd who was just trying to take a nap in the sunlight that poured into our kitchen.Video-taking with this camera is also easy to manage. Yes, you cannot zoom in or out while shooting the video. Some may find this an annoyance, while others will not be hindered. I have taken two 30-second videos with this camera so far and the playback quality is excellent. The camera's mic also picks up the volume of chatter in the video more than capably. Color reproduction is sharp and vibrant as well.""
"20111017","5.0","Very satisfied","Fast delivery, excellent camera. I have been very happy with my purchase of this camera. It takes very pretty, detailed photos and is lightweight. The battery is a flat rechargeable battery and it comes with the charger.""
"20111015","5.0","Great camera","It is not quite the camera I wanted to buy, but it is $200 cheaper. For the price it takes good quality pictures. The macro option works great. The macro-zoom is alright when you need it, but it does add some blur over taking a regular macro mode picture. Movie quality is decent as long as there is enough lighting, the camera doesn't provide any for movies. It does still adjust for too much light in movies though, and very well although it has a slight delay.The sensor size is a bit small, but it is the same as all pocket cameras in this price range. You can't adjust zoom while shooting a movie clip. Also flash will basically always go off indoors when on auto, even if there is plenty of light and the flash will just make it look worse. You basically have to manually set it off if you want it off indoors, which is easy to do but still annoying. iISO is nice, but doesn't always use the best option indoors. Sometimes it will use 800 and the picture will look too bright from flash, and then when manually set to 400 the same picture will look perfect.If you don't need to zoom while taking movies then this is a great choice. If you have a higher budget look into larger sensor sizes and go with a more expensive camera if you really want the best quality pictures.""

"20111012","5.0","Better than all my friend's cameras!","I went to Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park recently and used my camera for the first time.My pictures turned out WAY BETTER (more vivid, colors were true to life) than my frien's cameras (they had a Kodak and a Canon, same size and style). My camera was the only one that captured the redness of the canyons. The pictures on my friends' cameras were all faded yellow and not red!!! This camera is also easy to use. Even a dummy like me can figure most of it out!!The only complaint I have is that I could not telephoto the lens for the videos. But I am not deducting any stars because maybe I just don't know how to do it yet.Now one of my friends is wanting to buy it! She saw the difference and was impressed! Me too!!""
"20111011","5.0","AMAZING CAMERA!!!","This camera has really impressed me!In the past I had a really old sony cyber shot that work ok but never did a great job has I've always wished. I've seen how Canon Power Shot work, delivering pictures that have great colors and focus very well, with no blur at all. However the price of the Power Shot, when I was comparing cameras, were way higher than this Panasonic lumix. They offered less MP (14 MP and 12 MP vs 16 MP) and just half of the zoom (4x vs 8x). So, in terms of features and price, between Canon and Lumix, the Lumix is a better option.The intelligent auto mode works GREAT as a 'point and shoot', it has a very fast shutter speed! and focus great!. If you want to play more with the features like amount of light or enhance colors, the Lumix has already options to make it even easier like 'candle light' mode, 'food' mode, 'sunset' mode, etc, and they work very well. Also it has a panoramic mode that helps to make nice panoramic shoots although it doesn't acoplate the pictures itself.I also have to say that if you don't have basic knowledge of how to manipulate the menus of any point and shoot camera (like my old sony cyber shot), it could take just a few days to discover everything that this camera can do, but when you do you will be amazed! also the Optical Image Stabilizer works great! but you have to pay attention on have it ON, otherwise it won't work, of course!And last but not least, My brother and a friend, both professional photographers, each own DSLR cameras, they both agreed that the lenka lenses have the best quality in the market wich the lumix has.Finally, I always wanted a point and shoot that would allow me to 'play' as a professional photographer and take interesting and nice pictures. This camera has done that and more.So, in summary, I would totally recommend this camera, beyond expectations!""

So far the included software is easy to use and allows you to edit the 'bad' shots so that they look good.After over 200 pictures I have nothing but good things to say about this camera.""
"20111004","4.0","Nice camera for the money...if you don't pay retail.  Wish it zoomed while taking video...","The Amazon price is $60 cheaper than places like Staples, and I think it's reasonable for what you're getting.It's probably the easiest digital camera I've ever used.  The interface is simple and straight forward, and it gives you descriptions of each function along the way.  Focus is excellent and fast compared to my old camera, as well as the zoom feature which is pretty powerful for such a small camera.  Picture quality is decent and images almost always come out sharp.  Taking pics in extremely low light conditions may require an adjustment or two since they sometimes look grainy.My only real complaint is video mode.  24 frames per second in HD mode is pretty low compared to the cheap Flip HD 60 frames per second.  I recorded part of a TV program on my plasma as well as video game clips and it had a flicker in HD mode, whereas in SD mode with 30 frames per second it looked perfect. I'm not sure why they couldn't have made HD mode at least 30 fps.  Also, as others mentioned, you can't zoom in or out while shooting video.  If you're looking for this feature with higher frames per second, look into one of the higher end Canon point and shoot models.  They're a little more expensive, but I sort of wish I spent the extra money for these features alone.  It still won't replace a good camcorder, but it's nice to have an efficient all in one device.This camera also doesn't include video editing software like Flip cameras where you can shorten or splice clips.  It says Super LoiLoScope is on the CD, but it's only a link to purchase the software for 70 bucks!  I found it bizarre and ridiculous to feature the software's name on the CD if it's only a link to download and pay for it.Bottom line, if you only have a $150 budget or less to spend on a camera and need something simple and effective, this is a good buy.  If video is going to be a priority, save up a little more and get a Canon.""
"20110923","4.0","Where's my case?","I purchased a previous Lumix model which I liked, but lent it to my son who dropped it in Turkey. Now it has spots in the zoom.  Not thrilled with that quality, but liked the camera so I decided to try Panasonic one more time and bought this one.Why don't my old batteries fit?!  What's with Panasonic.  Make cameras to sell batteries?! Like HP with ink cartridges.  I really hate that kind of marketing.  Why so expensive?  Probably my last Panasonic because of that.  Or at least make 1 kind of battery that fits all.And where is my case?! No case with this one either.  I had a difficult time finding what exactly was going to ship with the camera.  Glad it at least came with a battery.  I should be able to use any battery that meets the electronic specs. It's just a battery!  Too bad Panasonic.  Did the seller, Quality Photo, remove the case? Otherwise the price was right and delivery on time.""

I've always bought Casios, but I was getting tired of their really bad flash (washes out people's faces really bad).  I didn't want to pay for a Canon and I heard good things about Panasonic Lumix.  This camera is great.  The picture quality is amazing (not like a professional, but still great for what I want) and the flash doesn't wash anyone out.  The only thing that disappoints me is that the battery dies a little faster than I prefer and once the battery starts losing power, the camera takes a lot longer to take a picture.  My old camera was really quick to take pictures and wouldn't leave them blurry, but this camera hesitates when the battery starts getting low and I'll sometimes miss great opportunities.Otherwise, a really great camera.""
"20110920","4.0","Nice little camera to carry around every day","I think this is a great little camera for the price. I was replacing another pocket-sized point and shoot that got bounced one too many times on my bike, and my criteria were size, image quality, and zoom range (especially wide angle, which I'd had on my previous camera). I use a DSLR for 'serious' shooting, but the point and shoot in my pocket gets a lot more use than the DSLR in the camera bag at home! The user interface is pretty intuitive for someone who's used Nikon and Canon point-and-shoots. There are a few oddities like the mechanical switch to go between playback and photo modes, but they aren't a big deal.""

"20110904","2.0","This Could Have Been Such A Good Camera","After my Olympus FE-340 quit working after 3 years (I am still trying to have it repaired), I looked around for a new camera that could take its place as my every day camera. The requirements are for a camera to be small and light enough to fit in my bag with all the other odds and ends, as well have at least 5x optical zoom and a decent picture quality, sensor, start-up/shooting speed and hardware-accessible (not buried in menus) shooting modes. On paper, the Panasonic DMC-FH25S has all of those, and a Leica lens, too.I do want to mention that the lack of a super macro mode is disappointing, but something I was willing to live with. Considering that one of the things I often take pictures of are flowers and other plants in close-up, that is saying a lot about how impressed I was with the specs of this camera.What I have found in a few months of working with this camera is that it is nigh unto impossible to be sure what the camera is thinking at any given time, and as a result  there are many blurred shots, or missed shots simply because the camera is still thinking about the shot, instead of reacting when you press the button.I have been taking pictures for 30 years, and I understand the trade-offs in size and quality very well. From my Nikkormat and Nikon FE to my Fuji S-5000 and beyond, I may not consider myself an expert, but I have a solid background. This camera does not add up to the sum of its parts, and I only wish that I had more of a chance to test it during the return window. Live and learn.""

A combination of features, positive reviews and price seemed unbeatable. Well, we really wanted to love this camera, but it just wasn't meant to be. Our main and pretty much the only issue with this camera is that the colors on the pictures just look way off. We tried Intelligent Auto first, in the variety of settings, and the pictures just didn't look right. What you see in reality (colorwise) is not what you get when you take a picture with this camera. Since Auto mode pretty much failed, I then played with different settings to try and find a good combination. Still no luck. Kept comparing colors to the ones on the pictures by our old Sony and Panasonic was beat time, after time, after time. As others have already mentioned, good P&S cameras will take good pictures in the Auto mode without you having to mess around with settings every time you are in the new surroundings. This camera is not only incapable of that, it can't even take decent pictures when manual settings are used. I'm not a photo professional, but both my wife and I could easily see the difference between our old pictures taken by Sony and the ones taken by this Panasonic camera. It might be a matter of personal taste, but this camera didn't work for us and is being returned to Amazon. The search for new camera continues...""

It isn't too heavy and is ok in a shirt pocket or back pocket providing you remember it is there.There are though many smaller cameras if that is an issue but very few if any with all these features and 16mp. Always remember, these little camera will NOT match the large 35mm Nikons, Canons, Sony fullframe digital cameras. I hear so many who have that expectation, can't and won't happen. But many of these little cameras do a great job at an affordable price for most.Like with anything you buy, do your research, go to a local store to see it, test it, and with Amazon you have 30 days to try it out, if it doesn't meet your expectations return it.

I ended up buying a FinePix (Fujufilm's version of the Coolpix line) 14MP/10X for $139 at Walmart and returning the Panasonic for a refund. Definitely not as many picture mode options, but excellent ISO range and 10x optical zoom with HD video capability? Oh, and the door hinge is made of metal, not two plastic loops.

"20110818","4.0","Great camera, though not good for night time shots","I love the camera because the functions are so easy to use. It is not at all complicated and has lots of different options. I try to take pictures on horseback, and can easily work with the camera while moving. On auto most of the shots were REALLY nice... beautiful shots, I have some that look professional. A few of the shots under auto were fuzzy... you have to be patient and wait a little for the camera to figure out what it needs to focus on under this option. I imagine that the camera was adjusting since I was moving when I took the shot. If you need to take a quick shot of something fast, use normal view or if you want to chose a specific photo option, your target for the photo might move by the time you flip through a couple screens to chose face, animal, candle light, etc as the specific type of photo you want. This is true of most cameras though... and like I said, it is easy to find what you need. I tried video and shots of a deer under regular and night.. with my porch light on it. I could see the deer but the camera couldn't even when I messed with different options. Some pictures under certain options showed the deer some... but not that well at all, I was disappointed with this. The camera has been durable for the month I have had it so far, and the software was easy to use as well.  As far as amazon goes, they sent me an e-mail to pick up the camera at the post office as it needed to be signed for... but it showed up the next day via mail and was left in my mail box.

This camera takes great pictures, they are clear and you get the shot you wanted versus having a delay to take your picture.  I would highly recommend this product for those needing a camera for great, clear, quick pictures with the convenenience of portability and ease of use.  Additionally, I thought the price was great as compared to other cameras of this quality.""
"20110816","5.0","great camera for the money","I recently purchased this camera to replace an old Sony Camera which took AA batteries and drained the juice out of them at the tune of 20 photos per set of batteries.  This Panasonic Lumix has a good little battery that seems to go on performing for a good while between charges.  The photo quality on the camera is very good.  Other folks who have reviewed this camera had less desirable things to say about picture quality, however, I thing they must be comparing picture quality to a far more expensive camera.  I love the size and simplicity of this little jewel.  You cant go wrong for the price.  This camera meets my expectations and I would highly recommend the product to others.""
"20110813","5.0","Awesome camera!","This is a great little camera. The picture quality is fantastic, it's easy to use, it's small, and it's not too pricey. I did a lot of looking around for digital cameras, and I'm very pleased I picked this one!""

"20110810","5.0","LOVE this camera!!","I LOVE my new Panasonic Camera. I have been looking for a small camera that will fit in my pocket yet take great pictures and after a lot of research I found it! I highly recommend this camera. One of my biggest pet-peeves with most cameras is the slow shutter speed. I know that to get perfectly fast shutter speed you really need to invest in a professional camera but I have to say this Panasonic has great shutter speed! I have three very active kids and I manage to get about 90-95% of the pictures that I want with this camera. I bought it right before our recent vacation to the beach and was so pleased with how it worked. Cloudy skies, bright sun, indoors, outdoors, it took great pictures in all environmental conditions. It is a breeze to use also. After charging the included battery with the included battery charger, I just started shooting. I hope to eventually read the manual to see if I am missing any info that may come in handy but for now, it works just as I need it to. My only complaint is that I cannot figure out how to zoom in/out while taking a video (after reading the manual I might find out how...but really a very minor complaint overall). One of my favorite features is what I call the 'quick zoom' button. Push the button once and the camera quickly zooms x8, push it again and it zooms to full optical zoom, push third time and it quickly goes back to no zoom. Great feature! If you are looking for a great little camera that will take great photos this is it!""
"20110810","4.0","Quite pleased","Pros:- small camera that fits easily into a pocket.  A true go anywhere camera- love the intelligent auto mode.  Don't even have to tell it I want to shoot in macro mode, it figures it out and switches automatically.  Same with portraits.- Very good quality images for a 16MP point and shoot even at full size magnification.Cons:- as other have noted the battery could last longer.  It's a 600MaH battery and an extra one from Panasonic is $30-$50.  Fortunately if you search Amazon for 'Wasabi Power Battery for Panasonic NCA-YN101G ' you will find a replacement with twice the capacity for around $10.  Why buy an extra Panasonic battery when for ten bucks that one battery will last as long 2 Panasonics?  Older reviews indicate there are no 3rd party batteries that will work in this camera, but that is not true any longer.- It's a 16MP camera with a tiny image sensor so at full magnification there is a lack of sharpness that is very noticeable (at full magnification of the image) when shooting in less than ideal conditions.  This isn't the fault of this camera, every point and shoot camera has a tiny image sensor and 16mp is too high for those sensors to record every pixel accurately.  In ideal, outdoor conditions and in some cases with the flash close up they look very good though.  For those who will never print at larger than 10x14 or only display at greatly reduced resolutions (such as on monitor or HD TV) this is a non issue.  Do not think reducing from 16MP to 10MP (this camera allows this) will change the lack of clarity at full magnification as it can't.  It's still the same sized image sensor, just not using all of the area.  If you want a camera for large prints, choose lower MP in point and shoot or go DSLR for it's larger image sensors.  I will note that the lack of clarity at full magnification is proportional to how far away the subject is.  For macro shots I am incredibly impressed.  Those are very clear even at full magnification.In between Pro and Con:- the 720P video mode is OK.  The sound is what you would expect, wind noise will be a problem outdoors and voices from far away will sound 'off'.  Same as any video from any camera with an internal mic.  The video quality itself seems fair.  About what I would expect from a camera with a video mode.Overall:Nice little camera for the price.  Nothing about it is revolutionary, but nothing is awful about it either.  The intelligent auto mode is quite slick and a feature I will look for from now on with any point and shoot I consider.""
"20110809","2.0","Bad quality photos","I bought this camera because of the great reviews.  It has some nice features, as do all the cameras in this class, but the quality of the photos is lacking.  Maybe I'm spoiled because I currently have a Canon SX100 IS that takes beautiful pictures, but I've been using digital cameras for over ten years and have not had another that takes bad pictures except for another Lumix that I purchased because of the zoom and good ratings.  I also did not keep that one.  One more sour taste was the $33.00 it cost to return this camera.  I am done with Panasonic.""
"20110808","5.0","The best picture quality possible with a point and shoot","Hi,I was a little hesitant buying a Panasonic camera at first, simply because Panasonic is not the biggest name in Camera industry. But I am glad I made this purchase. It has so many options for the price. One great thing about this camera is that its picture quality under low light conditions is really good. Generally with other cameras if you take a picture in dark with flash on, the things close by become bright and you get an almost black background. With this camera, somehow I did not have that problem. The light was spread evenly and I was able to capture exactly what I wanted.Another important factor here is the 16 MP. You will know the difference immediately. I viewed the pictures that I took recently on my 47' HD TV and even on full screen, there was not a single blur photo (of about the 1000 I took on my trip).The only drawback I could find is that each picture is about 8 MB, which means you at least need to get a 8 GB memory card if not more.All in all, highly recommended.""

"20110805","5.0","Awesome Camera","I REALLY enjoy this camera. Let me start off by saying that I am really just a point and shoot kind of guy, I am NOT a professional photographer by any degree. This camera is easy to use, has long distance zoom, and takes really crisp photos. It is also much cheaper compared to models from other companies supposedly on its level. Finally, it has an auto function that adjusts itself to whatever setting you're in, to take the best possible photos it can; I keep it on this setting and it works great. You can also record videos as well. If you are looking for a simple camera that takes quick and nice crisp photos without hassle, this is for you.""
"20110805","4.0","Not the best battery life","Love this camera, but it has a pretty short battery life.  Also doesn't have color stitch, which I wanted to play around with.  Does have many other settings, and really like the pictures that are produced.""
"20110802","5.0","Lumix DMC-FH25A - Great little camera for the money!!!","I purchased this 'blue jewel' on sale for $130 from Amazon and would have paid more, if I would have known how easy it is to use and still get great pictures!!! Set it to Intelligent-Auto and forget the rest!!! It will pick one of the 6 most used settings when it senses a close-up (macro) or landscape for scenery, etc. You can also choose your most used setting and store it in My Scene. It is pretty small and I thought that might be a problem for shooting good pix and holding it steady, but not an issue. You can definitely put this baby in your pocket or purse and forget about it, until you need it. You won't be sorry, if you pick one of these great little cameras up. Get a Class 10 SD card for it and you're also ready to shoot good HD video, as well. Make sure when setting it up, to choose the highest color and sharpness settings and the rest is taken care of in Intelligent-Auto. The Auto zoom lens on it is just great. Goes from 1X to 10X by just pushing a button or you can manually zoom, as well. It takes as good or better pictures than my $250 Kodak Z1015-IS, which I also love!!! The image stabilization is great even when zoomed. For ease of use and great pictures and nice bright, self adjusting LCD viewfinder, this little jewel can't be beat for the money! Also remember, it has a Leica lens (enough said)!!!""
"20110730","5.0","Great camera for the price","This camera is very easy to use. The zoom is amazing for the price of the camera. A very good point and shoot with an excellent price. It is easy to use right out of the box, nothing too difficult, and small enough to put in your pocket to have on the go.""
"20110729","5.0","Outstanding Product!","I don't offer too many reviews, but this one was worth the effort. If you are looking to purcase a point and shoot, the Panasonic DMC-FH25 is probably the best camera for the money. I did quite a bit of research and was taken by the 8x Zoom and 16.1 MP. And it wasn't much more money than those cameras with fewer megapixels and features!  It's easy to use - whether you are taking close-ups, or panoramic shots, the controls are intuitive and handy. With flash, without flash, macro, zoom... it's really just a few simple clicks and your taking great shots. Right out of the camera with no touch up the photos are well balanced and accurate.(I've uploaded some of the shots on the Panasonic DMC-25K page above.) I didn't even bother to read the manual, I was too excited to start playing with the 16.1 Mega Pixels!  :)  I've seen some reviews where the reviewer was less than enthusiastic about a feature or two... these are probably the kinds of people that complain about everything!  They probably should have purchased a DSLR and been done with it!  My guess is they'd find something to complain about THAT too. I digress... The fact is, for the money, I'm really pleased and happy with this purchase. The only thing I need to do is read the manual and I'll be all set. Oh, one other really fun feature that I found accidentally... When I hooked the camera up to an HDTV, (with included cable), there is a slide show function that has MUSIC built in!! Five or so different songs that play in the background while you watch the images fade and slide across the screen.  That is a really nice touch Panasonic!  It should tell you how much thought went into the design of this Lumix.  Thanks for reading!!  :)""

Everything works well and is convenient.  I like the switch instead of a button to turn the camera on. It is easier to find when you pull it out to snap a picture. Very happy so far.""
"20110727","5.0","exceptional lens","I bought this camera in large part because of the Leica lens. I've used it on a dozen occassions and the picture quality is superb - razor sharp clarity and snappy contrast. I was a photojournalist many years ago, a dinasaur wedded to multiple cameras and lenses, and a variety of films, filters, exposure and color temperature meters. This is my first venture into the digital camera market after a long hiatus. I'm still experimenting with the various automatic settings, but the camera has enough versatility to make it simple to use, while still allowing a measure of creativity. Time will tell whether its durability matches its picture quality. But for now, it serves my purposes and I've got no complaints. I'd certainly recommend it for the casual user.""
"20110726","5.0","Beautiful color","Ordered this point and shoot camera from Amazon after reading various reviews on different sites. I'm not a photographer and so was looking for something with motion stabilizer and a good zoom feature. Also something light and with a rechargeable battery. This camera fit my criteria and several people who reviewed it said they were semi professional photographers and they recommended it except for the lack of a view finder, which none of the cameras in this price range had anyway. I'm very happy with this camera because the color is vibrant and all my shots are sharp. My brother noticed it has a Leica lens which seemed to impress him. I did press the zoom button by accident twice but now that I am more familiar with the camera that has not been a problem.""
"20110726","5.0","So happy","After reading the reviews on Amazon and on the web, I decided to buy this camera to replace my 5 yr. old Canon Elf. I am not a big camera person, I like to have a good small camera to take on vacations.  I have to say, I got such a great deal through Amazon ($125) for this camera. The color and quality of the picture is far better than my Canon. I especially love the zoom, something that I had with my previous camera, but the Lumix, is by far so much better. Closeups are beautiful too! I love the camera and can't wait to take it with me on vacation.""

"20110724","4.0","Great little camera for photo, okay for video.","Firstly, let me say this is a great little camera for the money. Photos are sharp, macro photos are nice. Outdoor photos are incredible, provided you have enough light. Takes about 250 photos a charge as advertised, however videos will eat the battery almost twice as much. The camera can take 720p videos, fine with that.Heres the catch, the camera cannot zoom when you're taking videos, no optical, no digital.Other than the no-zoom-video problem, it's a fine camera for photos. If video is your priority, you're better off looking somewhere else.""
"20110723","5.0","Great little Point and Shoot","I bought this camera about two weeks ago to have a pocket size camera that takes good pictures. Granted it isn't a SLR, but that isn't what I wanted. It takes very sharp, clean, crisp photos and much faster than a more expensive camera that I own. I'm very pleased with the quality for the price and would recommend it to anyone wanting a point and shoot without all the BIG bells and whistles.""
"20110722","2.0","Disappointed","I needed a pocket size point and shoot with basic features for under $200. I really tried to compare features, reviews, etc for my new camera from numerous websites. While the FH25 had less reviews than the other Sony / Canon cameras in its class it generally had no negative reviews. I normally go with Canon but I had read good things about the Lumix / Leica lens. I took the camera on a recent trip to Yosemite to test it out. I took 686 pictures mostly outdoor and a few in low light / sunset. It seemed like the Intelligent Auto feature always selected landscape even for pictures with a lot of motion which left the final image blurred (waterfalls). I also kept having to decrease the white balance because the pictures / details were too washed out in the auto mode. When I returned home to look at the end results on a bigger screen I was completely disappointed. The colors looked saturated and most if not all of the images look either grainy or soft. While my previous Canon A720 lacked the megapixels, features, etc when I compared the pics of my last trip to Yosemite the Canon images beat the Lumix images hands down. I tried to go cheap and lost out, maybe I just got a dud? I am sending it back. I still think I did enough homework and based on the other reviews / research.? Im not sure but I think I am going to plunk down more money to get a higher end Canon. Out of 686 images maybe 100 were acceptable and that is a terrible percentage of acceptable images.""
"20110721","4.0","Panasonic DMC-FH25K","Overall, I am pleased with this camera. It's relatively 'idiot proof' to use in automatic settings and takes good, high quality pictures. About the only shortcoming I've found is the lack of an internal program or setting to format a memory card. For this, you must download and install onto your computer from Panasonic a program called SD Formatter V. 2.0. Panasonic makes no mention of this program, or alternative methods of formatting a memory card, in any of the literature that comes with the camera. I stumbled upon it by accident in a Google search. Despite this, I think this is a good camera for the price.""

I have this camera in violet and love the color. This is a light weight camera with LOT'S of options and setting's,I've only used a few and am very happy. I have a Macbook Pro and the disk that comes with it includes the manual and was easy to put in and read.

"20110718","3.0","Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH25","I did a lot of research before deciding to buy this camera.  I like the size, ease of setting, general feel and great reviews.  The one thing I don't like is the picture quality.  I bought my first digital camera in the year 2000.  It was a 460 X 380 with minimal settings and not the best quality pictures, but I have had several cameras since then and have not had a complaint about the pictures except for one other Panasonic Lumix.  I have now sent both back for the same reason - poor quality pictures.  I really wanted this camera to work, but I couldn't get past the fuzzy photos.  My recommendation is if picture quality is important to you, don't buy this camera.""
"20110718","5.0","Wonderful little camera","I'm not a professional photographer. I enjoy the outdoors and wanted a small camera that I could point and shoot.  I am particularly fascinated by cloud formations.  I am thrilled with the sharp photos I am getting with this camera.  The 16 megapixels allows for a lot of detail.  The mode button is handy, the viewfinder screen is nice and large, and the camera is very forgiving for folks like me who have a hard time holding a camera completely still.  I love the battery charger which comes with the camera; it is small and easy to just pop my battery in and charge it overnight.  The battery charge lasted me over a three day period.  I don't use video, so I can't comment on that aspect.  The price here on amazon is very good.  I've seen this camera for over $200 on other sites.  It is a snap to transfer the photos onto the computer.  I don't use the display on my television, so I can't comment on that, either.  The camera case which comes with it easily attaches to my belt, and it is so light I hardly know it's there.  What I like most about the camera is how easily it focuses, especially when using the zoom feature.Overall, I love this camera!  If you are a casual photographer, then this camera is the one you want.  I researched digital point and shoot cameras for hours before deciding on this one, and I am sticking with it.""
"20110715","1.0","returned for refund. poor quality... do not recommend","I returned this for a refund due to a small smudge brown spot in the LCD display.. while taking a picture of an art project I kept noticing a faint brown spot near the center of the LCD display of this camera... I thought it was from what I was taking a picture of but could not see anything.. then I looked closer I saw the spot is from the LCD... again I was not concerned until this brown smudge showed up in the taken photos! Unacceptable!I cleaned the lens but still the smudge was there. I do not know what the smudge was but returned camera for a refund which amazon accepted. If this camera did not have this problem I still would be underwhelmed overall. I have been out of the market for a camera for about 5 years.. (last camera was a Samsung compact 5mp) and maybe my expectations are high for what is available in 2011. I bought this Lumix based on the specs of 16 mega-pixels but I found the LCD display just so-so.. with so much info going in, it's really unnecessary to even go to 16mp on such a small lens... plus my fault was not researching the video format which this has a jpeg movie format...who wants that? This camera is designed for not just amateurs but more like 5th graders.. on top of that this camera has a ultra-fine delicate feel.. cheap china plastic i am guessing.. it's so fragile feeling it might as well be a disposable! There is nothing I personally liked about this camera... After this mistake I am re-thinking what I need... You really need to think twice at what you want in a camera..  Trying to go on the cheap while buying a name brand in Panasonic got me nowhere... do your research first... pay more for what you want or you will be disappointed like I was... 16mp means nothing... it's just the camera makers showing off... look at how many mega-pixels we can cram in this little thing.. but it's not important.. during my research I found a camera that last year was a 14mp camera and this years model they went down to 12mp.. why? because 14mp is to much for the lens.. if you want to print at 14mp you cant and have to downgrade the file in the computer anyway.. so why bother?... the camera I am looking seriously at is the Kodak EasyShare Max Z990 (2011). it's $270.. that is more than I wanted to pay.. but if your above average photographer you need to pay more for a better camera.. this Panasonic has zero pros for me... I am sorry I bought it and thought 16mp is all that matters... then why did Kodak go down in mega-pixels? Think before you buy.  My advise is, even if your a total novice this Lumix has little to offer. There is I am sure better point and shoot cameras out there. No way do I recommend this on any level.The Kodak EasyShare Max Z990 is in my cart and I am sure to try it... hope it works out and will post a review... regards camera shoppers.""

My previous camera was a sony cybershot that only lasted 2 years, which is why I wanted to try a different brand. It had 12 megapixels but took much clearer pics.

EVERY other digital camera I tried had a significant lag time between when you press down on the button and when it snaps the picture.

Was very dissapointed since this camera had one of the better reviews on amazon....so, I returned it and bought a cannon at best buy. Takes awesome pics, but a little bulky. I also just purchased a Sony(I think), that can fit in my purse. Haven't gotten it yet, but hopefully the pics turn out better!""

Takes pictures fairly quickly too - not too much loading time after taking a shot.  Haven't had any problems with it.I guess if you're used to a cybershot camera then it may be mildly annoying to get used to the different interface but I'm used to it by now so I don't find it an issue.  It's really not that difficult to figure out.""

"20110629","5.0","excellent camera with an incredible Leica lens","I have been using this camera for about a month and it is fantastic! I have taken photos using both theautomatic intelligence mode, where the camera does all the settings, and the My Picture mode, where youcan choose options such as ISO, flash settings and so forth. I have also tried various optical zoom lengths.Some of the pictures were taken in less-than-optimal conditions, like in the rain and under fluorescent lights.All of them came out great, sharp and with excellent color. I have noted several  reviews that mentionproblems with color rendition. All of my images have been taken using the 'Natural' setting, which isone of several 'color bias' settings. It is worth noting that the color bias selected will be used evenwhen the iA mode is selected and, before I realized that, I had some pictures with terrible colorbecause I had left the camera set to 'Vivid'. I have not yet used Macro but have tried various opticalzoom lengths and have not had any of the problems with poor focus or decreased clarity, also mentionedin some reviews. I have posted several images. The 4 kitten pictures were taken under fluorescent lightand the leaves and flower were taken in the rain. All were done using the highest resolution setting,automatic white balance and 'natural' color setting and ISO 200. The camera was hand-held. No editingwas done except for cropping of the images of the white kitten (the full image pre-crop is also shown)and the book/leaves. Both were tightly cropped to the center portion of the image, and remain verysharp and detailed. I am especially impressed by the white kitten, where multiple tones of white can beseen.  I was concerned at first by the lack of a detailed manual instead of just a CD and I originallyplanned to print out the manual after loading it on my computer, so I could have carry-along instructions.However, after going through the manual, most of the settings are easy to find and use and I may onlyprint a couple of the more difficult to find directions, like how to format an SD card.  This is a wonderfulcamera which takes excellent pictures and I am very glad I purchased it, despite the negative reviews.Additional information: I have now been using this camera for 7 months and still love it. The onlycriticism I have is in regard to the lever used to zoom; it is small, with a narrow range of motionand it can be difficult to stop at the exact distance you want.  It is a minimal problem but onethat can interfere with my photographing my favorite subjects; kittens waiting for Forever Homes at theSPCA. I have also discovered that this camera has a surprisingly powerful flash that can 'wash out'pictures if I am not careful. I prefer natural light pictures, so I keep the flash turned off forboth IA and normal picture settings and set the sensitivity at 200 or 400. Even in low light, thepictures look very good and I have posted a couple on this site as illustrations.""
"20110629","4.0","Very impressed with the camera, ease of use, & images. High quality Leica lens.","Received mine yesterday and very impressed so far. I am a retired photography teacher, also have a nice Kodak z-series point & shoot, and a Canon Xsi dSLR. Bought this to have a nice pocket camera to carry. Setup was easy, there are plenty of options, features, and modes. But most owners will probably use it in the 'intelligent auto' mode where the camera figures everything. It has a high quality Leica lens. I am amazed at how close I can shoot, without using the zoom, and even with the flash firing. This camera just came out in January, 2011, so the required lithium-ion rechargeable battery is expensive at $49.95 at this time. Generics will not work, I have read, because like many companies, the battery contains a computer chip which tells the camera if the battery is legit, sorry. I'm sure prices will come down on the battery, and a second battery is not needed, at least at first. It takes very high quality pictures. You can adjust settings, but even at the best image quality setting this takes over 1200 images to an 8GB SD memory card. A Class 6 is recommended if you plan to shoot HD 720 video. I highly recommend this camera. UPDATE: Months later I am still very happy with this camera. In fact, I tend to use it most often of the 3 good digital cameras I own. I mainly like its small size which can be slipped into a pocket in a thin camera pouch, and automatically great pictures. One thing I have noticed, and that is sometimes floating dust in the shot will end up as a round circle in the picture. This does not happen often, usually only happens in lightly dusty areas, and according to the company is normal. There's nothing really wrong with the camera. I can live with it, and dust spots like these can be corrected using photo software most of us have. Additional UPDATE 12/2011: I still love this camera but have had one additional problem. Sometimes when I take flash pictures in a darker area, or of a dark object, i.e. mens suit, the black does not photograph as black. It has 'noise' made up of multiple color pixels. This does not happen often, and I think it may be a problem of the flash. It doesn't perform like my Canon digital Rebel XSi, though, but it's a much simpler camera, small, and very easy to use. I do still like it even with it's occassional problems.""
"20110629","5.0","Very nice!","I got this camera as a backup to my Panasonic DMC-FZ35 to keep in my car.I found that I use it more than my larger camera because it's always near, and it's small enough to carry around with out lugging something big.It takes decent pictures and the zoom is better than most of this type.Being small, it is missing some of the tricks and functions of its larger siblings.Although the brighness of the LCD is adjustable I find it difficult at times to see in bright sunlight.On my other cammera, I can switch to the viewfinder in bright sunlight.I had wanted a black version, but ended up with the siver model because it was considerably cheaper, which doesn't seem logical.Not a deal breaker, and I actually like the looks of the silver version.It does not come with a memory card, just internal memory.I got an 8GB SD card for less than $15 on Amazon.And a case from Case Logic for $7.""
"20110625","5.0","Nice for the price","Got this camera to use when I am not really in the 'photographer' mood - something light and easy to carry.

So how could something so small be all that great?When the camera arrived the next day I found out.This thing does everything and does it well!I did side by side test shots in different light conditions and it performed much better than I hoped it would. There is not a whole lot you can get for $140. This was money well spent. Panasonic has out done itself. And yes it is TINY. But that's what is so good about it.

"20110616","2.0","DMC-FH25R Review","Been using it now for about three weeks and am disappointed with the picture quality.  With the settings set at full 16MP and full auto, the pics come out kind of hazy, not sharp at all and the colors seem washed out.  I was upgrading from a Kodak 5MP Easyshare camera that was on it's way out and I have to say that the old Kodak took much better quality pics, sharper and more vivid colors than the new Panasonic.  A point and shoot for me must take great pics on the auto setting, I don't want to have to fiddle with the adjustments because pics are usually taken quickly and on the go, thats the whole purpose of a point and shoot.  The camera itself is solidly built, the screen looks great and the size is perfect, but all that means nothing if the pics don't come out great.  Sorry to say this one is going back and will be replaced with a new Kodak.""
"20110615","5.0","Great Camera","Lot's of positives for this camera:Advertised as 8x optical zoom but that's video. It's 10x in photo mode, 22.5x if you employ the digital zoom as well.16.1 mp is amazing for a camera in this price range. I actually used the max digital zoom and still got good resolution photos.About 2 dozen scene modes (portrait, beach, sunset, etc) that work well and are easy to select. Text scrolls across the screen explaining its use as you you move from mode to mode.Very easy to use. About 1/2 hour with the manual and camera and you can understand and begin using all the features.Image stabilization sems very effective. I shot every thing hand held even at max zoom and liked the results.Great battery life. I chrged it 1x on a week vacation but that was just in case. Could have gone all week with 100s of shots.Like most digitals the camera has very little built in memory so you need to buy a memory card. I chose the PNY 16 GB that has more room than I think I'll ever need.One negative this camera shares with most point and shoots: you miss a viewfinder in very bright sunlight. But the screen is bright enough to make it manageable so I still rate this very highly.""

At another where lighting was good, pictures were excellent.The batteries are expensive, but I think I can get away without buying a spare. This seems to do well holding a charge. At the reunion, I did two full days of shooting without bothering to recharge at night, and the charge was still good. Recharge is done quite quickly.""

"20110611","4.0","Good Quality for the Price!","This camera works well if you're just really looking for a point and shoot camera. Like other reviewers say, the video is not zoom enabled. The image gets noisier the higher the optical zoom you go. If you are good at tuning the brightness of the camera, then you should be able to take really good pictures with it. The best thing about this camera is that it has the 'Intelligent' feature where it would detect difference scenes (i.e. night scene, pet scene...) so that for an amateur camera user, it would be very easy to be used. However, the camera doesn't have the gyroscope feature. All in all, it's a great starter camera for anyone.""
"20110609","4.0","Very nice camera","I've had this camera for a little over a week now. I found it very easy to learn how to use, and it's enabled me, in a relatively short period of time, to grab some pretty nice images -- if I must say so myself. Normally I write long, verbose reviews. This time, I'll just let the 4 sample photos I uploaded above speak for themselves. And for the FH25. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I'm certainly no professional photographer. But I've dabbled in photography for a number of years, and I was very pleased with the results after having only worked with the FH25 for a week.(NOTE: I will be replacing the FH25 with the Lumix ZS8, but it's not a knock on the FH25, it's more a matter of preference: larger zoom (16x vs 8x), the 3' monitor (vs the 2.7'), the manual control options/settings, more reasonably priced replacement batteries and chargers, center position tripod mount, 2 'My Scenes' vs 1, and the ability to zoom in video mode -- all available on/for the ZS8. But the FH25 really got me hooked on Lumix cameras. It's somewhat smaller and lighter than the ZS8, which I see as a plus, and for the price, it's a great, capable, very user friendly camera. In terms of the ergonomics, I actually prefer the FH25. I like the Mode button on the back, rather than the Mode dial on the top. I got very good at switching back and forth without ever taking my eyes off of the screen. With the ZS8 I have to look up on the top and fiddle with the dial, making it a slower, more cumbersome process. I also prefer the placement of the tiny top speaker on the FH25 compared to the ZS8. It's almost a guarantee that everyone's left index finger is going to be blocking the ZS8's speaker. It's literally RIGHT THERE where you place your finger. It's not that big of a deal, it's just annoying. There's plenty of real estate up there; it could have easily been moved over a couple of inches. At first I thought I'd set the volume of the 'beep' on low, but I hadn't. It sounded low because my finger was covering the speaker.)""
"20110606","5.0","Panasonic DMC-FH25V camera","I liked the camera very much, for the very short time I had it. I had the camera in the case, clipped to my belt with the clip that came with the case.

"20110603","4.0","Good little camera for the $","Have only had it for about a week, but so far, so good. It takes great photos compared to my old Nikon Coolpix which had a ridiculous amount of noise on indoor pics. The body seems a bit awkward to hold, so I'm definitely putting the strap around my wrist. I am concerned that the on/off is a switch - we shall see how that holds up over time. I'm taking this camera on a trip in a couple weeks and can't wait to see how it performs. The blue color is very vibrant. Definitely not a color for the discreet.""
"20110603","5.0","Best Little Camera Ever!","This camera is fantastic! I bought it because a friend asked me what I thought would be a good first digital camera for a beginner around $150.00. When he RAVED about his I decided to get one for myself. I have been using a Lumix DMC-FZ15 since 2004 and have had great success taking thousands of pictures. I thought the new DMC-FH25K would come in handy as a pocket size option. WOW! not only does it take incredible pictures, the VIDEO is superb! And that includes audio, folks! OK it does not have the battery life to take more than 1/2 hour of video, but it is not designed as a full feature video camera. It is a pocket sized snapshot camera. And that it does superb as well. The gobs of preset scene modes cover just about everything I need. The 'Food' setting provides brilliant color on close ups with no flash, and the 'Sunset' setting gave me some breathtaking results. Out here in Arizona, daytime shots can be challenging in the extreme bright sun. No problem with the DMC-FHK. Just choose the 'Beach' scene mode and WOW! I recently took stills and video of an Oath Keepers Memorial Day Event (to honor USMC Jose Guerena in Tucson) and posted the results in a youtube video in less than one hour! [...] AWESOME LITTLE CAMERA! BUY ONE NOW!""
"20110602","4.0","Great camera for price! Needs reinforcements to body!","Overall a great camera for the price. Love the color blue this camera came in. Battery life is good and better than the previous Sony camera I had. The only things that bother me is the exterior build quality. It does not look durable, I'm scared to drop it 6 inches. The battery door and USB door seem very week and not reinforced with any metal plates or anything, also the on and off is a switch and not a button same thing with the preview or camera mode switch. They should of used buttons instead of switches which feel like they'll break or wear after so much usage. Other than that this camera is an amazing performer for the money. And the pictures it produces is top notch. Also there are no accessories available for this camera compared to what the manual states.An extra battery is like $50 bucks which is outrageous. And no generics available. Good camera but fragile. Amazon shipping was pretty quick but the processing is not so quick. Packaging was pretty good though.""

"20110531","2.0","Takes poor pictures quickly","I had been looking for a fast camera that takes decent pictures for a while, and had high hopes for this camera.  While this camera is very fast (shot-to-shot time and flash recycle time are excellent), the images it produced were unacceptable.  When the iAuto mode was used indoors, some of the pictures contained dark rainbow colors (despite the fact that the flash was used).  I also noticed that the colors seemed 'off' (indoor or outdoor pictures), and photos of people looked 'fake' (skin looks like it was smeared).  The camera also had a tendency to raise the ISO level very high to capture photos.  I used the Canon A720is as the benchmark for my testing.  Other than a broken switch and overall slow operation (which prompted my search for a new camera), my Canon A720is still takes excellent pictures.  The indoor pictures taken with my old A720is were far better than the Panasonic.""

"20110530","2.0","disappointed","I am returning my Panasonic Lumix FH25 camera. I know it's at the lower end of the P&S spectrum and brand new, but Panasonic in collaboration with Leica produces a generally above average camera at any price. I own serious cameras and take pictures every day. I ordered this one because the price was reasonable and it seemed to be a nice little snapshot camera for occasions, especially an upcoming visit with family. Panasonic's press release and specs sounded perfect. After three days of continual use and several hundred photos on every setting imaginable, I am sorely disappointed. Why?1. LCD screen acts like a mirror in bright light and image can't be seen, even in shade2. macro does not produce a sharp image at any setting3. color saturation is extreme, even with adjustments4. pictures look satisfactory on LCD, but when zoomed in, even once, they quickly deteriorateAny pros? it stops action well when set on 'sports'In my opinion, this little camera (well designed and attractive) has sacrificed sharp images in order to market 16 megapixels. It's not worth even the low price. Sorry, Panasonic, you let me down.""
"20110524","2.0","Very disappointed","I bought this to upgrade from a Samsung BL103 that I bought for $69 at a Wal-Mart Black Friday special a few years ago. The Lumix has a better flash, a better zoom, and better sound when video-recording, but in every other way was equal or inferior to the old Samsung. Images look great on when reviewed on the camera's screen, but look terrible on computer screens or when printed (and I've had them printed at more than one place). Photos look processed, color is odd, and video is full of artifacts. Can't say how disappointed I am, especially after all the glowing reviews the FH20 got. I will be returning this purchase.""
"20110520","5.0","So far so good","I haven't had this camera for very long before writing this (only 1 week), so I'll update in about a month. So far, however, it's exactly what I expected. I was going to get the Nikon Cool Pix, but that had too many bad reviews. So I bought this one. I tested it just once by taking photos INDOORS under flourescent light. Photos came out better than I thought they would. Digital screen is bright, and has settings that even allow you to change the angle of view in case you're holding the camera above your head.The other reason I bought this is the size and ergonomic design. I need a small, decent camera to take around w/ me for misc parties and such. I have another, much better Canon SLR, but that one is big, bulky, heavy, and as such difficult to keep inconspicuous. In the past, when on vacation or in another country, I was often the center of attention when I pulled out the camera or traveled on public transportation. That could be quite dangerous. So, I opted to buy this camera. Has a nice, attractive design, nice blue color, but not so nice that it looks like it's $1000 bucks. And if it's stolen or I'm robbed, I'll be mad, but it's not as if it'll take $1000 bucks to replace! And I could hide it while traveling. It's small enough to put in your pocket. It would bulk up your pocket, but it's much safer than carrying around an SLR around your neck.Some of the cool features is face recognition technology. It actually puts a square around people's faces! It will focus on those faces. That feature I did test and it works. The few photos I took were very clear, focused, color was as true to the real scene as I could tell. And I only used a setting that saves 5m of information.Most features are easy to get to quickly, using the menu buttons and such. There's even a feature that allows you to set a 'normal' scene setting if you know you use it a lot. This allows you to go back to it quickly if in a different scene setting.One con is that some features aren't available depending on the scene you're using. That would be fine, except that it will take a few months of using the camera to really get familiar w/ what you can and can't use depending on the scene setting. The instruction manual is unfortunately on CD-ROM in pdf format, so if you're away from your computer and you need to look up a feature to remind yourself how to use it, you're out of luck.But those are cons I'm willing to live with. I didn't expect this to be as good as my SLR, and indeed it's not. There is no manual focus, for instance, the flash is somewhat limited. But I didn't buy this camera to have manual focus and a good flash. I bought it to be able to hide in my pocket, travel w/ it, get quick, high quality-in-focus pictures, and not worry about replacement value. My initial tests confirmed I can do all of that and even more.So far, so good.""
"20110513","5.0","third time is the charm","The first was a 7.1MP 3x zoom Canon Powershot SD1000.  It took great photos (day and night) but it was slowww and the video was standard not HD.  I traded up (or so I thought) and got a 12MP 5x zoom Sony Cyber-shot W290.  It was sleek and stylish.  The photos were okay (good day photos lousy night photos). I couldn't believe it. A 7.1MP camera was better than a 12MP camera made from Sony! The HD video (720p) was awesome.  I sold it and gave my Powershot away as a gift.  It took me almost a year to decide to get a new camera.  My research paid off.  I originally wanted to get the Lumix FH20 or the Lumix ZR3 but chose this camera only because it was cheaper than the FH20 and I don't shoot too many videos so what's the point of having a camera with AVCHD Lite.  This camera too many may be overkill. 16MP is too much for 'regular' photos (4x6). The zoom is a nice feature for a camera of this class (mid-range). 5x zoom is pretty much the industry standard and sufficient for most people. I like this camera, it satisfies my every need. It has the best features of my previous cameras.  Photos (day and night) are great, HD video is great, and its pretty fast.  I recommend getting a 8GB Class 6 SDHC card the fully enjoy this camera.  I will go on vacation in 3 weeks. I will taking this camera and putting it to the test.  I will update this review later. Wish me luck.""

"20110329","4.0","Finally a decent camera that takes sharp photos","I purchased this because I was very unhappy with the new Canon A3300 that I also purchased just a week before this one. I did extensive photo tests with both cameras because I felt the Canons overall sharpness was bad. Both cameras are 16mp and although i'm a Canon fan I have to say they failed on the A3300. Even with setting custom sharpness, contrast and saturation, the normal straight out of the box settings on the Panasonic were way better.The two big problems with the canon were most photos even bright outdoors had way too much noise. The other problem was no matter what setting and focus type, only the center areas were in ok and i mean ok focus. All four corners of the photos were on the blurry side and that's just unacceptable. Compared to this Panasonic...wow, much better and much sharper. When fully zoomed in there was a bit of noise but its expected. Night shots depending on how you take them also have noise but again depending on how and what you can work around it a bit.There are minor differences with the two cameras like the zoom smoothness was a bit better on the canon and the user interface and menu screens were also a bit better on the canon. Not a deal breaker at all because I'd rather have quality over cosmetic things. The other minor things i found were that the Panasonic has the af assist light very close to the top corner of the camera where you put your fingers. Also the on off and photo/play aren't buttons they are switches which i'm a little worried about breaking so we'll see how they last.One of the biggest differences is that this camera is faster. I found that saving photos is almost instantaneous on the FH25 but on the canon it was about a 4 sec pause to save before you could take another (a 'busy' icon shows up. Most of all the functions on the FH25 are faster and i like being able to grab the camera and take photos quickly.Overall i'm all about quality and sharp photos and this camera does that. If you don't care about the spare battery cost or that the user interface and menus look like 20 years old, i think you'll be happy with this camera.Photos for the most part are well exposed and using the full Ai seem to always come out perfect. There will be a slight bit of noise in certain shots but sharpness is never an issue. The whole thing about higher mega pixels is better isn't completely true, its all about the sensor size. Do some research about that as I did but believe me, this camera really does a great job. I've posted a few sample photos.UPDATE 8-17-11Still loving the picture quality of this small camera. I even tested out the new Canon SX230 and again this FH25 was sharper and photos were exposed better.  The full iAuto setting is amazing and it reallydoes a great job, I've taken photos with it that I will be publishing in my second book next year. That's how good I feel the quality is.Update: there are batteries available for only $10.00 making this camera a great choice.""

The colors are great, the video clarity and color is great and it seems to be built solidly.

"20110307","2.0","I had high hopes, but it's going back","Initially, I was very excited to try out the new Lumix DMC-FH25R.  It came on Friday and I immediately charged the battery so I could put the camera through its paces this weekend.Well, it's Monday and I'm sending it back.In spite of Leica glass on this camera, the image quality, I'm afraid, isn't there.  Pictures taken in low light yield false colors.  For instance, a shot of a red dinner plate came out a strange burnt orange and very oddly distorted.  The flash seems very underpowered, which may well contribute to these odd results.  Other shots looked quite dim and out of balance.As far as build quality goes, I cannot understand why Panasonic would give the camera such a flimsy battery/SD card door.  I know this is a small thing, but for a feature that is meant to be opened and closed often, there should be some structure beyond a small metal pin.  The two Canons and Nikon I've previously owned in compact digital cameras had either metal braces or were intentionally made of a flexible rubbery plastic that had some give to it.  The Panasonic camera, which is very light, just doesn't feel like it will hold up well over time and use.Maybe others will find virtues in this camera, but I, for one, didn't find a whole lot to like.""

He also took a picture of a lake near where he lives.  It was magnificant and captured water color variations, the sun, the mist.  He is having it put on photo quality paper and framing it for me.

I recently took some closeups of flowers in my yard. When I downloaded the pictures to my pc, I could not believe how clear, crisp and vivid the picture was. I saw a lady bug on a flower which I had not seen with the naked eye. Because of it's high mega pixels you can get your pictures made into posters without losing any color, clarity or vividness.

"20120427","5.0","good camera","When my Cannon PowerShot A3100 went Kablooey after being dropped, I went back to using my ancient Nikon Coolpix which is slow as they come and temperamental. So I did some research and found the Panasonic Lumix, which I had always known about. I remembered the commercials and always liked Panasonic's products. I am very pleased with the camera. It is smaller than my older cameras but faster and takes much better pictures. The dial in back is simplistic and the icons are embossed but not in color so are a little hard to see ( so I need to memorize them. ) Still finding my way around this camera, but it all seems quite easy. Best is the zoom lens...very close up and great for product shoots ( Ebay). I think it's a great camera and I hope it lasts me.""

It was cheap....that is about the only good thing about it.  Can't wait to kill this one off so I can go back to a cannon.  oh, and the battery doesn't last very long, I have to charge it about once a week....it does take pretty good action shots, but then again, so did my cannon which didn't have all the other issues.....""

I have a Sony A77 which I dearly love with more lenses than any amateur should have, but I just can't take it everywhere and this little camera I can.This camera delivers rich colors, is responsive with a menu system that is very easy to figure out. If you're a complete newbie to photography, this camera was made for you and if you've been shooting for awhile, you'll appreciate having a camera in your purse that can you can rely on that takes gorgeous photos and is so light, you'll hardly know it's there.""
"20120423","5.0","Overall, very pleased!","Before the birth of my son, I hardly ever took photos and I was perfectly happy with my iPhone camera.  Then my son was born, and I started taking tons of pictures.  When I printed them, they looked terrible.  They were, after all, mostly taken indoors in low light.  That's when I started shopping around and decided to buy this Panasonic FH25k.I have had it for a year and a half now I believe and overall I am very happy with it.  In outdoor lighting, it gives wonderful pictures with vibrant colors.  I take it to the park all the time and I get great action shot of my son riding bugs and playing.  I have also gotten some nice indoor pictures when the lighting is good (lot of sun coming through the windows).  When the lighting isn't good, the flash works well enough to capture the moment.  Without flash, I have gotten some blurry pictures of my now toddler running around.  It is a tad slow too in indoor light, but not so slow that I have really missed anything.  For a point and shoot I think it is great.  I have used other point and shoots and was never happy with them.  I have taken some videos too, and they look pretty good on the computer screen.  I haven't tried them on my tv yet, but this is leaps and bounds better than my phone camera.A couple of minuses, I do get some red eye sometimes, but I can fix that in iPhoto so it isn't a big deal.  I don't like in camera red eye reduction for toddlers.  He isn't going to sit still while the camera shoots light in his eyes.  Also, sometimes while shooting in very bright light outdoors, I get a flare on the screen.  It isn't super often, and it doesn't come through on the pictures, and that was my main concern when I first saw it.  It is a little irritating, but not a big deal really.It does have a lot of options to choose from , with all the different scene modes, and you can change the iso if you feel like getting into it a little more.  I recently decided to buy an entry level dslr, as having this has re-ignited an interest in photography that I had as a teenager.  Even so, this is small enough that I keep it in my purse so I don't miss anything.  Obviously I'm not going to compare the quality of the two, because they are two different animals, but as a mother who wants a small, light, inexpensive carry everywhere camera, I am very pleased.""

Of course, the camera can be adjusted however one wants to their own personal settings but I don't see why since the auto mode takes excellent pictures. I had an Olympus FE 4030 and wanted a camera with better zoom capabilities and megapixels and this camera was up to the challenge. It blows my Olympus out of the water.

I have shot 30+ homes since buying and it is one of the best wide angles for the money. My last one was an Olympus and the lens went crooked and jammed about one month after warranty ran out.

"20120411","4.0","LUMIX FH25 is a sweeet little bugger","I carried around my Canon PowerShot Elph for a long time, and I was always satisfied with the results. On my last trip abroad, I managed to drop it onto a tiled patio and 'pfft!' there goes the Elph.I read a number of reviews on affordable compact point-and-shoot cameras, and what it boiled to was either get another Canon or try out the Panasonic LUMIX FH25. I decided on the Panasonic this time mostly because of the favorable reviews on its zoom capabilities.I have only had the camera for a week, but I am very pleased with the results.  The iA mode provides very good results if you are unsure of what settings to choose, and I really like the ease of changing exposure on the fly. It also has very good stabilization. I am very much looking forward to taking this little bugger on an upcoming trip to US parks Craters of the Moon (ID), Yellowstone (WY), and Garden of the Gods (CO) and really running it through its paces!My two greatest praises: 1) It has WONDERFUL color saturation and loves to play up shadows. This bodes very well for outdoor shots. 2) The price point is great for the quality of camera.My two biggest complaints: 1) Thus far it's the fact that the software which arrived with the camera is just plain lame. 2) The flash is very powerful, more powerful than the one I was used to with my Canon.  This has the undesired effect of washing subjects' faces out a bit indoors. I guess I shouldn't really call that a complaint, since a bright flash is better than a weak one. Perhaps I just need to get accustomed to it better.""

"20120405","5.0","Panasonic DMC-FH25","I have been looking for a camera with a greater zoom for nearly a year. I have a Canon AS 590 IS bought through Amazon which takes excellent photographs, but it only has a 4X zoom. I take indoor, outdoor, low light, wildlife pictures and pictures for a local flea market. I wanted a longer zoom for the wildlife pictures that the Canon could not reach.I looked at cameras with a 10X to 30X zoom from $150 to $400 and read all the customer reviews and all the professional reviews. The pro reviews usually showed pictures taken at full zoom which was very helpful. Any camera I saw in the stated price range has a slight softening to a horrible softening at full telephoto.Last Saturday I was disappointed with all of them for the long zoom shots. I saw a sale flyer for this Panasonic DMC-FH25 at $99, so I looked on Amazon and reviews were extremely favorable. I found a pro review and the zoom shots were the best I had seen. I decided to buy the camera, figuring if nothing else, the zoom was worth $99.I have used the camera all week long and it has been equal or better to my beloved Canon and the zoom is as good as advertized. I have an old oak tree 100 yards behind the house and with the E Zoom button I focused and shot the picture. The photo came out so well I can see the bark pattern on the tree.The camera is very easy to use and with the IA mode (Intelligent Auto) I did not have to do anything but press the shutter button (after pressing half way down to allow the auto focus to lock) and the pictures are great. So far it is the best $99 I have ever spent.Pros: Super easy using IA mode and excellent results (sharp pics)E Zoom one touch button uses 8X optical zoom and digital zoom to make 18x with no visable picture degradation.Exposure levels can be changed by pressing one button on back of the camera. This is great for getting the right exposure on a white flower under a bright sun.LCD on back can be set so you can hold the camera up over your head and still see the screen. This is great if you are behind a crowd but want to take a picture of an event.Quick menu button enables you to make menu changes on the fly to improve light compensation filters.It is super easy shifting from stills to movie mode at 720p. And movies look very good.Battery life is very good. It ran for hours while I accustomed myself with camera features. Battery comes out easily and recharges in an external supplied charger.Camera is very small, yet feels good and looks great.LCD screen has modes to adjust for taking pictures in bright light.Party mode takes great indoor low light pictures.Cons: No manual focus, but then the auto focus works very well.Battery takes over two hours to recharge from a complete drain.Movie mode files are .MOV and need to be converted to .WMV for Windows Media Player. There are ways if you search on the Internet.Software that comes with the camera for picure handling was barely adequate. I just use my Canon software instead.So far those are the only drawbacks. I will update if I find more things good or bad.Update 4-17-2012 The battery is easy to remove and reinstall. It takes just under 2 hours to recharge from zero. The battery and SDcard cover is just a slide on off so no worry about it breaking the plastic. The battery is good for 200 pictures without flash and indoor pictures are good without flash under normal daytime conditions. You can take all your pictures using IA mode if you care to do so. Macro pictures are great. AF Zoom allows you to take a macro from 3 feet away. Indoor pictures usually snap at 400 ISO without a lot of noise.

I also have a FZ28 and love it too, but it is big and heavy compared to this FH25.  The FZ28 takes much better macro pictures and of course the FZ28 has a bit more zoom (18-25).  All in all I would recommend the FH25 to anyone that doesn't try to compare it to a a $300 or $400 camera.""
"20120308","5.0","Another great camera","I have owned a Panasonic camera since 2004 and loved the quality of pics and the ease of use. I have gifted one to my sister also. I had to retire my first panasonic after 6 years of use because while taking it out of the bag, I accidentally banged it on the wall lightly but the lens got stuck so I decided to buy a new camera because cameras nowadays are lighter and smaller even with the super zoom and my old panasonic has 12x zoom and was a bit big. After doing a lot of research on other brands, I knew I would end up buying lumix since I had tried nikon,olympus,fujifilm and a canon in the same price range and none had compared to the lumix. I am a loyal fan of panasonic and all the positive reviews and my own trials of different cameras led me to buy this camera. I got it on one day sale last month that amazon was having this camera for $99 the next day it went back to $130 even though it was still on sale original price being $179. I love everything abt this camera. Only thing that I don't like with this camera is that when the flash is not on indoors some pix are blurry. So I hope they improve that, I took a lot of pix with this camera when we went to Disney world and some shows in DW didn't allow use of flash so those pix ended up blurry but most place you can use your flash indoors and nighttime so it's not a major problem. Daytime pix are awesome and crisp and I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for cheap and best and a super zoom camera. Delivery was so quick, amazon said it'll take 5-7 days and it arrived within 3 days of ordering so that was awesome too! Very pleased with Amazon and the camera!""

"20120301","3.0","Disappointed at picture quality.  There are better ones out there.","I got this camera because the reviews were pretty good here in Amazon, and the price looks right.  I was hoping that I can get a compact camera which takes good picture quality that would replace my canon sx100 IS and I was sorely disappointed.Despite having a large 16mp camera sensor, the picture is much worse than my old canon sx100 is as well as other cheaper cameras that I have like my canon a590is.  Forget about the file size of the jpgs, all of my files are more than 6mb's while my canon sx100 is are about 2mb's.  Forget about low light, an iphone 4s camera can take better pictures at low light.I am looking for cameras with backside-illuminated cmos censors and ones which can take hd videos using h.264 compression (not mjpeg.)  These features should be standard in mid-tier cameras and trickling down to low end ones.  I would get a canon elph 100 instead or the elph 300 if you can afford a little more.  After an hour of use, I just returned it.""
"20120301","1.0","Panasonic Lumix camera","I bought this same camera a couple years ago and had it until I left if on an airoplane.  Purchased newer model and it only lasted a few months.  A small portion of the screen turned black about the third time I used the camera and that spot just kept getting bigger over the course of a few months.  I'm now looking online for a new camera and I won't be buying another Panasonic.""
"20120229","3.0","Panasonic DMC-FH25","I bought this camera mainly so I would have something small to take to events such as concerts. In addition to taking pictures I also wanted the video capabilities that many of these small cameras have. The camera was great in many respects but I was disappointed to learn that the zoom function will not operate while taking video. If you zoom it in while it is in camera mode it will stay zoomed when you switch to video mode, but all zoom functionality is disabled. For that reason I did something I have not yet done on Amazon, I returned it. I must say 'kudos' to Amazon. I figured I would have to pay return shipping, but no, they make it very easy to print the return shipping via UPS at no cost. Thanks Amazon! I finally settled on a Canon ELPH 300HS which has 5X optical zoom and 4x digital zoom which does function while taking videos. It also has full HD, stereo sound and a super slow motion feature. I got it for the same price as this camera and am very pleased with it.""
"20120227","5.0","Great Automatic Camera","This is a great camera. If it is on sale, take advantage. I only had one issue with this camera. It was not a design flaw. The camera had some contamination that made itself into the lens from assembly. This is not a common problem. The camera still took incredible pictures. I returned this camera and ordered another. Those saying this camera does not take good pictures probably can not use it. I had initially  taken over 2000 pictures with it within a one week period. Constantly turning it off and on. The color and clarity of the photos was incredible . I bought a Nikon S9100 a few weeks earlier than this one and had to return it cause the quality of the pictures were not up to par. Even though the Nikon was an incredible piece of tech the photos just looked flat and not crisp. With a few shots of this LUMIX I was convinced it took incredible pictures. I am a person who is not a professional at photo taking but often am complimented on how my photos look like Post cards. I usually use an upper end Kodak that creates incredible crisp and vibrant pictures. Due to the incredible lens and tech it contains. This Lumix was able to give me the same feel and was allot smaller for when I am not able to lug around a big camera. Remember this is a point and shot camera. It is not a manual camera. It will take pictures people spend thousands on filters and camera gear to accomplish automatically!!  It is small and very powerful.  Unless you need Super Macro or Super Zoom, this camera will work fine. My macro pictures turned out nice. It caught a Bee hovering above flower and caught the wings that were visible without blur!!  It is fast!!  The ISO is also great. If you are thinking about a camera, a Lumix is a great camera. Buy an extra battery. The battery is long lasting but since this camera is so easy to use you might just want to have an extra. I used one while on vacation and was glad I had it. Read the Manual. Info in it will make using it allot easier even though it is simple to use anyway. The camera is a solid 5.""
"20120223","5.0","Great camera","Seems to be as advertised, great pictures, easy to use. I like the zoom capabilities and the price for 16MP is a good deal. I think someone couldrewrite the user manual to be much more helpful.""
"20120222","5.0","great camera !","I've been needing a camera because the one that I had really sucked. I had a samsung one. When I was looking for digital cameras, I came across this one. It had a really low price and had many great reviews, so i bought it. Any camera would be better than the one I had. The camera shipped really fast. I got it in 2 days! Tried it out and the images are pretty clear. You just need to buy your own SD card, but it's a great camera offered for a cheap price.""

"20120221","5.0","Great camera","The item arrived earlier than expected. This camera is much better than I thought it would be. The zoom is fantastic and images are very crisp.""
