But this one is terrible.  I am an Insurance Adjuster and I take a majority of my pictures outside.  This thing will darken a picture on a sunshine day to the point where you cant see anything but black, and then Ill take a picture of something in daylight and it makes it a big bright white spot.  There is no happy medium.  I just need to be able to point and shoot and get a decent result and this camera does not achieve that.  I tried changing all sorts of setting and it keeps doing it.  I called Sony and they couldn't give me any answers or suggestions.  If I wouldn't have been stuck out of town and busy just after I received this piece of crap, I would have shipped it back.  It is a horrible camera in my opinion.""

I have taken and sold photos using this camera and can get very nice poster size prints.If you are the 'family photographer' you will get very nice shots with all the special features on this camera.

"20120411","2.0","A Terrible Replacement for my old cyber shot","I bought this product hoping to replace an old 8MP Cybershot I bought 4 or 5 years ago.I returned this camera after only 3 days.Compared with the old cybershot there was very little difference in the picture quality.Additionally, the camera takes much longer to take a picture and is far noiser when focusing.Not only that, they have striped the camera of the almost all the user adjustable settings. The camera now has an auto-adjust setting which is great if you are looking for a camera that needs little to no manual adjustments, otherwise, not so much. I immediately regretting not having the ability to alter between micro mode and distant landscape shots and the auto-adjust just caused more frustration.The only feature this camera has going for it is panorama mode, in my opinion.""
"20120405","3.0","Awesome for some things, not quite nice for others","The first day I was amazed by the image quality, those 16 megapixels works very good on taking extremely sharped photos.The panoramic option is awesome because it is very easy to use! Forget about the time you had to take several pictures and then match them on some software or more recently when we had to be very careful about the end of one frame and the begining of the next one. With this option you only have to move the camera from one side to another without even caring about the shaking of your hand! Haha!Another good thing is that the video quality is great and it doesnt seem like it has a limit of time per video recording. I used this camera to film an entire photoshoot and it worked awesome. The only thing I didnt like is that you have to be very careful when you are recording a video and moving at the same time (even just walking) because the image shakes too much and Im very good at that so I was kind of surprised when I saw the video on my computer.Now, the next thing may be a very good thing for most of you but for me not at all. This camera is soooo easy to use that it only has 3 options: pictures, panoramic and video. You only can take pictures in automatic mode, they left nothing to the creativity of photographers. Some digital cameras gives you the option of taking pictures in macro, night portraits, fireworks and some others but with this camera you cant do anything more than take automatic pictures. So pretty much the camera decides everything for you. It may be awesome for people who dont know anything about photography but for amateurs and professionals (even just curious users) it is a very limited use.Also, I think the zoom may be highly improved in nexts cybershots because it is almost as if you didnt have a zoom!Last thing. I guess the flash is just too weak, because I was in a concert and I just couldnt take any picture of the show because it was completely dark and since it doesnt have any other option than automatic... You can imagine I just lost my time trying to take a picture there.If you are going to use this camera in good lighting conditions and you are only interested in taking nice pictures without trying to do something special or different, then it is perfect for you. Photos of family and friends who are close to the camera will look awesome.""

After 6 months while I was hiking with this camera it failed, when I sent it in for repair the claim was denied for excessive moisture.No liquid was ever spilled on this camera but the unit was exposed to some sweat while hiking (it was in my shirt pocket in a case). I have never had another camera fail in this manner and I used to be a professional photographer and have traveled extensively with both pro and point and shoot models. If a camera can't hold up to normal vacation activities it is no use to me.Lesson learned? If you keep this around the house then it should be OK, if you lead an active lifestyle forget about it!""

The image quality when taking a standard photo is very good. The zoom capability, far exceeded my expectations. I've gotten some really nice clear images, when using the zoom. One dissapointment for me, would have to be the quality of the panorama image quality. Some Panoramic images look great on the camera screen but when transfered to a pc, the image resolution is lacking. Then there are those panoramic images that come out beautifully (I've posted a few). The video quality is pretty good, a lot better than my old panasonic camera. I like that you are able to zoom while shooting a video. I can't rate the battery life just yet. From what I've gathered, some say that its good while others say it's not. Just to be sure, I will be purchasing another battery.  IF you want a small and easy to use camera, with some neat features this is the camera for you.

It is not quite as bad as most smart phones, but I've had to train myself to charge this battery after every event after having it die early on several occasions. I also had issues importing pictures. I use a pretty standard SD card. The first batch of pictures I imported were mysteriously lost. (This is also using a brand new laptop with windows 7). I was forced to use an off-the-shelf data restoring program to save the pictures. now I don't trust the camera to import, I just take out the SD card and plug it into the computer. I suppose this could be an isolated incident, but I'd rather be safe. Overall, good price, but I liked the Canon Power shot much better.""

This is the first time I've used a camera that had a panoramic feature that uses multiple shots to generate one wide or tall image. It worked very well! The camera has other fun features like a timer that only takes a picture once one or two people are in the frame. If you're used to other cameras of the same year, you may experience a slower shutter speed than you're used to, but believe me, that is a slight if even noticeable drawback.

We searched for online issues and chatted with a repair specialist with Sony. After doing what we were instructed, two white lines appeared. So, we were then instructed to send the camera off to the manufacturer for repair. Disappointing... we hope that it will be repaired successfully.""
"20110725","4.0","Slight victory of form over function","With such a broad variety of nice point-and-shoot cameras in this price range one gets to be picky, and a couple of relatively minor things is all that's wrong with this camera. I am a pretty big Sony fan and own, or have owned, many items from them - headphones, laptops, cameras, and of course, PSP and PS3. This one is a bit of a let-down. Not a BAD camera, just clearly not the best, and clearly not up to the standard of Sony quality and construction. Here's why:- The marketing photos look cooler than the camera does in person. The rear of the case is dark gray plastic; only the front half is silver.- The shutter release button is a small, low-profile rectangle. Every other camera ever made has a circular shutter release that protrudes from the top, making it very easy to locate without looking for it. This one is smooth and low-profile so it's not as easy to just blindly grab and shoot. I just can't fathom why they would have made a button that's harder to locate by touch...- Untrue to Sony's standard, the body feels light-weight and plasticy. The buttons (power, shutter release, zoom) feel kind of loosely fitted not solid and firm. Very un-Sony-like.- The flash is overpowering for subjects up close. Subjects across the room (or the room itself) turn out pretty good colors with flash on.- The battery life is truly abysmal. I took around 50 test pictures and one short (&lt;15s) video and found that a fully-charged, brand-new battery was completely flat dead. I'm hoping this was some fluke with the first charge of the battery or something, although I haven't observed that in other cameras.But does it take good pictures?Yes!Focus works well even while zoomed all the way in. Image stabilization works brilliantly. Low-light images turn out pretty well - obviously you need a steady hand and it won't take a sharp picture of a crazy kid chasing the dog across the room with only table lamps on, but if the kid stops for a second, you can get a good pic. Colors are very life-like. In pictures taken outside, I got about 19/20 clear and sharp and the one that wasn't sharp was only because it snapped a second photo while I was taking the camera down to put in my pocket - so, essentially 100% sharp clear focus as long as you're pointing at the thing you want a picture of. Indoors I'd say about 2/3 of the pictures came out perfectly clear in very low, incandescent light with no flash.It's so-so because of the aforementioned form factor issues and dreadful battery life. Taking good pictures is meaningless if the thing goes through 2 or 3 batteries in a single afternoon outing. I'll revise my rating up to 4/5 if in subsequent use I find that the thing has more acceptable battery life; but, fewer than 100 pictures is just crazy. On other point-and-shoot cameras, even some where there are complaints about battery life, I've been able to take 200+ pictures, half indoors w/ flash and half outdoor with zoom heavily used, and 5-10 minutes of video, and the battery still indicates full charge. This issue alone could be a deal-breaker for this otherwise OK camera.==============Revising the review up from 3 to 4 stars. Although the first use did have a fully-charged battery, the same battery, as well as the backups I bought, do appear to deliver a more standard, expected usage in the camera - several hundreds of photos over a couple of weeks. Glad that that was just a new-battery fluke!""
"20110725","5.0","Good value for the money","I have to disagree with some of these reviews regarding the build quality of this Sony. I have owned HP, an Olympus, two previous Sony's, two Nikon's, and two Canon's. They were all 100% plastic bodies like the DSCW570. I carried them in pants pockets or a shoulder bag. Some were dropped more than a few times onto garage or concrete floors. None including this Sony ever suffered any damage because of the plastic case.If they broke, it was inside. The Nikon was dropped and the lens failed to extend. An earlier Sony became intermittent. They were sold or given away on Craigslist or BCKS. I carry this Sony in my pants pocket along with a cell phone. It has never been a problem.I went away from Sony before because I was tired of paying a lot for their proprietary media sticks but there were features of those Sony's I always liked. For example, the infrared focusing beam allows composing in total darkness something my HP, Olympus, and Nikon's could not do. I liked a feature which showed up in my second Canon. It automatically would switch to Macro mode when necessary and would automatically select a Scene mode in Auto mode. In Program mode, it allowed adjusting the exposure, metering method (spot, central area, multi-area), etc. The Sony does the same.All the other cameras were 3 to 1 optical zooms or less with similar f stop range to the 570 so I see nothing unusual about that. Some would automatically switch to digital zoom so it was necessary to watch out for that happening. The 570 does not do that. One of the earlier cameras had a battery compartment door switch which caused it to open when sliding it into your pants. I would reach for the camera and end up with a handful of batteries. The 570 does not do that either.Some cameras have the flash near the upper left side of the camera unlike the 570 which has it in the middle. I used to accidentally put a finger over part of the flash when holding the camera with two hands. That does not happen with the 570.What could be improved is that the electrical connector on the bottom of the camera is completely exposed unlike some cameras which have a rubber cover over it. I also miss the optical viewfinder that the Canon's had but they were larger cameras. A very nice feature is that the manual is actually stored in the camera. That feature was not in any of my older cameras. The written manual is pretty worthless since the camera's internal manual contains more information. The information does not entirely overlap. For example, the information about how many photos per battery charge is in the printed manual but not in the camera but the camera contains the information about all the onscreen icons.I also like the feature that you can review the photos in the camera without using the on/off switch which extends the lens. Just hit the review button and the screen comes on without the lens opening. By the time I count 'one', 'two' the image is up. Another feature not available in my older cameras is the ability to review photos by date. The 570 can display a calendar, you select the date, it shows the photos from that date.Some of my previous cameras had a battery low warning indicator but by the time it gave a warning, the batteries were about gone. The 570 indicator gives a more precise indication in bars like a cell phone signal strength indicator.Panoramic mode has been available on other cameras for awhile. It is not a feature I found worth while in any camera. I think this is a perfectly satisfactory product which has been trouble free and a pleasure to use.""
"20110721","4.0","Fun and easy to use","I bought this because my mom had wanted her own digital camera to take pictures with. She knows absolutely nothing about technology, so the Intelligent Auto mode works wonderfully for her! It continually tries to choose the best scene mode for all pictures, and it actually works really well! The camera takes beautiful outdoor pictures during the daytime, and photos look great under normal lighting conditions when taking photos indoors. Flash photos at night look a little too bright and soft. The zoom works well, but the noise it makes is loud and somewhat 'clunky'.The screen is big and bright at 2.7 inches, and the camera itself is small; it's a bit longer than my palm and it's super slim. Even my mom, a petite Asian woman, thought it was a little too small! I like that Sony made a slider button for the different playback modes so that you can capture photos/videos during the action. You can change it from picture to panorama to video instantly -- no fiddling around with menus here! The menus themselves are easily navigable, and you are given 3 different color options to change the menu color. The color of the camera is pretty close to the picture, and it's a gorgeous shade of metallic violet! It will definitely stand out from the usual black and silver cameras most people own.This camera will be great for people who just want a nice point and shoot camera under $200. The in-camera guide is also quite helpful for those who have never used a digital camera before.""

"20110704","2.0","Poor and misleading instructions for other than the most basic 'point and shoot'","Unlike the last reviewer I found this camera near impossible to use other than for the most basic of point and shoot functions. I have spent over eight hours today going over both sets of printed data and the in-camera guide menus with the actual camera menus.  There are numerous instances of missing, misleading  and incorrect information. Instruction manual & user guide both are frequent misleading and in places factually inaccurate; neither are identical with each other and neither are identical to the internal 'In Camera Guide' -- which in turn does not match the detailed settings and their hierarchy within the actual'Menu.'Basic simple user data is missing -- for example how to physically remove the battery without probing inside the device or applying an inappropriate degree of force; the first attempt took 15 minutes, once you know how of course it's a matter of 10 seconds! The battery needs re-charging after about 2 hours if you are simply going through the menu's and loaded guides trying to discover and set and use the various functions. I would suggest buying a second battery for anything but the most occasional 'point and shoot' use.The viewer is large -- however despite appearances and claims it is not wysiwyg; the center of the image is fine but you can never be exactly certain precisely where the actual image file edge will be, therefore for other than the most casual of snapshots all images will have to be tidied in an image editor to ensure decent basic composition.  Also, the viewer only gives an approximation and does not in my opinion show accurately the combined impact of any ISO and lens settings for depth of field etc.As a piece of equipment seems good value for money, providing you neglect the many hours of time you will have to spend, because of the poor instruction sets, playing with the camera working out exactly how all but the most basic functions interrelate.""

"20110507","2.0","Sometimes newer isn't better","I gave away my Sony DSC-W350 to a relative because she loved my camera (I had it for less than a month) and always wanted to replace it with the identical or similar model. I saw the DSC-W570 and thought it would be a slight upgrade in zoom and everything else would remain the same since the specs are practically identical. I ended up getting a great deal on it ($149.99) which was less than what I bought the W350 for. After less than a week with it, I'm not impressed. I can see why the W350 is still holding its value compared to this new model (priced less than $10 within each other brand new). It only has a slightly better zoom but the actual material of the camera is not as good as the W350. In fact, the front has a metal body but the back (the LCD side) is a lousy shimmery plastic. Also, the LCD is not remotely as crisp as the W350. Even though the W350 and W570 are supposed to be close relatives (in every aspect), I find the W350 a superior camera. Within a week of the purchase, I'm sending it right back for a refund and will be picking up another W350. Yes I'll sacrifice a bit in zoom, but the W350 is better in every other way. This product was a let down - Sony shouldn't have bothered releasing it.""
"20110427","4.0","Sony Cybersot DSC-W570 16.1 MP Digital Camera","This is a great product and Target delivered it on-time as promised but I was very surprised that it did not come with an SD memory card because I took it to my award ceremony & was shocked that after 6-7 pictures the internal memory was full & I had to get my friends to take pictures & email them to me so that I would not missed out on my big day.  For the price, I was just expecting a bit more but apart from that it was a good buy & I would recommend it.""
"20110418","2.0","Not a good value for the price (cheap cheap cheap build quality)","I picked up a DSC-W570 recently at 'a major discount warehouse chain' (actually, Amazon is cheaper on the price, though). I paid $179.00 for the bundle.The camera was blister packed with the camera, case, memory card, and basic accessories that included a USB cable, software, wrist strap, and battery/charger. When you look at this camera even up close, it almost appears to have a metal body, which would have been great.  Unfortunately, once you unpack it, you realize it's plastic - and not just any standard grade of plastic, but EXTREMELY cheap, 'toy-grade' plastic.  It stands to reason that these days most of the sub-$200 cameras are going to be made of plastic, but this really did feel like a toy, even once the small battery was installed to add a little weight to it.  I handed it to several coworkers who commented, 'Oh, is this for children?', and were shocked when I told them it was $179.00.That aside, with battery charged, I tested the camera out and I'll just go over a few of the very basics here.  The camera is small enough to fit into a pocket, though due to the build quality I'd be tempted not to do it as it could easily break.  The 5X zoom lens extends from the body quickly and does features an optical image stabilization (I.S.) system which I would rate as 'so-so effective', due to the fact the lens has a maximum aperture of around 6.2/6.3 when you're fully zoomed; this means it takes in much less light when zoomed, and unless you have excellent light, the camera has to use a slower shutter speed to get the shot.  Even outdoors on a sunny day but in shade, and even with I.S., the camera produced several blurry shots due to this. The LCD screen is of a lower resolution but still usable for composing shots, though it's a bit hard to see in sunlight - there is no optical viewfinder due to the small size of the camera.One of the selling features of this camera is the 'sweep panorama' mode, where you aim at a scene to the left, press the shutter, and move the camera to the right; the camera will then 'stitch' several images together to make a long panoramic shot. The pano shots are lower in resolution however, and while good for using online or for very small prints, can't be enlarged well.  Also, the camera does not adjust for lighting variations, so during the left-to-right 'sweep', if part of your subject is in brighter light than the rest, it will most likely be completely washed out in the finished photo.  The pano only works left-to-right, and you cannot use it vertically (up and down) for that type of pano, as the camera will give you an error message.  You can make adjustments in the menu system to things like image size (in megapixels), exposure compensation, focusing, and even spot metering, but other more basic things are not available such as image quality (normal/fine/super fine) found on almost all other camera models.  The 720p video feature actually takes halfway decent video indoors in well lit areas, but outdoors in bright sun, colors appear washed out/faded, and the level of detail is fairly blurry (though you can use the zoom during movie recording).  Battery life was average, as it's a tiny battery, so you'll need a spare for all day shooting.  Overall image quality was 'so so', and the 16 megapixel size of the pics mean next to nothing really on this size of camera as it's a very tiny chip inside that does the capture.  When viewed close, the images typically have more of a watercolorish look to them, and if you crank up the iso (light sensitivity) past the lowest numbers, this effect gets much worse, very quickly.Honestly, if this camera were in the $99-$109 range, I would complain much less about it's shortcomings, and especially the incredibly cheesy build quality.  But with retail prices in the $149-$179 range for this unit, I'd say there are better offerings for that price from Canon, Olympus, or even Casio in terms of build quality.  Fuji has a very similar model to this Sony that sells retail for around $119.00.  I'm not a photography newbie, and I know what you should reasonably expect from a camera compared to it's price point - and this model is just far too 'cheap' in quality to warrant spending the money for it unless there's a significant price drop.""
"20120401","5.0","Easy to use and a nice design.","Although I love taking pictures, I've always been weary of buying one.  I generally manage with my cell phone (8mp on my current one) or I rent a more professional one from my university.  I was pleased with this one not only because it was quite cheap where I got it (about 100 with tax from RC Wiley), but also the simple user-ability as my parents will likely want to use it and it takes nearly no explanation to use.I have no qualms with more advanced cameras, but I really only wanted this to supplement my phone camera and to just have will me in my bag when I go out.  Although the camera on my phone is nice, it really is awful at night and you can only do adjustments once the picture has been taken.  This has more than made up for it and at this point I have no complaints.I opted for the black as they had black and silver on display (and they had pink in stock).  The black just looked nicer to me and I would be able to tell it apart from my old Nikon at a glance (it is silver, though also big and bulky so it probably would not have mattered).  The size is a good size in that I can fit it in most of my pockets - something that will be good come summer when I go on vacation.  The screen is very nice and crisp.  So far all the features like panoramic have been simple to use and have good results.Generally I go for Canons just as a preference, but looking at the specs for all the basic Canon and even Nikon cameras on display, for the price this was the best and so far I've been beyond pleased with it (even more so because I was spending store credit).I don't know if I would have bought it for 165 like the current price on Amazon, but for the 100 I paid it is a great buy for something you want to take nice pictures with.  In the larger price range I think that there might be better cameras for that price, but for what I wanted it for this was a very good buy.""

I love the pixels on this camera, I love that my pictures are never washed out, I love the macro setting. But... after 8 months, my flash stopped working. It doesn't matter what setting I'm on, even with the flash set on permanently, nothing. Even restoring the camera to the default factory settings didn't make my flash work again.

"20120313","3.0","Good pics in a mini package - might be 3.7 stars","I got my camera for a trip to Tahiti.I bought it for light weight at portability. It did all that I expected. Pictures were good quality for my standard of picture taking. Speed in low light is a bit slow, and recycle time between pictures is also a bit slow. Saw some prior complaints on the battery life, but if you want a small camera, then this is a trade off. I did not feel that the battery life was too short. My biggest complaint is the size of the shutter button. It is way too small and difficult to see and use. Unfortunately, I lost this camera. I Will replace it with the slightly bigger and more expensive  WX9 which weighs .8 oz more, but I believe has a bigger shutter button.""
"20120313","4.0","Great little camera!","I received this camera for Christmas, and so far I'm really happy with it.  My previous digital camera, an Olympus, wasn't bad, but it had a few faults that this one doesn't.  This camera is thin and very portable, more so than my Olympus.  It comes with it's own rechargable battery, which is better than my old Olympus which used AA's like they were going out of style.  I've recharged the battery once since I got it, and though I have used it, I didn't think I'd used it enough to require a battery recharge, so I will be getting a spare battery before I travel with it.  It's got a good zoom.  The picture quality is excellent.  I can even go in and change the size that I want the picture to be, which helps me be able to store more pictures on a memory card.  It's pretty easy to use, which is always a plus.  All in all, despite the battery (which I don't consider a downfall after all the AA's I went through with my last camera), I would totally recommend this camera.  Though, I hate to say this on here, I would recommend getting it somewhere else, cause the prices on here are higher than most stores sell it for.""

I had to get a camera to make due until the insurance claims came through, etc. I really like the size of this, because I always have it on hand (in my purse). It also has a Carl Zeiss lense like my previous camcorder, and I LOVE the color. It works well enough that I have not replaced my camcorder yet, although there is no comparison between the two. This one does have its advantages though (size).""

Seeing as it's over 8yrs old and the picture quality has plummeted, I went back out into the market for another casual camera. I was looking for something that could handle my shaky hands and need for quick successive pictures.I love this camera. It auto-adjusts to the surrounding, pictures look crisp and clean and it remembers your settings. If you turn off the flash and then turn the camera off and then back on, the flash doesn't come back on, which is very nice! It will take pictures quickly and it a perfect pocket size.I used my old SD card in the camera, it will convert old pictures to the same file type. It will also 'series; pictures. For instance, if you take 9 pictures in a few hours, when reviewing them it was label them as 1-9, the next time you take a picture the numbering process will begin again. I find it a handy way to separate when showing off the pictures, especially if they're similar.2 complaints:1, its rechargeable battery does die quickly. The camera comes with a 15% off coupon that I'd recommend using to buy a spare battery or a quick charge device.2, the viewing screen is a glossy flat screen and fingerprints show up easily on it.

The Macro is awesome, and it automatically switches to that when you are close enough to whatever you are shooting.  It has a setting that automatically takes pictures when it detects smiles, which kinda weirds me out, but you can totally turn that off.  And it has a pink display setting which makes me happy because my other camera was pink and I was a little sad that I couldn't get one that same color.  I have the black one, and it is shimmery/glittery which I also love so it's all good.  Another feature that is really cool is the panorama setting.  You just hit the shutter button, and move the camera to the right and it takes multiple frames and makes one long picture.  So cool!  It is really small, and I am afraid sometimes that I will drop it, so I make sure to put the wrist band on every time I use it.

ANd if you know what you're doing, you can fiddle with all kinds of controls in the other modes. There are also a ton of different scenes (which as far as I can tell are subtle focus and lighting effects) to take pictures of food, pets, people, fireworks, landscape, underwater, and many more. There are also different settings for smile detection, red eye guard, different facial focusing, etc. The panoramic mode is very fun and easy to use, allowing you to take wide, long shots. Unlike other cameras I've seen with this mode, you simply hold down the button and move the camera, as opposed to taking multiple shots and blending the pictures together. It also has a video recorder, which has all the same scenes as picture taking mode.Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this camera, either if you're a newbie or a pro.""

"20111221","3.0","It's Okay","I bought this camera on Black Friday at a big box store.  It was only $89.  I am glad I didn't invest more than that into it.  As some people have written about the poor construction of this camera, I would agree to one of the complaints...the shutter button is too small and odd shaped, which makes it hard to find by touch.  I own a nice Nikon SLR camera, so I suppose my expectations were high with regards to image quality, however I also own a Sony Cybershot P93 which I have also used for about 6 or 7 years, so I kinda knew what to expect.  The images are large, but grainy.  The flash is over-powering in some instances.  Panorama works for big open areas, but if you are using it inside anywhere and someone moves, they may look like an alien when the camera composes the panoramic image.  I am not a big fan of the 'smile' gizmo, I would prefer to have the 'macro' option that was available on the Sony P93.I bought this camera because it is small and is easy to toss in a pocket or bag, as opposed to lugging a large camera body with multiple lenses.  I do like that it is small, but if you have large hands, you might have problems.  It powers up quick and you can snap pictures quickly after turning it on.  It's not a bad camera and there are some neat accessories for this camera, but I wouldn't pay more than $100 for it.""
"20111220","4.0","small and easy camera","THe camera is very small, the smallest I have ever had and that's good because I wanted as a second camera for those moments when you cant carry the big one. The camera is very easy to use but it doesnt have a black and white mode!!! and that's a big minus for me...""
"20111218","2.0","Disappointing","There are other reviews that go into detail.  Bottom line is- this camera is cheap ( construction) , very slow and the pic quality is unremarkable.  I am returning it.  I bought a Samsung with a touch screen - much, much better.""

"20111216","4.0","Great for newbies","I bought this from Costco for $160 and I would recommend this even at that price. Amazon is selling for lower than that.I am a total newbie at photography and while I own a DSLR, I hate taking photographs. I rarely ever remember to take a camera along even for important occasions.Here is what I liked about the DSC-W570 (Pros from my perspective)* Very light (some have complained that this is attributable to cheap plastic construction) - but I love the nearly non-existent weight of this camera* Very thin (some have complained that this makes it look toy-like) - but this means this can fit in your pocket with only a little bulge. That means I actually remember to carry it with me often* Easy and quick to take photographs - goes from OFF to photo-ready in nearly 1-2 seconds* Takes good photos with little effort - the easy mode is sufficient for me. There are more selectable modes but I have never needed themHere is what some may not like:* If you are worried that this camera is too delicate, buy a padded bag for it. The Costco package came with one and thats all I have needed to carry it in my pocket* There are numerous 'easy' modes - not sure why a camera needs so many - but if you don't like the 'easy' mode then there is another 'iAuto' or you could just use the 'selectable' modes (the list keeps going)* If you want more control on your shot, buy a different camera - I can't tell if this camera provides anySome have mentioned a few competing cameras that are cheaper and I tried 3 similar cameras in this price range before settling on the DSC-W570. It is not the best but it meets all my expectations for a point-and-click.""
"20111215","4.0","cybershot camera","i need to take pictures of people within 15 feet of the camera. the sony DCS-W570 easily fits into a shirt pocket. it's important to hold a camera still while taking a picture and the W570's optical image stabilizer 'optical steadyshot' helps.  auto-focus works well-- with a half press of the shutter button, the focus is locked so the image can be recomposed while keeping the original target as the focus distance. the auto-focus 'assist lamp' sends out a red beam in dark environment.the auto-exposure light measure works well.  if you want to overrule the camera, set the EV to a plus setting (e.g +1) for a brighter picture, or set EV to negative (e.g. -2) for a darker picture.the sensitivity of the imaging sensor 'CCD' can be adjusted by setting the 'ISO'-- a higher value (e.g 200) increases the sensitivity and a faster shutter speed is utilized.  increasing ISO is helpful in a dimly lit environment without flash or for fast moving subject.auto-DRO mode 'Dynamic Range Optimizer,' adjusts for the difference between light and dark parts of an image and corrects the brightness and contrast.  auto-DRO can be set to off, auto-standard, or auto-plusburst mode sets the camera to take three pictures with one press of shutter.the flash can be set to OFF, always ON, or auto.'intelligent scene advanced' with flash set to auto will have two consecutive picures taken. the first one may use the flash, the second without flash but camera settings automatically determined (based on how the imaging sensor analyzes the first).when connected to a computer, image files and video files can be dragged from the camera to computer. files on the SDHC card 'flash memory' can be deleted from the camera by using computer or by using delete function in the camera itself.  there is 70MB internal memory which is used without a flash card installed.panorama mode is used by pressing and releasing the shutter, then moving the camera in one direction while the camera takes two additional pictures and combines them into one.  you can crop the resulting image on a computer so you keep just the wanted part of the extra-wide picture.  panorama can also be set to create vertical image.the video works well.  high def is 1280x720.  smaller files can be created using VGA (640x480) or a smaller size.  the zoom function works while taking video.  the built-in microphone (not stereo) works well.if still pictures are taken in high resolution, the file size is large. on your computer you can crop the wanted part of the image and create a smaller size file which has high resolution.VGA still images and VGA videos are excellent for posting online.still images and videos can be viewed in the camera on the 2.7 inch display which has 230,000 dots. however, the display is difficult to see in bright sunlight which makes aiming the camera difficult.the image quality of the W570 has been ok, however one doing his homework should look at the differences between an image taken with a 'point & shoot' (small size sensor) and an image taken with a larger size sensor. (sony NEX cameras have a sensor which is about the area of four thumbnails called 'APS-C' sensor while 'point & shoot' have one pinky fingernail). seeing the images and zooming in on both images will give a taste of how much better or worse the large sensor camera is vs. 'point & shoot' camera.  also know that some sony WX-series 'point & shoot' cameras which have a 'CMOS' type sensor also have a feature that combines several images into one picture taking advantage of the best qualities of the several. the W570 does not have this feature. 'The WX9 camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology.'  W570 is a good camera with a tiny imaging sensor.""

Couple of clicks and it's in the mail.Problem was that its' software once loaded took over my desktop, but it would not allow me to move photos from camera to PC. After messing with it several days, I broke it in the drive way and threw the scraps in the garbage. My way of dealing with crap.""

"20111212","4.0","GReaTTT BUY!!","The camera shipping came super fast!!I havn't had the camera for that long yet but I can tell you some few thingsPros:- 16.1 Megapix, extremely good quality- Very light weight and stylish camera and slim too- 3 different type of ways to capture image: Regular Snap shots, Paramount picture, and Video capture- Camera settingsCons:- The camera is not that good looking, because I was only able to see the front of the camera,which looked nice, until I receive the camera and saw the backside. It wasn't as I suspected. It wasn'trectangular all around, which i would have liked it more. However, I bought this camera for my gf, which she really liked. So it can go either way.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the camera.""

"20111201","4.0","Great deal for the price","I bought this camera as an early Christmas gift for my girlfriend so that she could use it at a hockey game we were going to.  It met her criteria perfectly since she wanted a small, lightweight camera with lots of mega-pixels.  The camera works great so far and she is very pleased.I took off a star because of the slow shutter speed that sometimes gives off blurry pictures, but that's my complaint and not hers!  I would recommend this for anyone looking for a compact camera to take around and snap pictures.""
"20111130","4.0","Easy to use and compact enough","Smart mode allows the camera has good shots and acceptable quality for photos, in addition to this varierdad has more advanced features that are of little use from my point of view but are of great use to certain times. It seems a great price for the number of features with the camera. against The HD videos are not a very good image quality ...Your sharing settings""
"20111129","5.0","Good point & shoot camera, light-weight, good pictures","Overall I'm pretty happy with this camera in violet. It's lightweight, portable and takes great photos.One thing that I don't like is that you can only set the flash to off or auto, there is no manual switch to turn it simply on or off, so sometimes it doesn't go off when you need it.The picture quality is good, I do agree with other people that the battery life isn't too long, however at least the battery is rechargeable and you don't need to keep buying new batteries. It would be nice if you could charge the camera with the AV/USB cable that it comes with.The sweep panorama mode is great, I took a few cool shots with it. Definitely don't expect because the MP is higher that you'll get DSLR quality, photos, but nevertheless for a point and shoot, this a good camera especially for the price.""
"20111124","5.0","Love it, Love it.","Very nice camera. It takes beautiful pictures. Love the panoramic picture. The movie is very clear and sharp. You can carry it in your pocket. Thin and small enough to take it to trips.""
"20111122","4.0","Easy to Use, limited memory","For the most part, we love this camera.  Our one fault to find would be that it has very limited internal memory for our use, (we use this camera in an office, to capture pics of plant equipment etc., and use a fairly high resolution).  I've since purchased an external memory card which takes care of this problem; however, the external memory card had to be special ordered, as the camera doesn't take just an ordinary SD card.  On a high note though, the camera takes amazing pictures, and is super compact, so there isn't anything big or bulky to lug around.  Very pleased with this purchase.""

"20111103","5.0","Love the panoramic feature","The panoramic picture is a great feature. Really gives a whole new perspective for pictures and you can get a lot more in one picture.I admit though that I'm a bigger fan of the older cameras that had less MP and used less memory per image.Sometimes I have a bit of a hard time focusing, but it's because I'm new at using this camera and haven't figured it out yet. My old camera was much easier to use in this regard.But it's a great little camera this one and i'm happy i have it.""

Take great pics and has great features and for the cost it's a great camera.""
"20111020","5.0","Really great camera for the price","I bought this camera because I wanted to retire the old Nikon I bought back in 2005.  Let's just say technology has greatly improved within the past 6 years!  I was so impressed with the panoramic mode!  I've heard other cameras make you match the last frame, but this one takes panoramic pictures with one clean sweep.  Impressive since I'd be lucky to get a picture without a 15 second processing time on my old one.  I think it takes pretty good night pictures with the flash, it has a short processing time and it's easy to use.  One negative thing I would say is that you can't see if your battery is low unless you hit the delete button.  You don't have to actually delete a picture, but you have to get into that screen.  Maybe I just haven't corrected a setting yet, but I did find that sort of odd.""
"20111005","3.0","sony camera but smh","so got my camera a month ago, had time to play with it, drop it etc. it got scratch now lol but works superbstaken all kinds of photos , panoramic shots are easy to do .if you are looking for a small decent camera, you willlove this one. its smaller than the pictures makes it to look like so ideal for slipping away in your pocket. for the price i got it on here for about $129.99 compared to its price tags in stores at electronic express, satisfied with my purchase.sadly i spoke too soonin December, 3 months later went to a house party and a friend of mine dropped my camera on a kitchen floor and that was the end of the camera, and sending it bk to sony to fix would cost $120 for them to fix, further more picture quality during the day was good but was not excellent,evening was worse , the battery latch prior to the camera breaking , was faulty and constantly kept opening at times even if in my pocket or just before taking a picture if one applies pressure underneath resulting with the battery falling out. for the money i had hoped for a quality product, cybershot sucked on mine esp some moved , weirdly /funny enough i got a friend with the same camera different colour, and her camera takes quality pics better than mine and her cyber shot worked fine despite the few secs and double flash to wait for. but we both had the same prob with the battery latch, so mayb its batch thing or something. anyway i have decided to get Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX1 10MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 5x Optical ' for and extra $70 ,i knock on wood no ones messes this next camera for me.""
