"20120607","3.0","Less than expected.","The PlaySport Zx5 has okay video quality, no less than expected from a pocket camcorder. There's a lot of picture 'noise' when I zoom in, though.  The sound is really bad.  People directly behind the camcorder are heard better than anyone in front. I wish that Kodak made a little external microphone so I could get better sound from my subjects when it is the focus of the occasion (like my child's concert). The camera-shake compensation is okay, the subject-tracking is just a little slow.  I really want the Canon Vixia M40 or M400, but until their prices come back down ($349 just days before Thanksgiving, now they are over $550)this little toy will just have to do.""

"20120531","4.0","Easy and good.  But not great.","This camera is easy to use.  The software is also easy to use and uploading to youtube and facebook etc is a snap.  It records great looking video in 1080.  720 is pixelated on my computer and tv's.  The audio is not overly compressed IMO so background noise does not overpower everything.  It does not however handle really high SPL very well.  I tried recording a concert and it was nothing but noise and distortion.  I didnt buy this camera for that purpose though.  The auto focus work very well.  It doesnt do that annoyong jerky focus thing that some cameras do.In still picture mode the resolution is great - until you zoom.  Once you zoom the picture gets very pixelated.  So if your are looking for a good still picture camera this is not for you.The second day I owned this camera my son spilled a glass of koolaid on it.  I cleaned it off with a damp towel.  No issues.This camera does not have a built in usb conector to plug into your computer but a cable is provided(mini usb to usb).  I just keep it in my laptop bag.I like this camera.  It meets all my needs - capturing family videos and occasional still pictures.  Its tough enough for rugged outdoors trips so its something I wont easily break.  For the price, its easy to use, takes nice looking and sounding video, and its ok at still pictures too.  If price is not a issue for you, this is a good camera but not great one.  There are better but not for this price.""
"20120528","3.0","Solid Device Needs Constant Recharging","I've had the Zx5 for about 4 months now and have been fairly happy with it. My main complaints have been the fact that a fully charged battery only lasts for about 2 hours when recording a video. And somehow it drains battery power on its own and Kodak recommends that you ensure that it's fully charged before using it which means having to keep it on the charger at all times in case you should ever need to use it. This was my second one. I had the red version of this for exactly 1 day, and it kept freezing up on me and had to be repeatedly reset with a paperclip. Since swapping out for this black one, I've not had a similar problem.Over all, the camcorder is a decent device which can endure most normal use condition, including exposure to water, accidental dropping and dust which makes it perfect for most sports activities. This is one camcorder that I never need to worry where on the floor board it might land as a result of sudden vehicle stops and turns. Its size, form and durability makes it perfect for carrying in your front or back pocket to be taken just about anywhere. Its lack of buttons and overly complicated menus makes it perfect for quick and easy use. You can set it up to share with Facebook, an email address, Flickr, YouTube, and a few other networks and sites that I'm not familiar with. Personally, I prefer to use it with my Eye-Fi Connect X2 4GB Wireless SDHC Memory Card and send any picture or video taken directly to my laptop and Facebook account automatically.The camcorder is a solid device, but its constant demand for recharging is its primary drawback.""
"20120528","4.0","Kodak Playsport ZX5 Battery Life","I just received the Burton Bundle edition a week ago and have not had much time to play with it.  My first concern was battery life since it is not replaceable like it was on the ZX3. I charged the battery and used the 4GB class 4 SD card that came in the bundle.  I set the recording resolution to 720p, put the camcorder on the tripod and started recording. At 1:12 the card was full.  I erased the card and continued recording.  I did this a couple more times and determined that the battery would record for over 3 1/2 hours on the one charge.  During the recording I did not do any zooming or stopping and starting which probably will influence battery life somewhat.I concluded that I would use a 16GB card which will last longer than the battery.  I know in the past Kodak camcorders could only use class 4 cards but that has changed with firmware updates.""

We now share this camera (it's 'her phone') both to watch & to shoot movies.Upsides:* you can film things without worrying your battery is going to run down & you can't make/get calls* waterproof and shockproof means less concern about water damage or dropping* no tapes so when your child does something cute you are always cued up & ready to record* faster boot time than my phoneDownside:* if you can't remember where you set it down you can't just 'call you camera'* non-removable battery can limit your record times* no wireless sharing (maybe get an EyeFi card?)Bottom line: James Cameron isn't going to film his next movie on this (and neither are you) but for quick recordings for sharing with family, more than adequate.""

I have used this camera for about 4 hours total in water time (over several months). It takes decent enough shots but it is such a poorly built product that Kodak should withdraw it from the market (US build quality for those international buyers so beware). After 4 hours use over several months the doors to the usb and memory card jammed tight (they appeared to have effectively rusted solid) rendering the camera useless. The freezing that others have noted occurred but was manageable, but once the doors on the side have seized up, you cannot charge the camera or reset it when it does freeze. Inevitably I had to break the doors open, thereby ruining the camera and subsequently threw it out. I love Kodak film, but this camera is a dog that should be avoided at all costs.""

The shockproof feature is great as I can hand it off to my toddler without worrying too much. Haven't exercised the waterproof feature yet.My first experience returning stuff (Zx3) bought at Amazon and I was pleased to see how smooth the return and refund was.""

But it lasted so well.I order this Zx5 and the very first time in pretty tame conditions, it leaked in a BIG way. BOTH ports totally leaked and FULL of water, and this was in the first 10 minutes of being splashed and submerged  while protected in my pocket. No direct water impact to the case or anything. The doors went from stiff and hard to open, to super lightweight and the seals are 'fluffy soft' compared to the Zx3.Do NOT put this in the water and maybe you will like it.

"20120203","3.0","Pay attention to the detail of the picture","I got a replacement via Amazon. The reason for returning the first purchase is, when taking picture in dark circumstances or even when a part of the picture is dark, annoying dashed lines occurred, quite randomly.I've tried many times and when taking photos or videos under noon sun light, nothing happens, but as soon as I walked into a room, dashed lines crawled into the photos and videos, more or less, thick or thin, mostly transversing exactly vertically.But the camera its self is lovely and handy, will keep it if no problem.Tried a replacement and the second one is perfect from the previous problem. So it may be just statistically bad luck.....So, pay attention to your photo before getting excited with the happy recording.""

If you don't expect clear and bright movies or pictures you won't be disappointed. Especially indoors where grainy is normal. I don't know why but I expected more. Silly me. Since there aren't many features the Zx5 is easy to use. It seems fairly rugged and so it might be great for a day on the beach. It is sealed well enough to keep sand and moisture out. Battery life is ok. See, four good points right there. Just bring along a pin or paper clip because you may occasionally need to reset the camera after it locks up and a pin is required. The software that comes packaged with the Zx5 is fairly good and easy to use. So if you just want quick video clips of a day at the beach or a hike in the woods this camera is fine. My suggestion. Buy the camera and give it to the kids. They will have a ball taking short movies of each other. It is rugged enough to hold up to their use. And you will have fun making DVDs out of their clips.Mike""

Just get a class 6 or better SDHC card to record with. I also want to note that the camera is built for outdoors work in strong light. All the observations about low-light are interesting, but that is true for all cameras and is the reason for low-light IR cameras or providing a powerful light source to film night scenes. The ZX5 holds its own in fairly low light and I have no complaints. Great piece of engineering and I hope that Kodak keeps selling it. I value mine greatly!""

Option to replay in slow-motion and take pictures out of a video, plus effects, video-cut etc.Cons: Slow shutter-speed. Slow navigation through menu. No self-timer(!). Picture quality above water only okay; loss of contrast and color (basic know-how in photo-editing will help.) Battery not exchangeable (needs to be charged through wire.) Relatively low battery performance. No option to set screen saver or standby-mode (uses up battery life faster than necessary.)The camera is completely waterproof, but you have to be careful when using in saltwater. After using, clean off salt and sand before opening latches. Or tape off areas where salt can sit before using.

"20120121","4.0","Very Good for the Price with Some Recommended Improvements","I bought this for my wife, hoping it would replace the clumsy tape drive Sony HD video cam used on past vacations (we've gone through 4 generations of tape video cam in the last 20 years).  I wanted something she could put in her purse, but also capable of going underwater, since we had a snorkel vacation planned.  I also wanted easy digital memory access to the data when hooked to a computer.The camera is nicely packaged, ergonomic, and performs generally very well for close-up and landscape shots, and is excellent under-water.  By comparison, this low priced video cam compares very favorably with the iPhone 4s video camera both in terms of ease of use and picture quality.  However, the iPhone monitor screen is larger and has finer resolution.  Like the iPhone, the Playsport charging system is similar,  using a lightweight USB adapter for the wall plug-in.  So, say goodbye to the heavyweight transformer in the travel bag or daypack.I used the watertight Lifeproof enclosure for underwater video on my iPhone, and Playsport was much easier to handle and produced better images, even when we forgot to throw the 'underwater compensation' switch in the utility menu.  The touch screen on the iPhone doesn't work underwater, so I had to catch my breath above to turn the cam 'on' or 'off' during diving.  Playsport on/off record and zoom camera works very well underwater.  However, unlike the iPhone, the Playsport has mono-quality audio, relative to the iPhone CD quality sound recording in video mode.  When recording above water festivals and music performances on the road, the Playsport comes up short.Also, the 4x digital zoom of the Playsport pixelates during display the HD TV, when zooming of landscape scenes above water.  The monitor is fixed and small, and there's no wind slap noise reduction, so holding the cam out the car window produces a noisy audio and although the camera is easy to hold, it's hard to know what image is being taken, since the monitor is fixed on the camera body.  But, the image stabilization is good.Also, the camera doesn't come with necessary cables to connect to the computer.  I'm not too interested in the advertised direct to TV connection, as I still need to video edit the content first, and I find this easier to do with software like iMovie.  But, while the USB port is not the standard mini-USB configuration, I found that was the same as my Kindle, so I didn't need to buy another cable.  Sliding open the hatch release for the charge/usb ports is very difficult for the thumbnail.  We also had some data read error code problems with the 30g SD card at first.  Even after the SD card was initialized on the camera, it periodically gave 'out of memory' messages despite hours of video potential storage left on the 30G card.  Finally, although the lithium battery is good, it still could be better.  On an average day of traveling, my wife had to worry about power toward the end of the day of intermittent video work.Overall though, for the price, this is a great little camera.  Fix these minor problems Kodak!""

The fact that it's very rugged and waterproof (up to 10') is a bonus, especially for a kid. It is best used outside, and my one complaint is that it doesn't have a flash. It seems like an LED flash could have been easily included. It will probably be on next year's model and force me to upgrade. Planned obsolescence- the American way.As always, the Amazon transaction was excellent. I ordered the camera on Monday and received (from Hong Kong, I think) the next day with free shipping!

It's easy to use, comfortable to hold, sporty, and takes 720p video at 60fps with very little blur or slowdown. In optimal conditions (daylight, on a tripod or held very steady) this camera is easily the equivalent of products that cost two to three hundred dollars.Taking video in low light conditions isn't optimal, and the sound recording is a bit thin, but for casual family movies or fooling around with action shots, the PlaySport is great. Image stabilization helps keep the shots steady as well as some generous autofocus.The included software is very bare-bones, but if all you're doing is cutting video down and joining scenes together, it gets the job done. The PlaySport records in MP4 format, so videos should be compatible with most editing packages if you need more fancy options.My only gripe would be that you have to pay Kodak for shipping and handling to get a 'free' HDMI cable, but these are pretty cheap at many retail stores now, so you can just buy the one you want without registering for Kodak spam email. It's an HDMI micro (D) so look for that connector.Overall, I'd easily recommend this to anyone looking for a compact, rainproof digital video camera.""

"20120109","4.0","For what it is designed to do and price point B+/A-","I read all the reviews before purchasing throughout 2011 and was hesitant based on the widespread freeze up problems. I concluded the firmware update probably fixed this as the number of those reviews went down later in 2011. Bought it for Christmas 2011 and have been using for a few weeks (40 videos) at home and one vacation (indoor water park). Updated the firmware the minute I opened the box (per other reviews). It has been working great with not a single problem. Took it in the water at the water park and had no problems and great video.My only complaint (and one star reduction) was the fact that they reduced the sensor size from the previous year's model. Sensor size on these types of cameras are the downside either way and to reduce it even more is a poor choice. Having said that the video quality is still very good in proper light. I used 1080p for all but a few 'normal vacation' videos and am very happy with the quality. The quality seems to go above my expectations on the macro setting, will use that more this spring/summer.Conclusion: for $100 and waterproof 1080p/720p HD video on the fly and to share - this camera can't be beat. If you are looking for a better sensor for low light shooting, and better sound - buy the correct product which is a higher end HD camcorder.""

It is easy to hold, easy to carry and easy to learn to use.  I used it snorkeling and hiking. The underwater pictures  and videos were great as were those taken on dry land.  There is an enhanced underwater option which improved image quality further. The quality of the still images is excellent.  A toggle feature on the top button on the back allows you to easily switch back and forth between video and camera.  I was very glad to have a waterproof camera when I was caught in an unexpected rainshower.The battery lasts about 2 hours max.  Battery life is decreased by frequent cycling on and off and by any editing done on the camera. An icon appears when the battery begins to get low. I was happiest with the ultrafast SD rather than slower cards.  I purchased a 16 GB in addition to the 8 that came with the camera bundle.  I ran out of battery before I ran out of memory but than is because I was taking lots of short clips.""

Does anyone know why the full line picture clearly shows a white and a lime green color option, while both here and on Kodak.com I can only get black, red, or aqua? I know it's not that big of a deal, and I would still probably buy black or red from here because of the price difference, even if kodak did sell the lime on their website. Still, it seems really odd and pretty annoying that there are two colors pictured that seem very hard to get your hands on. I have found it from some (unkown to me before internet serching) other third party online vendors, but I wouldn't actually buy from some random website. Anyone know anything? ThanksUPDATE: I emailed Kodak, and apparently, white and green are only avaliable in certain countries. I get having different marketing for differnt countries, but this move makes NO sense. That being said, we have an answer, strange as it is. After all, this is an American company, so why wouldn't they have all colors in their own country?""

And pretty good at 1080p 30fps (not quite as good in low light). Decent 5mp stills in good light (better than my phone). waterproof feature is great (just use common sense and precaution). I like the rugged design, and simple controls. I have suction cup mounted this to my car and went 55mph on a semi bumpy/curvy road. I take it fishing with me all the time. It just feels like a solid piece of technology. I give the camera 5/52) I gave the gripping tripod a seperate review because I think it really deserved it. Just as good as a joby gorrilapod, and pretty cheap. loses a tiny bit of stiffness after a month of heavy use, but does its job well. 4/53)the remote is ok. It can basically do everything you can do on camera except the one think I needed it to do. Turn the camera on and off. Also it only works if you are behind the camera (lens not facing toward you). Not really my cup of tea, but it came in the bundle so I'm not coplaining. 3/54) Usb cable and wall adapter does what it's supposed to do. Charges when plugged into wall. Charges and connects to PC when plugged into computor. Pretty well made, but kinda bulky. 4/55) the HDMI cable is for connecting it directly to your HDTV for playback. not really a necessity but Nice to have none the less. Solid cable doesnt feel cheap. 4/56) the SD card does what its supposed to do, and does it well. I have not had any problems with it. Of course there are nicer cards out there, but this works for me. 5/57/8) the wrist strap is your typical shoestring like strap. It dosent adjust or anything you get one of these in just about every small electronic device you buy. The floating wrist strap is cool though. if you drop the waterproof zx5 in the water it just floats and you can retrieve it. Stark orange so its very easy to see in water or wherever you may misplace your camera, and it adjudt too so it's less likely to fall off. 5/5So there you go I love this little thing. You will have alot of fun finding reasons to record stuff now. If you have any questions or would like some Zx5 video just let me know in the comments. Thanks for reading.""

"20120103","4.0","Great little camcorder","This video camera works great. Have had it about 2 weeks, takes videos at 1080p that are very clear and sharp in good lighting. Video quality faids in lower lighting but is still in focus and good enough for memories. Pictures are 5mp, eh! Like I said before good enough. There is no flash but works well pic or video, down to low light. Its waterproof in my fishtank, havent had any problems. I have not tested it more than that for waterproofness. The easyshare is great, just set up the program, and everytime you plug it into your computer it downloads the pics you choose to facebook or emails your photos to up to 15 addresses. This camera seems durable. They say it is shockproof to 3ft. 8gb card that came with it, needed to be formatted which the camera said it could do, but shut down when trying to format. Not a big deal, formatted the card on my computer and it works fine. It is a kodak 8gb class 6, says 2.5 hours of record time on the screen or almost 6000 pictures. Kit came with mini-tripod, remote, hdmi cable, float wrist strap and card. remote seems cheap and pointless, probably will never use the wrist strap. Tripod kinda the same, probably wont ever use. But hdmi cable ($30) and 8Gb card ($20+) are worth getting in the bundle.Takes better video than pictures. It is a cheap camera for the quality of video, durability and easy to use features. I would give it 4.5 stars, no 5 because I dislike the internal battery. It lasts probably 3 hours now recording, but li-ion worries me for continuous charging cycles. I am sure will wear down eventually and then there is nothing to do but buy a new camera, cant just get a new battery.""

Lots of image format setting options. The wide-format video is great for immediate playback on HD LCD TV's. I got a Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC10E. A Class 10 card speed ensures it will read/write quickly, and the 16 Gigabyte size provides ample recording time for virtually any situation. I've used it skiing (in the rain & sleet) & skateboarding and the audio is pretty good as well.

"20120102","4.0","Camera works well, but remote fails","I purchased this camera for my daughter who has been using a Zx3 for over a year now.  Unfortunately, the Zx3 lens is fixed focus and she is constantly getting too close in to things in her videos, so they are frequently out of focus.  The Zx5 can focus much closer, so this is a big win for her.We aren't too fond of the built-in battery, we have two batteries for the Zx3 so one can be charging while she uses up the other.But the biggest fail in the package is the remote control.  It seems that although there are buttons on the remote for things like delete, volume, previous/next, etc, none of them work with the Zx5.  The remote can start/stop video and trigger the shutter for photos only.  It turns out that all of these functions work with the Zx3, however, which is a bit mysterious.  I think that Kodak left something out of the Zx5 firmware..  I mostly wanted the remote so that she could do better stop motion without moving the camera, so I guess it isn't a total failure, but we are disappointed with the lack of functionality.""

It is well-built; the controls and menus are easy to navigate; and the video quality is quite good for a $99 small, one sensor camcorder. Outside video clips are great, and I shot plenty of video Christmas morning inside with just the tree lights and room lamps on and was very pleased with the video results. The clips showed plenty of light, the colors were vibrant, and the clarity was surprisingly good.  The battery charge seems long-lasting since its indicator hardly moved over 2-3 days of shooting short clips. When I finished recording for the day, I just popped the SD card (8GB, Class 10) into my iMac's card reader and imported them into iPhoto. From there I can load them into iMovie. Very easy. Since I read mixed reviews about how this camera does in low light, I purchased a Simi SL 10HD video light with bracket to use in very low light situations. I didn't have to use it Christmas morning, but I have used it in a low light room at night, and although there was still some grain, overall it did an acceptable job attached to the ZX5, especially when shooting close, lighting up faces really well. I didn't try to shoot stills with the ZX5 since I have other cameras for that, and I haven't used it underwater so I can't offer any critique with either of these.  But so far, having used the camcorder for recording video clips over the holiday season in various lighting situations, I must say I'm very happy with the Kodak Playsport ZX5.""

If you can see anything in the dark clip, whatever you see will be extremely grainy.-In *okay* light conditions (example: a living room with 3 table lamps turned on), the video is still very grainy.-If filming inside and a light/something lighter is behind whatever you're filming, the camera will focus on the lighter object and darken whatever you're trying to film.-The audio only records MONO and has a constant background fuzz noise that doesn't go away even if you tamper with the microphone settings.=I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA TO=-Anyone who films sports or action type shots *OUTSIDE* who isn't concerned about audio quality.

It wouldnt take photos, change functions anything! Just froze on the last photo I took. When I got back to my room later that day I looked up the troubleshooting and found out there was a small reset button that you needed a pin or a paperclip to press. I did that and it reset. Downloaded few photos taken. Two days later while sailing and snorking, it did the same thing over and over again. Luckily I had taken the pin along just in case. I had hoped to return the camera when I came home, but unfortunately while travelling home, all the cameras were left in a cab! But wanted to write a review of my experience. Not sure if my camera or the product as a whole. On the good side, the quality of photos and video were very very good!!!""

"20111213","1.0","Kodak support is useless; they don't stand behind warranty","I've had a Zx3 for 11 months, and rarely used it. It developed a small crack on one side of the cover plate, under the water-tight cover that reveals the port connections, near the mounting screw - a stress crack. It didn't affect the performance, and, since the crack was beneath the water-tight cover, I wasn't too concerned. However, recently, I plugged it into my computer (using the cable from Kodak) and the power button flashed, then the thing went dead. Kodak had me send it off to United Camera & Binocular Repair (their authorized service center) under warranty repair. Well, needless to say, United Camera refused to honor the warranty because of the stress crack. When I objected, they sent me to Kodak, who in turn sent me back to United Camera. The fact that their circuit board has failed within warranty period is being explained away by the stress crack of their faulty design. Kodak product support is awful. I have seen similar problems with their support for their printers and I am done buying anything by Kodak. Buyer beware. If I could give it zero stars, I would.""
"20120527","5.0","Exceptional for the price","I must admit, I didn't expect much for under $100 (through Amazon). We took the ZX5 to the Caribbean to use at, around and underwater. First of all, when it claimed to render 1080p images, again, I didn't expect much for the price. So far, I've played it back on a 26' 720p monitor and the picture quality totally blew me away. Even the freeze frames are photo-worthy. The color balance was also very accurate. I went snorkeling with it on four separate occasions and expected most of the footage to have a blue tint to it, but the underwater color correction brought out the color accuracy in most of the corals, plants and fish I shot with it. I've read other reviews where the camera froze when recording long segments, but that never happened to me. I only had three minor issues: 1) the camera sometimes froze when playing back on a monitor, but I think that had to do with the fact that I was not using a high-speed HDMI cable, 2) if you don't soak the camera in clean warm water after use in saltwater, the waterproof doors eventually become very difficult to open, but I was able to do this days after the fact and the doors open just fine now, and 3) the audio is just okay. But personally, I didn't buy it for that. Bottom line: this camera rendered excellent images, well worth the price.""

We did rinse the camera with fresh water after we used it in the ocean; however, the side doors were completely corroded.  Upon arriving home, we had difficulty opening the side doors and once they were opened, I kept them closed with a rubber band for fear of breaking the latches.  I did contact Kodak and they had me send it back to them at which time, they did replace the side doors and did something else inside. They sent back my original camera and not a refurbished one.

"20120519","3.0","A Convenient Size, But A Mixed Bag As To Performance.","A Convenient Size, But A Mixed Bag As To Performance.This Kodak Zx5 Waterproof Pocket Video Camcorder is an interesting design, but its performance has been less than ideal, for me at any rate.  It is pocket sized, indeed, taking up approximately the same amount of space as will a small cellular telephone.  An item that will be attractive for amateur photographers, it nevertheless has several drawbacks that may puzzle a first-time camcorder operator.  'User friendly', it is generally easy to use, but will not always be useful, as this Zx5 has a tendency to freeze.  It has been marketed for its ability to function underwater (down to 10 feet), and it is my experience that it performs well in an aquatic environment, although saltwater definitely causes problems.  It contains a correction filter for underwater usage, and it works quite nicely, as does its auto focus. Audio quality in all types of settings is patchy, but not at all sub-standard, for its cost.  The video quality shows a good deal of graininess, but here again the camcorder's low price must be taken into consideration.  There are some definite flaws that might be bothersome to all levels of users.  Included among these is an integrated battery that must be recharged fairly often, as the life of this power source seems to be rather brief.  Because this Zx5 has a penchant for frequent freezing, a paper clip should be kept handy to depress the camera's reset button.  A single use in a saltwater situation taught me that the salt, when dried, impedes opening of the unit's locks.  This is eliminated simply by rinsing away the brine as soon as possible after usage.  Any experience an owner might have with audio editing will be helpful.  As is customary with digital zoom functions, this one is quite limited.  On balance, the price is right for this simple-to-operate camera.  The tendency to freeze probably varies as a characteristic of each unit.""

I could not open them and after troubleshooting with Kodak, I sent the camera back to the factory.  I received a new camera with my SD card, so I was fotunate.  The compartments are flimsy and often stick.  Also, the controls are not very responsive.  For the price, the ZX 5 is OK, but I would probably wait until a company improves on these flaws.  It is a great size and easy to carry when around the water.  I have really nice video of my daughter snorkeling, and the photos are acceptable.  It beats carrying around an expensive video camera and camera, and it is light enough that it does not weigh you down.

"20111205","4.0","It's decent.","Problems:I got this camera on sale, so it's worth what I bought it for ($100). I've only had a few problems with it since I've had it. Some of my video files wouldn't record correctly, for example, the video would record faster than the audio, so file is ruined. Another time I was snowboarding and after 2 minutes of record it stopped responding. I had to wait until the battery ran out and used a pencil to press reset, that video file was corrupt and couldn't record the rest of my trip.  These events only happened once each, but then again, I've only had the camera for about a month. Hopefully it doesn't happen again.Quality and lighting:Quality is okay, but I've only used 720p. Under low light conditions, I've had no trouble. I went camping with it, and my fire was pretty damn small. The video color itself was a lot more vibrant than I thought it would be. Vibrance is not a bad thing, but I think if your lighting is too bright, the colors will look unnatural.Battery:Battery life is pretty long. I bought a portable battery charger called Kodak Essentials for back up, I still haven't used the charger. By the end of the day, it's half charged.Focus:Focusing is slow for up close. I mean really, up close. On auto focus, it could focus up to about 2-3 inches w/o macro mode, but if you pull away too fast, it'll take a few seconds to refocus, and sometimes it would focus at all without moving it back and forth a little bit.Is it really water proof?I was always skeptical about water proof stuff so I was really worried it wasn't water proof, even if it says, water proof. But it IS. If you're as skeptical as me, I'll let you know, it really is. Although if you were, you wouldn't listen to me. I dropped it in snow, held it out in the rain, and put it in my sink with running water. Still works. Just make sure the SDcard cover and USB cover is sealed tightly...Lightweight,It is super light weight. While snowboarding, I thought I lost it several times because I couldn't feel it in my pocket and I would forget I was holding it every now and then.That's all I really have to say abou this camera. If you want something you can pull out during an adventure and post on youtube and you don't mind it randomly screwing up a clip every now and then, this is a decent camera. But I only got this camera, because I couldn't afford a GoPro HD.""

"20111202","5.0","Best PocketCam on the market. HANDS DOWN","For $109 this is the very best PocketCam on the market, no competition whatsoever still here in late 2011.I bought mine locally in June for a heftier price, but I have had nothing but a great experience with my Kodak PlaySport ZX5.I was lucky enough to had access to the earlier model, the ZX3, I borrowed it from a friend last summer for a camping trip. It worked great and I was very impressed with it.The OBVIOUS improvements with the ZX5 are small but worth the extra $10 or so over a new ZX3. If I already had a ZX3 I would have a harder time deciding if I would upgrade, but in the end I know me and I know I would step up to the ZX5.The improvements I noticed was the awesome quality of the LCD display itself compared the ZX3 and other brands I have used. The anti-glare feature is a huge plus, in the blaring sun I had no issues seeing every detail in the display. At night this model had a slight advantage over the ZX3 and a few other pocketcams I've used. I recorded about 2 hours of footage of wildlife at night in the rain and the video turned out amazing. Only light was the moon and our distant camping lantern. In the city, specifically downtown Minneapolis at night, I have gotten some great footage and the quality is more than acceptable.Another improvement is the macro feature. I needed to take close-ups of plant foliage and bugs and the ZX3 was OK but when I first used the ZX5 for the same purpose the difference was amazing. I got much improved details in video and picture quality, this upgrade alone is worth the change for me as I do a lot of close-up videos and pics of smaller items in large environments. The quality of the pictures is more than acceptable but nothing great, most smartphones probably have better cameras but it's definitely good enough. I remember having an HP camera back in the day that did 3MP and I thought those were good, so a 5MP in today's standards on a piece of equipment like this is fine for me.The smaller lenses sensor is actually better than the original on the ZX3, a much wider angle view and the quality upgrade although not very noticeable is noticeable. This sensor is definitely an improvement over the first. Don't be fooled by some reviews that claim it's worse, they fail to understand that bigger is not always better, especially in the pocketcam world.Many also do not like the 'fixed' battery. I love it. Sure it would be nice to be able to switch out batteries when needed, but being this camera and it's battery can film at 720p at 60 frames for hours, I did almost 4 hours on and off, mostly on, before mine went low to where I needed to plug in it. A little planning doesn't hurt. But if your main issue with this camera is you can't film enough with the battery life given, you need to by a professional camcorder already.Again, the two biggest negatives I have seem from legit buyers is the smaller sensor and the fixed battery. These to me are NON-ISSUES and had ZERO factor in me deciding my purchase.Another negative I see is that it freezes during filming, this was due to old firmware and the latest update fixes this issue. I never had the issue, but a friend with a ZX5 did and she did the update and it never froze again. Anyone buying a new ZX5 after August doesn't really even need to worry about the update. If you look closely at the 1 and 2 star reviews, most of them complain about this issue and if you notice the last complaint was many months ago. The issue is fixed so it's a MOOT issue. The ZX5 does not deserve so many 1 and 2 star ratings. A good percentage of these folks are giving bad reviews because they needed a professional camcorder and were too cheap to go buy one.Going over the upgrades again, the focus range is much improved, the macro feature is GOLD, records in .MP4 which is THEE standard currently and a huge improvement over the .mov files on the ZX3, indestructible, feels very comfortable and natural in hand, for $100 what more do you want?If you're debating between other pocketcams just end that debate and go with the ZX5.If you're debating between a pocketcam and a regular or professional camcorder, all you really need to know is what you plan on using the cam for. For 90% of the populations need, the Kodak ZX5 meets and exceeds those needs.I will be buying two of these from Amazon for Xmas gifts.NOTE: Don't skimp on a the SDHC card, get the class 10. I buy Fuji but it's the only brand I've ever used so I can't comment on the other cheaper brands. Even the Sony cards have had issues, but to each their own.NEW AS OF 12/9/2011-I just bought another Zx5 for my brother and I will be buying another for a friend for Xmas. This comment is now from a VERIFIED AMAZON PURCHASER. lol My Zx5 I've had since early summer 2011 and I paid a much higher price than what's offered here now.

"20111125","4.0","Pretty cool for the price","I haven't tried the built-in software by connecting a computer.  I downloaded KMPlayer from CNET.com as it can play this camera's .MP4 files.  If you have Windows XP or Vista I recommend you download KMPlayer.  If you have Windows 7 you are OK as Windows Media Player can play .MP4 files. I just pop the flash card into my laptop's media port and copy the video files to my computer. I then use KMPlayer and open the file to watch the video. I would like to find a way to burn DVDs but would have to convert the .MP4 files first. As for problems the camera is being faulted for I already upgraded the bios on this camera. It is supposed to fix the SDHC class 10 problem as well as the occasional freezing up.  I have not tested the camera yet with a class 10 SDHC flash card so I can't comment if this fix worked.  Right now I am using a class 6 card.  You get a lot of bang for the buck with this camera.  Just remember its limits and you will be OK.  For outdoors in the daylight you are fine.  Indoors with bright lights you should be OK too.  I do not plan on using it underwater.  I just like the idea of water resistant camera.  I wish it had a lens cap but I suppose I can clean the lens once in a while. You have about a couple hours and you are done shooting.  It then takes hours to charge again.

So I would say it a fair second camera, I personally would not use it as my main camera but it is good for quick shots in good light.As a video camera as long as you have fair light and use the hd record mode it takes very good movies zoom is easy to use pic quality is very good and mic is very sensative. The first time I used it I didnt realize the tv was on in the back ground but once we replayed the video it was picked up extremly well by the built in mic. I have not tryed it underwater but expect it to be about the same.so overall great for video/ fair for camera, maybe they will put a little lite and flash on the next model. as for battery it holds a good long charge.

"20111109","3.0","Average Performance (No more Kodak Rip-off)","Here's my 2-day below-average experience with the Kodak PlaySport Zx5:1) Zx5 has micro HDMI port for HDTV hookup; however, the MICRO HDMI cable does *not* come w/ the camera.  You can register at Kodak to get a 'free' cable; however, just getting to the point where you receive an email from Kodak with the promo code for a free cable is a nightmare.  It took two days after I had registered and two support chat-sessions before I was able to get the promo code from the representative.2) Note I had put -free cable- under quotes in my previous point.  That is because Kodak charges $6.50 to ship the cable.  The shipping charges for a cable ~3ft cable cannot be $6.50.  Kodak seems to be making buyers pay for the cable and label the charges as 'shipping' charges.3) My first two video shots were indoor in a brightly lit room.  The video resolution tested were: 720p & 720p@60fps.  Videos were pixelated & audio quality was at-best muffled/poor.4) My third video shot was taken at 720p@60fps from inside of a moving car on a nice sunny day.  Video quality was pretty good; however, audio quality was horrible.  For the purpose of testing, I had my mouth about 2-feet away from the microphone with all windows closed.In a nutshell:* Kodak, although a reputable company, seems to sell products that perform below par.  Not to mention the sales gimmick Kodak employs to 'force' customers to register for a 'free' cable that cost $6.50.* Poor video quality when taken indoor or in the evening.* Poor audio quality* I would look at other alternatives instead of purchasing Zx5.* Would not recommend Zx5.* I'll think twice before purchasing any Kodak products in the future.******************************************************!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+-------------UPDATE: 11/16/2011---------------------+!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!******************************************************Seems like Kodak is *no* longer charging the $6.50 shipping & handling fees.  This is what I expect from a respectable company.  Ideally the company should have provided the uHDMI cable in the box instead of using marketing tactics to force customers to register.  In any case, I am upgrading the rating from 1-star to 3-stars.  1/2-star for not charging S&H.  Additional 1.5-stars for 'realized' Functionality & Performance (F&P).  The updated information on F&P will be posted soon.For now, I would recommend this product for someone who needs portable recording capability for short video recordings.+===================================================+""

Made sure that the doors were tight, took it in literally 5 or 6' of water, it got moisture behind the lens, dried it out just like the directions state and now it doesnt work.  Sending it in to Kodak for repair.  Kodak tells me many times were not assigning blame, but if....blah blah.  I know that you are going to tell me it's not covered and that its my fault the camera got wet inside.  I made sure that the doors were latched just like the directions say, the manual even stated that water may get in, but to just dry it out, but that didnt work, useless.

"20111015","5.0","Great value","I purchased the Zx5  from Amazon for $109 a month ago and it has performed very well in a variety of quite demanding tasks:- Recording a camping / boating trip to Lake Mojave- Documenting a trip to the Sierras for a land conservancy activity- Recording a horse  to sell using YouTube- Pictures of our family and property in California to show folks in the UK (which requires switching from NTSC to PAL)The camera performed all these tasks  to my complete satisfaction. Simple but adequate controls help deliver very acceptable results, and the products rugged specs encourages the user to use it in situations where I would not risk taking my other high end digital cameras.Frustrations? A few.1. There's no way that I can see to take the output from the included MediaImpression software and export it back to the camera. (The camera has  HDMI connect  and NTSC/PAL outputs, which my laptop does not). So there's no way use the camera to connect direct to say a relatives TV and view edited video in HD.2. The video shooting has no pause so each shoot becomes a separate file.3. The optional remote is difficult to use and frequently skips pictures and videos during replay via a TV4. Despite using a class 10 memory chip, the camera sometimes stops when in 720P/60, unable to write to memory fast enough.But at the price, this product represents outstanding value.""

The $500 or $800 japanese camcorders have more technically excellent features, but short video clips, with resolution rates that don't take all day to upload thru my broadband cable internet connection - that's better for me.

You could remove files from it, charge it, just not see anything on the screen. I Wanted it for Jamaica so we went to walmart and bought another one. On the trip, I noticed that it wouldn't hold a charge (new one). It will work if plugged in, but no matter how long or what connection used it won't charge. It tells you that it's charging but as soon as you disconnect power source it says 'insufficient battery' and shuts down.

Durability is great.

"20110911","3.0","Good for its price, but not for marine shooting","Camera is good for its price. But it has a significant flaw - SD & USB covers design making camera 'a single use' when shooting in the sea. The hatch door lock itself is not waterproof. The latch contains a tiny ball stopper. As a result salty water gets into the lock, dries out and locks the ball forever with no way to open a hatch - thus you can't get your SD back. Mine got stuck after only two days of usage. Lucky me the first hatch to lock down was an SD side - so I have managed to download movies using USB link before the second one got stuck. 3 days in fresh water tank does not solve a problem.""
"20110911","4.0","Take it everywhere!","I've used this little camera all summer long and it works great.  I took it to the pool, amusement parks, the beach and didn't worry once about getting it wet.  The still photo picture quality is good and the 1080 HD quality video is fantastic for such a small device.  However, the sound quality is sub-par.  I knew that the sound was mono when I purchased it, but there are problems.  For example, if you submerge the camera in water and then take it out of the water, the sound quality is muffled and doesn't sound good until it dries.  I've noticed this every time.  Also, wind is big factor of degrading sound quality as well. Despite the negative sound quality, the video features and water proof qualities still make this camera worth every penny.  Battery life is good as well.  I purchased a 16GB SD card and can fit almost 3 hours of video and 11,000 photos.  I actually like that the battery is internal, but expect to charge it often.""
"20110909","4.0","??? about the complaints.","Got the camera last week and I'm surprised at the good quality for the price.  I got this when my Zx3, which was great for the price, died on me when some sea water broke through the rubber gasket.  I live in Hawaii and use it 3 times a week so I cannot complain.I'm not sure what the numerous complaints are on the low light, but mine seems to be pretty good unless you go into very, very low light.  I think the new Zx5 is actually a bit better compared to Zx3 for the semi-low lighting.I do wish the battery was removable like the old one since I had extra batteries for backup.  Also, the HDMI cable on the old one does not fit so I had to order it free from Kodak($10.50 shipping to Hawaii).  Perhaps the water damage issues is the reason why they got rid of the removable battery...my guess.Overall, the quality vs. the price is awesome.  Yes, you are not going to get cinema quality for a $110 camera.  But for all it DOES offer especially in Hawaiian waters, I am ecstatic.Good job Kodak!""

"20110905","4.0","Decent camera for a great price","I bought this a few days ago for $150 and am very pleased with it so far. As one would expect filming in low light indoor situations, the recording is a bit pixelated - but if you're only planning on watching the video on your computer screen (in a small window), it's not too noticeable. It's a solid but light weight camera - it easily fits into your pocket and it's very durable. When purchasing it I didn't notice that the battery wasn't removable which means that you can't pop in a fully charged back up when the first battery runs out; however, when charged, it does last 4+ hours which is more than enough for me. This recorder is great for the novice who plans on filming the kids or pets, vacation highlights, and candid moments. If you plan on only filming in low light, making professional quality videos, or filming for extended periods of time (over 4 hours) - spend several hundred more for a better camera.""

The good:  it seemed to take pretty good video, the controls are easy to understand and the software to unload video and images seem to work well.  The video 'effects' were nice too.  The 5mb still images were average and only good for portraits.  You do not want to zoom in still mode; pictures were always blurry.  The battery life was pretty good.The bad:  I ordered two of these.  The first one I got heated up like a hot plate when I first charged it.  I got online with Kodak and the rep told me to just return it, which I did.  Never actually used the first one.  The second one I got charged fine, but the more I used it, the more difficult it became to open the sealed doors to charge it or to remove the SD card.  (I actually can't get the SD card out at the moment).  This pretty much renders it useless.  I am only 6 weeks into using the product and can't charge it or get the images out of it.  Also, I did order the HDMI cable to plug it into my TV. (Kodak will send you this free if you pay the shipping.)  I plugged that in and the image would pop in and out, in and out.  I never could get a consistent display on my TV.  I would have bought the remote if this function just worked right.

"20110829","5.0","Just what we needed","This is exactly what we were looking for in a video camera.  Small, easy to use, works well, takes video and pictures, relatively cheap in price and fun.  Lets be honest, this is not the top of the line video camera with a huge amount of megapixels or features.  This is a perfect camera for someone who wants to take decent video of their outings etc.  The video quality is as good as I expected from a camera of this size and quality.  That is not to say that it is bad.  It is actually really good.  Just not top of the line.  We do not have any grainy issues except when you zoom in all the way.  Audio is pretty decent as well.  The only time we have issues with audio is when we have it in the underwater mode.  The sound can be a bit muffled at times.  That is to be expected from that mode.  The only issues we have had is that a few times when it records something it seems to record in 2x speed.  I am not sure if it is because we are trying to record small videos one right after another in quick sequence or what.  Also, when playing back on the TV with the FREE HDMI cable from Kodak the camera will freeze at times.  That is frustrating.Overall this is an awesome camera for getting shots of the family and fun.  The underwater feature is incredible.  It really works very well and takes great video and pictures.  The fact that we can take it into the pool and get shots without worrying about ruining a cell phone or other camera is awesome.  We really like this camera and are very pleased with our purchase.""
"20110824","4.0","Finally, an ultra compact with auto focus, albeit slow","First of all, this is a really great product for an ultra compact camcorder. However there is one feature you should really know about when deciding which ultra compact video camera to buy. This factor is related to focus. There are two types of focusing lenses - fixed focus and auto focus.Kodak Zx3 Playsport, Zi8, Playtouch - all have a fixed focus lens. Which means 'most' of what you shoot will be in focus, but not sharp in focus. This is perfectly acceptable for most stuff you shoot at around 6 feet from the camera. But this feature is also completely unacceptable for things you shoot up close. I'm not talking macro (macro is like really close, subjects around 2 cm from the camera). The exclusion of auto focus AND a missing macro mode is a deal killer with the Zx3 and Zi8. So I went with the Zx5 instead of the Zx3.Kodak Zx5 - This has a (slow) autofocus lens but it does a fairly good job if you want to get the right things in focus. In addition, it has a macro switch for very close subjects like coins, flowers, insects etc. To me these two features are a HUGE plus for an ultra compact. Yes, as you might have read elsewhere, the auto focus is a bit slow but something is better than nothing.How does the Zx5 compare to the other ultracompacts:The Zx5 excels in video quality compared to the Flip Ultra HD, the Sanyo Xacti as well as the Sony Bloggie. The Flip has a smaller sensor and the video quality is lower than that of the Zx5.  Other ultra compacts models (other than the Flip, Xacti and the Bloggie) are not even worth considering for comparison. Out of all these, the Sony Bloggie is the only other ultra compact video camera with auto focus. The Flip Ultra HD has a pop out USB port which helps, which is missing in the Zx5.Summary of the Zx5:Pros:+Very rugged and well built, also shockproof (compared to the Zx3 which is not)+Light weight and can be kept in your pocket like a small cell phone+No need to worry about it getting wet+Auto focus, albeit very slow+Videos are recorded in VBR mode - variable bitrate, which uses an advanced algorithm to optimize storage space with no difference in visual quality. Video sizes are about 3 times smaller in the Zx5 compared to the Zx3 with no visible loss in quality.+ Cool capture effects are good if you use itCons:- Fixed battery (Come on Kodak, you could have done better). But the battery does last longer than a replaceable one- Focusing could have been faster but is tolerable- Menus could have a pop up description or at least some text to make it user friendly- Slightly less wide than the Zx3, which gives the Zx5 videos a little cropped look, this is negligible to me though- Container could have been the more famous MP4 as used by other ultra compacts instead of MOV, however these containers can be interchanged loslessly (the internal video is still x264 and audio is still AAC). Looks like Kodak was trying to go the Apple/Mac way and not the Windows and I don't really blame them looking at the recent popularity of Apple- no optical zoom but hey its an ultra compact after allConclusion:There are so many ultra compacts to choose from today and it really becomes confusing on which one to choose. At the time of this writing (Aug 2011), The PlaySport Zx5 one is the best overall ultra compact video cameras available. You will have to sacrifice some features to get what you want and this is overall the best in my opinion. For this price, you should go for it, you wont be disappointed. Happy shooting!""
"20110823","4.0","REVIEW ON THE KODAK PLAYSPORT","I received the product in a timely manner, just a couple of days before my Costa Rica trip. And for the most part, I was really impressed. Although I wish that I knew it didn't have a light or a flash. And the picture quality isn't that good. But all in all, the price was right, the shipping was perfect and I used the camera and am still enjoying using it.  So I'm a happy camper!""
"20110823","2.0","Bad purchase","I recently (6/20/2011) purchased this camera(Zx5), it sucks. I did the firmware updates to the device and the video on it is still horribly choppy. The underwater does not come out clear. It has no flash, nor recording light. So in all but bright light you see only shadows. In good lighting however it does take great pictures (hence the 2nd star).""
"20110822","1.0","Died after a day","I was excited to take this camera on a family trip to Hawaii. I packed it with me and took it on the trip. The first day was great. I took it to the beach and got some great shots of the kids playing in the surf. The second day, I tried to get some shots underwater while snorkeling and the camera suddenly froze. I followed the trouble shooting instructions of drying it out for 24 hours but it never came back to life. Since I was in Hawaii, there was no quick and easy way to get a replacement. Ended up not having any underwater camera for my snorkeling trip to Molokini crater. Extremely disappointing. Wasted money on the camera for a trip during which it lay dead.It is possible I got a bad item, but since it worked out of the box for one day and died during its first real foray underwater, I don't think this camera is very reliable. The side covers were solid and kept all the slots bone dry. However, there was moisture behind the lens when the camera died.""
"20110820","5.0","great product so far","so far 4 trips to beach, 2 water parks, several rainy days, and a couple of dips in a pool and this thing delivers.  4 and 6 year old kids love snapping pictures with it and making their own movies.  its nice not worrying whether they drop it or not.  so far no issues.  would recommend one of those cans of compressed air to clean door mechanisms but not necessary.  using with 8 gig class 6 and works great.  highly recommend.""

"20110820","2.0","Worked OK... when it worked","It's an OK camera for the price.  Ours had one fatal flaw though.  About 5-10% of the movies we took would have the video get out of sync with the sound.  The video would go really fast for half of the shot and then really slow for the second half.  The sound would be the normal speed the entire time.  Since the video was fast then slow, it would end at the same time as the sound.  It was unwatchable though.  We lost a few good shots of our vacation because of it.For the rest of the shots, things were better.  We took a lot of pool and beach footage with it and with another camera we have.  The colors on the Zx5 were really muted compared with the other camera.  Skin tones were grainy but tolerable.  A lot of action in the shot made it a bit difficult to watch but that comes with the compression I guess.Overall we decide to return this one.  I can't have a great shot ruined by a camera malfunction.""

However, this model was not as liked. Took okay HD video that looks good at small sizes (but a bit over-saturated.) Full sized review of the video (at bright daylight) show noticeable noise/grain. Adjustments to video quality setting make little or no difference. Still photo quality was good and acceptable when a better camera is not available.Worst part of camera was that is froze while driving back from an excursion and could not be reset or used after that point. Overall disappointed with the finished product quality. It was returned to Amazon.""
"20110814","3.0","Grandson with new video camera","I bought this camera for my grandson, age 11, as he wanted to start taking movies of skate boarding.  I was disappointed that it wasn't made clear that you needed a memory card immediately in order to use it.  The camera had 11 seconds of memory and that certainly won't take a movie.I bought a memory card locally, 8mg.  That cost $30 plus tax.  He went a week without being able to try out the new camera.I would just suggest that you or Kodak make that known before purchasing.

"20110812","5.0","Works as expected.","Overall we are very pleased with this product. We purchased this for it's intended purpose of going where we would not want to bring our non waterproof cameras. Underwater shots came out great, and this little device performed much better than expected under low light conditions. It's simplicity is where it really shines.  An on button and 4 other buttons, nothing unnecessary.  Start-up is almost instantaneous, and switching between video and picture modes a painless press of a button. Sand got into all the crevices while at the beach, and if not kept clean I can see the possibility of water penetration.  Audio was muffled at times, but this may be due to water covering the mic area and not necessarily a flaw with the camera.  The video has no problem keeping up with fast action, and I didn't even test the mode suited for that.""
"20110810","4.0","Good Camera","I'm happy with this purchase.  I have not experienced the freezing other reviews spoke of.  It's user friendly and  very portable! Only con I found is that the frame is kind of small when shooting horizontally.

Would recommend for those who want a light weight, easy to use video camera that can be tossed in a bag and ready when you are.""
"20110809","4.0","Not a bad camera for the price","I purchased this camera because I needed something lightweight and portable for taking vacation videos and family gatherings.  It is very light and small.  Smaller even than my smartphone.  I have not used it underwater, but did use it in a rainstorm, so I can vouch for it's ability to function while wet.  In a stable environment, the camera does well enough on video.  My concern is the sound.  I used it at a couple of outdoor concerts and noticed a problem with a fluctuation in sound level.  I had recently installed an update to fix a problem with the audio and video not matching.  That seems somewhat corrected, but the concern over sound fluctuation makes me afraid to use it.  The zoom is digital and therefore useless.If you are planning to use it casually and in close distance it is a good camera for the price.  I liked the fact that the rain did not harm its function.  I am hoping to try it underwater at the beach snorkelling and will update the review if it works well.""
"20110809","4.0","Works Well","I read other reviews and was concerned about things like the integral battery, but the other features such as the macro function (which I have yet to use) made it a sale for me. In addition, as my FIRST digital camera that I have purchased, up to now I have been using an old 3.3 MP hand-me-down, the price was such that I didn't feel that I was investing a huge amount of money and had to get it right on the first try. One other reason I got it was because it is waterproof so if I get caught in the rain I won't worry like I would for my older 3.3 MP camera. That kind of was a major point to me.When I got it the camera was surprisingly (to me) small. The instructions seemed pretty straight forward though I don't know what some of the features will actually do. Operating the camera was pretty straight forward in either video or still modes.I am not a picture or video taker and, as noted, this is my first purchase of a digital video camera. I took it on a trip that occurred shortly after it arrived and found it pretty easy to keep around as opposed to being left behind unless I expected to take a picture or video -- a fact that it is taking me time to get used to.I have installed the software though I have yet to make much use of it. I probably missed something but I have an impression that I couldn't drag and drop from the camera to the computer, but I'll work it out one way or another.The only thing, right now, that I would like is for the battery indicator to be more accessible and that the level of power be more discernable (when full the indicator appeared as a whiteish battery with no indication of whether it was full or not (obviously since freshly charged one might presume it was full) and it momentarily appeared and then disappeared. Once the battery drops below full it shows an indicator. I found no way to bring it up which in the event of heavy use I might want to do to see how much battery life was left.I am quite happy with the purchase even if I am not a picture or video taker by nature.""
"20110807","4.0","Fun for a Very Reasonable Price","Bought this for my husband ... we used it on vacation to take both videos & still shots.  I loved most being able to use it during snorkeling up to 10 ft ... I couldn't find any other similar pocket camcorder that was waterproof.  The pictures taken while the camera is at maximum zoom are not as crisp as one would like, but for the price and considering we are novices, I don't think this camera can be beat.""

"20110803","3.0","Review of Kodak PlaySport ZX5","I purchased the Kodak PlaySport ZX5 for use on vacation.  The build quality was solid, no issues taking this camera in several pools, a hot spring, and in the rain, and on various hikes - at least in terms of the hardware.  Latches for the data ports and memory card were secure.  The auto focus worked well, didn't experience much blurring or focus hunting as on some other video cameras.  Really in terms of the hardware build and general rugged design this was a great little camera to keep in the pocket and have available to record in environments that you might not want to expose a higher cost device.  But the software ...1) The camera would lockup several times a day due to the Class 10 memory card I had purchased with the camera.  This was incredibly frustrating while on vacation, as it would often not turn off when locked up.  I took to carrying around a pin to press the hidden reset button.  I had to copy video to my notebook PC several times a day, because the only fix to get the camera working again was to do the hard reset, and then reformat the memory card.  After the vacation I learned of the issue with Class 10 memory cards, installed the updated driver software from Kodak, and did not have the camera lockup again.  But not so good on the part of Kodak to sell me a camera in July with such a critical driver issue, when the new driver had been out already for a while.2) On approx 10% of the videos recorded in 720p 60 frame rate mode, the videos played back in double time, so persons are walking around fast.  (Like the Benny Hill show if you have seen it.)  This happened on the camera during playback, on my TV and on two different PCs using both Windows Media Player and VLC.  So I think it was an issue with the camera not the playback devices.  Note: this also stopped happening after the driver update.3) I can hold a camera very still even when panning.  Yet occasionally I got some very jumpy video.  Not jumpy because of camera movement, but jumpy and frame skipping even though the camera was mostly still.  Didn't occur often.  I would like to have had the option of turning off the electronic stability feature (as you can on the earlier ZX3).  ES can introduce some odd things when it thinks you want to keep the camera still but really you may want to do a slow pan.  Why Kodak removed the ability to turn it off is puzzling.  I think they wanted to make the ZX5 better for persons who do not know what they are doing, but it hurts those of us who like more manual control.  Note: after the driver update I did not encounter this issue.As mentioned in some other reviews, the 1080p mode can look like it is stuttering a bit during faster pans, but that is the nature of the beast in some respects.  As long as you take camera movements into account at the 30 frame rate, you can do OK and the image is nice on an HD TV, at least for a camera of this price range.  You just have to be more aware of what you are doing with the camera.  And the 720p 60 frame rate can be nice to handle movement.Bottom line though, I had to return the camera.  As mentioned, I installed the new driver, but only had two days before I could no longer return the camera.  In some testing during those two days, I did not encounter any of the 3 software related issues mentioned above.  But I simply did not have enough time to be sure the issues were completely gone.  I would like to have kept the camera, had Kodak provided a driver software that worked properly from the get go.  I might even consider purchasing this camera in the future again, because I liked it quite a bit, but only if I could be assured the software issues are a thing of the past.  If software issues are resolved at this time, then I could recommend this camera as a rugged compact device, that you can use especially outdoors (needs a reasonable amount of light for best picture quality), to record your various adventures where a more expensive or bulky device would not be a good fit.""
"20110803","5.0","Super little camera","Went on a Niagara Falls vacation trip and was the perfect small camera for those high moisture memories.Maid of the Mists boat tour, Journey beneath the Falls.  Great stills and videos.It will do the job.Also went on a cruise vacation to the Caribbean in November 2011. This experience compels me to offer a helpful hint.  If you take the camera into the ocean, you will probably want to rinse it in fresh water before putting it away.

"20120517","4.0","Great Little Camera","I bought this camcorder to take with me on my wedding and honeymoon aboard a cruise ship. My fiancee and I had been together for over 10 years, so we knew that we wanted to document this occasion above and beyond the normal wedding photos (and vacation photos).I literally carried this camcorder in my right pocket for our entire trip (it is actually a little smaller than my cell phone, so I hardly noticed it). When there was a good opportunity to get video of something, I'd take it out, press the power button, and in about 2 seconds I'd be recording. I've always used larger camcorders and I find that I never seem to have it with me when I want to video something.Considering this is a $100 handheld camcorder, the quality of the video is excellent. Midway through the trip, we used an HDMI cable (bought separately on Amazon with a bundle of accessories for this device) to plug the camcorder into the TV in our cabin and watch the video we had gotten so far and everything was crystal clear.Two questions people ask themselves about purchasing a camera like this (when they've never owned one):1. Why wouldn't I just use my cell phone camcorder that also records in HD?Answer: The waterproof feature of this device answers this question pretty well all on its own. You will get so much cooler video opportunities (I got some great video underwater in Cozumel in a snorkeling area!) than you ever could with your cell phone. Personally, I just prefer to have a dedicated camcorder as well. I took 51 videos in one week on my honeymoon with this camcorder, and maybe 2-3 videos in the two years that I've owned my Droid. Not to mention, if you're taking more than just a few minutes of video in a single day you'll find out that there's just not enough battery life on most cell phones to take video all day AND use your phone for all the other things you use it for.2. If this device is so good, why does ANYONE buy full sized camcorders?Answer: Zoom. You can zoom a little on this phone, but I wouldn't recommend it. This phone is meant for general/personal use at reasonably close range. For most people, this is going to be 75% or more of their camcorder use. In the 51 videos I took on my honeymoon, only one of them turned out poorly. On the last day, there were dolphins jumping out of the water at a distance (about 300 yards from the ship) and I just couldn't quite get a good video of it. I tried zooming in, but the more you zoom, the more blurry the picture becomes if you're trying to focus on something that's very far away. Still captured the memory, though! And I had no chance of getting that on a still camera!The only complaint I have about this camera is that the little water-tight doors that cover up the USB and HDMI port on the left side and the memory card on the right side have a tendency to get stuck if you use this camera at the beach. Inevitably, a grain of sand is going to get stuck inside the latch and it will take a little work to get that little door open. It's not a huge deal, but you'll have to use something (I used the handle from fingernail clippers) to pry it open and then just keep flipping the latch until the sand falls out. It's a minor nuisance, but I think Kodak could have probably designed those latches a little better.Overall, I love this camera. For $85, you can't beat this!""
"20120514","5.0","Unbelievable Bargain HD Video Cam!","HD 1080 30fps or 720 60fps for under $100? Sounds too good to be true, but this hand videocam is really a great deal! I guess Kodak's bankruptcy is our (consumers) gain. Retailers seem to be dumping this product out at cut-rate prices, though I think Kodak will survive after reorganizing after bankruptcy. Watch for local ad sales, since one week after I purchased mine on Amazon, Target advertised an even lower price (which Amazon later matched, then raised after Target's sale ended). Best for shots outdoors in bright light, videos played much clearer on HDTV versus my laptop PC.For the newer Zx5 model, you have to buy the SD card and HDMI cable separately. Buy the HDMI cable on Amazon. While Kodak offers one for free after registering the product, its shipping charge is higher than the product price on Amazon! One issue with the cable is that on my TV, the Playsport has to be connected while off, and after changing to the HDMI input setting on the TV, then turn the Playsport on. On my first attempt, I had the camera on, and when I tried to adjust the TV input setting, it froze my camera! You have to reset by using a paperclip to press the reset pinhole button located between the cable ports on the camera (with the Zx5's internal battery, you can't reset by taking the battery out...).""
"20120514","2.0","Amazon selling REFURBISHED ZX5's instead of NEW","*EDIT/UPDATE; MAY 15After speaking with another representative, I was told conflicting information. This second representative says a refurbished product from Kodak will have a 'REFURBISHED' sticker ON the box. He also stated that the on the camera itself, NOT above the serial #, will be a sticker marked (A) or (B), although these letters will vary in what they symbolize depending on the serial #. Since I had already returned my camera, I could not provide a serial number.______________________________________________________________________Long story short, there was dirt, dust, hair, missing wraps and empty wraps, and plenty of sloppy scotch tape that entailed this order from amazon. One representative told me it was definitely refurb. due to the letter 'B' on the inside flap. A second representative said there is no way of knowing unless Kodak places stickers on the product.If the package ships from an amazon return center, that just might be a clue that the product is not new. They were stupid enough to put 'RETURNS CENTER' in big bold letters on my package.Most likely Amazon is re-packaging and re-taping returned ZX5's. Not a big deal, but since I plan on taking this camera underwater, I want the assurance that nobody has tampered with it.******Update; May 14 2:44 PM ESTIt turns out Amazon is no longer directly selling the ZX5. It seems like they were trying to get rid of all their inventory as soon as possible, even if that meant shipping out refurbished products labeled 'NEW'.Guys, shop around for these. Best buy is selling these new, free shipping, with a free 8gb class 4 SD card included. Just ordered mine from them and will report back if that one is also refurbished. Camera from amazon has been returned. I will post a review pertaining to the camera itself after a few months of outdoor use.""
"20120513","4.0","Works with my mac","This camera, for me, fits the bill. It is inexpensive. It works. and it works with my mac. I have imovie '08 and iphoto. My mac is a 10.5.8  As soon as I got the camera I charged it (that takes a while) and then shot some footage. Then I plugged it into my mac using the usb cable that comes with the camera. This opened Iphoto and I downloaded it directly into iphoto. I played it and burned it from iphoto with ease. Next I will try moving it from iphoto to imovie. Yes, it can be grainy at times in quality. But for the price, I am not complaining. The one very bad thing is that battery is not removable. Once the battery is gone, your camera is gone. But again, for the price, can't complain. I also bought a bigger more expensive chip to put in it as I have read using the smaller chips can lead to freeze ups. I got mine at bestbuy- it was cheaper than on amazon... so shop around...""

"20120508","3.0","Good but freezes","This camera is a good value for the price, but as other reviews detail it has a tendency to freeze up at which point you must wait for the battery to fully drain. I used this camera extensively for a 2 week trip through South Africa. I used it daily under a variety of conditions, day, night, wet, etc. It froze twice. Both times it froze I got a bit of a warning. The camera would start acting 'goofy' by having trouble focusing or not recording immediately. Soon after these symptoms the camera would freeze regardless of whether I restarted or recharged the unit. Once the symptoms started it seemed to be inevitable that it would fail shortly.  As you can imagine losing the camera for the day can be very frustrating, especially on safari.Otherwise, during the majority of use the camera was easy to use and worked well. I'd recommend getting a quality memory card (not the generic sandisk I started with) or else you may get little lines and buzzing sounds in the playback.""

"20110727","4.0","A great camera for the price","This a great camera/camcorder for the price, and it works as advertised.  The other users who have had bad experiences probably got defective units, but mine is working great.  I would suggest exchanging them for a new one.  Also be sure to use quality SD memory cards and have the latest firmware.  My thoughts below...I took this camera with me on a tropical vacation with the intent to shoot underwater photos and videos, and it worked out great!  There is an option in the settings menu to color-correct for underwater use.  If you don't turn this on, your photos and videos will come out with a green tinge.  Remember to turn this on for underwater use!There are 4 different options for video shooting:  1080p, 720 at 60 frames per second, 720 at 30 fps, and iPad compatible.  The 720 @ 60fps looks especially nice and crisp with the higher fps setting.  Use this setting for videos that you expect to have a lot of movement in.  The 1080p will look choppy when panning around too quickly or shooting video that has a lot of movement in it.  The 720 @ 30 fps and the iPad compatible settings are geared toward shooting video where there isn't a lot of quick movement.  Even though the 720@60 setting produced the best video, I found myself using the iPad compatible setting the most.  The file size for this setting was the smallest, and the video quality was still very good.  I was very impressed with the results.  I used a 16GB Sandisk memory card with this camera.  At the 720@60 setting, you are able to record up to 2hrs and 45 mins of total video footage and around 12000 photos.  Your mileage may vary.The camera function leaves something to be desired.  Although it takes good-not-great photos (that's what your point-and-shoot camera is for), I recommend taking photos during the daytime and un-zoomed.  The photo quality during low-light conditions or at night is extremely poor and very grainy.  This is strictly a daytime or bright light camera.  Also, the photo quality degrades significantly if you use the zoom function even in bright daytime light.  I suggest not using the zoom at all and shooting during the day or with lots of light.  The nice thing about the ZX5 over the ZX3 is the macro focus function.  If you want to take photos of objects that are very close to the camera, select this function.Reading some of the other reviews, some of the complaints centered on the access flaps for the memory card not opening properly after use in the ocean or saltwater.  The manual recommends rinsing the camera with fresh water and pat drying after exposure to saltwater.  Here's a trick I used on my vacation:  take a ziplock bag with you, partly filled with freshwater.  After using it in the ocean, drop the camera in the ziplock bag of freshwater to keep the salt from forming and gumming up the hinges of the access flaps.  Dry it and clean it off when you get home.  I recommend thoroughly rinsing it and drying it with a towel, and then opening up both sets of access flaps to dry completely.There are sharing funtions on the camera that I did not use and turned off in the settings menu.  I don't Youtube or Facebook so I did not explore these features.When unloading the photos and videos, unfortunately you cannot just remove the memory card and put that into the card reader in your computer.  You must use the ZX5 to unload them.  Hook up the ZX5 to your computer with the USB cable and turn it on.  When the computer detects it, it will want to install software.  You DO NOT have to install the ZX5 software to unload your photos/videos.  Just open up the ZX5 from 'My Computer' like you would a USB memory stick and copy/paste your photos/videos over.  It's much simpler to do that than to deal with the software.I also do not recommend using the on-camera video editing feature.  For videos that are long, the trim feature will start to lock up on you.  Offload the video onto your computer and use other video editing software to do any trimming or splicing.  Short video clips won't have this problem.Inside the box, there is an offer for a free HDMI cable if you send in a registration card.  Not everyone has HDMI on their TV or computer, so I can understand why they don't include one already.Final thoughts:  it is a great camcorder for the money.  It is extremely compact, shoots terrific video (underwater or on land), and does a half-decent job as a regular camera.  For those of you complaining about the photo quality, understand that you are using a $120 camera.  Go get a thousand dollar DSLR if you want excellent pictures.  This camera is perfect for those of you who want to take it on vacation or camping with the chance that you'll be getting wet.  Remember my tip to take a ziplock bag of freshwater if you plan to go swimming in saltwater!""
"20110727","1.0","Sadly Disappointed","I own the Kodak Zi8 which is a great cam. I heard nothing but good things about the X3 so I thought the X5 was a good choice. Kodak dropped the ball on this one. The main problem was the camera was always locking up, no matter what I tried (firmware). Other problems also hinder this camera. The doors and the locking mechanism for the USB compartment and SD card comaprtment are very hard to open (especially when wet) and get jammed and are of questionable quality.""
"20110726","5.0","Awesome","We bought this camera for a white water rafting trip! it was  sooo easy to use and def water proof...as well as drop proof! It was dropped a few times while hiking but never had an issue! We bought the extra floaty so when it fell in the water is actualy floated! Good thing too as we tossed it back in forth across a lake to shoot different angles!! Great easy camera and great price!!!""
"20110725","4.0","Good video recording with some minor issues","I've been using the Playsport Zx5 for over a week and initially I had many issues related to my slow laptop and class 2 SDHC card and bad firmware.  My recordings were choppy and laggy.  It wasn't until I used a class 6 card and connected the camera directly to my TV that I could actually enjoy my videos.  1080p recordings are really good while 720p at 60fps are not that good.  If there is one really amazing thing to mention about this camera is the macro recordings and the good fast focusing.  I know a $600 camera would probably work better, but for $120 and with the portability of the recordings this is pretty much all I need.""

"20110723","1.0","Good for about a week","On the plus side- When it was working it worked fine.  Took it to Great Wolf Lodge and used it in the water with no problems.  Got some cool footage.  It was a bit grainy indoors, but outside was great.Negative- After about a week of use I was editing some of the video on the camera and it froze up and shut down.  Restart and videos were out of order.  Then it started saying there were no video's on there, then something about wrong or unknown format.  Took out SD card, put back in and video's were there... until I started recording again and same thing happened.  After a couple more times it seemed to be working again.  Then it just froze up while I was taking video.  Would not respond to pressing any of the buttons.  Stayed on for about 20 minutes until I reset it.  Did the same thing again, and so I reset again.  Then it had several rows of ? on a black background.  This one is going back.  I have used a flip for a couple years with no problems... back to the Flipcam for me.""

Sometimes it was clear and then for no reason it would be blurred for awhile. Also the the microphone was really susceptable to wind or any kind of movement making it really annoying to listen to. It is not a low light camera at all as most of Kodak camera's are not low light camera's. I returned it because I couldn't get the clear pictures I wanted.""

Was surprised when it 'went missing' in the two foot surf in Kaneohe, Hi, as I was boogie boarding with grand sons.  Luckily, recognized it immediately and greater luck -- was able to find it with my feet.  Used a tie wrap from a bread wrapper to tighten lanyard rest of day.  Now using a 1/4' length of small tubing to snub it down.  For our vacation use, really miss a flash and the screen still leaves much to be desired.

"20110722","4.0","PlaySport Zx5","The Kodak PlaySport Zx5 arrived quick and neat using my Amazon Prime shipping.  Right out of the box this thing rocks.  No delays while it boots up means you won't miss a shot.  This thing is ready to go in seconds.Simple and intuitive is the best way to describe the on board menu's and functions.  Within a minute I had gone and set the date and time, set the resolution, found the underwater compensation, etc..etc.  Then it was on to taking some movies.the good.. The Zx5 takes great movies no matter what you're doing.  Sports, kids recital, whatever..you'll love this camera.  Its built like a tank.  Its shock and water proof so I have no worries with my 5 year old using it.  Go ahead and drop it...it'll be fine.  Get it wet?  No worries..the bad..the ccd array is on the small side which limits the Zx5's ability to capture images in low light.  So my review of the image quality goes from fantastic in good lighting to just ok in poor lighting.  I expected that before I bought the camera so it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  Like any video editing software having a lot of computing power is a plus.  This is no exception.  The included software ran like a snail on my wife's net book but fine on my more powerful laptop.  This shouldn't be a surprise as the system requirements are clearly stated in the product information.  Just do your homework and read them before you buy.would I recommend it?...if you have high demands for a $120 digital mini camera (camera nerd) then no I wouldn't.  If you believe that you get what you pay for then yes, I would recommend the Zx5 because to me its a great little video camera that is tuff as nails and has great image quality...you just have to turn on the lights..""

"20110715","5.0","Great for our beach vacation","I ordered this camera for our summer beach trip. I immediately uploaded the firmware ugrade when I received the camera to avoid the video lockup problem mentioned in other reviews. I've had no issues with lockups or problems with memory cards. The port/battery covers stayed locked tightly in place in the sand and surf and the camera suffered no ill effects from ocean water. The water wasn't clear enough for good underwater videos, but the still pictures and other video that I took turned out great. The camera is sturdy and easy to operate. Even though it supposedly has an adjustment for glare on the LCD screen, it was still difficult to see what I was shooting when outside in bright light - a problem with almost any device that has an LCD screen. Other than that one small annoyance, it has been a great little video camera at an excellent price. I would highly recommend this camera for tossing in the bag for a trip outside. I'm not a professional photographer/videographer so this camera works great for me. I'm very happy with my purchase.""

The video quality is much better than what a cell phone could do (at least when comparing it to the iPhone 3GS). It is impact resistant and has a rubberized exterior so that you have a confident grip.The bundled Arcsoft video editor barely runs on my desktop (video card about 4 years old, 64-bit processor with almost 4 GB of RAM). The Kodak app which opens when you connect the camera is acceptable, not amazing. It has basic functionality and the tools that let you upload to social networking sites worked pretty well.

The very 1st time I used the camera it locked up. Also locked up in the middle of shooting a video. You should keep a paper clip w/ the camera to make sure you can reset it.Short battery life, you will run out of battery before a 16G SD card is full however I can live with this.Does not ship with a HDMI cable""
"20110711","1.0","Buyer be warned","Buyer be warned, this is one of the only water proof cameras that you can't actually get wet or use in the water. The two so called water tight doors are very flimsy and use cheap plastic slider latches that are impossible to open. Camera freezes often which requires carrying around a small pointy implement to hit the tiny reset button. The camera does easily switch from camera to video mode on dry land. If you will not be using this camera in the water the video and picture quality is good, just don't get the camera wet or let children play with it, it is not rugged at all despite Kodaks claims and it is not water tight or able to get wet.

I have spent three DAYS contacting online support (by the way, the online supervisors wouldn't give me their name when asked). Even talked to a Kodak rep (Anthony) who told us out-right that only so many coupons for the cables were available.(I MISSED OUT)  I am so PISSED!I also own a ZX3 Playsport (which did come with a HDMI cable at the same price I paid for the ZX5).Both cameras have their issues.  ZX3 is better in low light.  You can have more than one battery in hand because the sim cards can out last the battery.  MOV format in recording is a pain.ZX5 is easer to switch between 5mp camera to HD video and stabilizes the picture better.  No removable battery.  Low light recordings 'Bite'  Recording format is mpg4 I think.  It is easer to share though in media-Facebook and such.I am really angry with Kodak's support.Don't expect much from them if you have a problem.  I do own three of their cameras.

"20110707","4.0","Nifty, fun little camcorder","PROS: Takes surprisingly good videos when there's good light. Very easy to use, pretty much foolproof. The autofocus feature doesn't work all that well, but it's still an improvement over the fixed-focus lenses that are common in these pocket camcorders.CONS: I'm not impressed with 1080p videos from this model. While there is a small improvement in definition and detail compared to 720p videos, the overall quality of videos is better when using the default 720p resolution. Other reviews here have noted this too.OTHER: The main reason I bought this camcorder is its resistance to water and shock. It's perfect for kids, and underwater videos are fun and of better quality than I expected. But if you don't really need this.... we have a cheap little Samsung compact camera that takes equally good 720p videos, plus it has optical zoom and of course the still pics are way better than what you get from a camcorder.""
"20110706","4.0","It works underwater! at a great price","I received the Zx5 last week just before the July 4th weekend. We took some videos and still pictures in the town pool and then took it into the ocean in New Jersey. The videos are incredibly clear, even without the underwater setting. The camera is very intuitive, the control buttons are all easy to use and understand. I just charged overnight when I first received it and downloaded the latest firmware from the Kodak site before using it. I used a Transcend 16 GB Class 10 flash card and it has worked fine. The doors stuck a little after taking it in the ocean, but I rinsed it for a while in tap water and now they seem to open fine. The mini booklet that came with it suggests rinsing it in tap water after use in salt water so maybe that has something to do with the other complaints about sticking doors. I will update this post after I take it with me on a snorkeling trip to The Bahamas.""

This is a great way to get good information about a product before committing to a purchase.  In reading the reviews for the Kodak Zx5, I found some who loved it and some who were not so impressed.  I actually am smack dab in the middle.  The camera offers convenience and some decent quality.  It's super compact and VERY easy to use.  It has just what I want in a device I need to capture everyday memories, especially with the kids in the pool and when we go boating.  If you purchase this camera with greater expectations than these, then you proabably will be disappointed.  I have found so far that on the occasional video I will have very choppy video and delayed audio.  That really stinks if you have just caught a once in a lifetime event.  Fortunately, mine have been pretty ho hum, so no big deal.  The quality of the video is ok, the iPhone 4 does better. As is the case with most plug n play devices, the software loads from the unit or website with little control from the user. Bottom line for this Amazoner is that this is a $150 video camera.

The underwater correction filter is a dream for  quality.  I took it to 10 feet in salt water and no leaks.  Its registered up to 10.- Went to a construction site and tested the dust proof.  It works as stated.  No dust anywhere inside!- The class 10 32GB memory card I have works just fine.- Low light leaves a little to be desired.  Its grainy.

"20110529","4.0","Waterproof, Shock Resistant, Good Video","ZX5 ReviewCompeting Cameras:Sony BloggieJVC GC-WP10The first thing I want to mention is that this HD camcorder sells for $130.00, so don't expect to get the same level of performance as a more expensive (larger) HD camcorder. I rated its review based on the value you get for $130.00. Secondly, neither the Kodak ZX5 nor its competitors will give you everything you are looking for in a pocket camcorder. They all have pro's and con's, and you will have to make a purchase decision based on your needs and/or application. I purchased this camcorder to use this summer at the pool, and to take on hiking and camping trips. I also wanted a camcorder that my 11 year old could use, where if they broke it, I would not be out that much. The camera is very simple to use, taking only a couple of minutes to read through the manual. The ZX5 is very portable, about the size of an IPhone, which makes it ideal for my application. One thing you'll want to do once you buy the camera is to download the firmware update and install it from Kodak's website. The update improves color performance and fixes an issue of the camera locking up when using certain memory cards. I took me about 2 minutes to download and install the update...no big deal. Color looks good and the camera has nver locked up on me to date.Video Settings: The camera comes with a variety of video settings, including 1080 and 720. I prefer to shoot at 720, 60 frames per second. If you want to apply a slow motion video effect, it will look better when applied to video shot at 60 fps.4x Digital Zoom: The camera comes with a 4x digital zoom. Optical zoom is much better, but you are not going to get that on a pocket camcorder. The digital zoom allows you to zoom in on a subject, but the picture is not 'crisp'. Most of the pocket camcorders have a fixed focal length, so the 4X feature is a plus to some extent.DIS: The camera comes with Digital Image Stabilization, which is supposed to be better that Electronic mage Stabilization (EIS). In any event, I thought the camera did a decent job stabilizing slight hand movements.Mic: The mic is located on the front of the camera, and does a pretty good job in picking up normal dialog up to 7' away. You can also adjust the gain through the menu. The camera does not come with wind noise reduction, which may be an issue in windy conditions. Again, wind noise reduction typically is only found on more expensive cameras.Low Light Performance: Most low cost cameras (under $200)will struggle in low light conditions. All of the pocket camera are designed to shoot outside on nice days. When used indoors, the ZX5 picture looked a little grainy. You'll typically see this type of performance on all pocket camcorders.LCD: Some of the competitors have a larger screen (i.e. Sony), but the Kodak LCD screen is big enough to do the job. It is a little dark when used in bright daylight, but you can still clearly see what you are shooting. The resolution was o.k., but nothing to brag about.Storage: The camera does not have internal storage, but requires an SD card. I don't consider this a drawback, since most cameras rely on external storage cards anyways.Does not include HDMI Cable: The camera comes with a cable to connect it to your PC, but does not include an HDMI cable which kinda stinks. You'll have to get one from Kodak or Amazon.Available Options: The other nice thing about this camera is the variety of options that are available like a wide-angle magnetic lens, carrying cases, LCD protector, silicon cover, and many more...all available on amazon.Other Features: The camera comes with a tri-pod mount on the bottom, which is nice. It also has an external mic port.Conclusion: The big selling factors for this camera are that the camera is waterproof to ten feet, and is shock resistant. I read where the camera was drop tested at 5 feet and survived. If you want a camera that shoots decent video and audio, and can be used in a variety of dynamic environments, you definitely want to consider this camera. The video and audio quality is decent, and for the money, it is a good value.""

This is most definitely a very capable little camera.""
"20110519","2.0","Much better options available for sports action video","The design of the Kodak PlaySport is just simply not conducive to sports video.  The mounting screw is on the bottom of the long end of the camera so when it's mounted the camera shakes and wobbles so much the video recording is useless.  The other issue with this design is that the stress caused by the camera being mounted long ways literally snaps the Kodak mounting hardware in half.  I used the surfboard mount on a kitesurfing board and was only able to ride about five minutes before the mount snapped in half and left the camera dragging under water.  Luckily for me I attached the camera to another spot on the board with a leash.  Otherwise the camera would have been swimming with the fishes.  Of course the mount itself shares part of the blame for not being sturdy enough, but the camera design is what caused the issue in the first place.  Bottom line - the mounting screw should be on the side instead of the bottom.Also, the camera only seems to work properly if you take short video clips.  I used a Kingston 32GB card and tried to record a long kitesurfing session but after about 15 minutes of recording the camera locks up and is completely useless.  You can't even turn it off and start over when it locks up.  You have to wait until the battery dies.  I tried this no less than three times and the same thing happened each time.  Start recording, camera locks, let it die, and then nothing remains on the video card = useless.  However, I can then get the camera back into operating condition after a recharge and take a quick 5 minute video clip with no problem at all.For these quick little clips, the video quality is decent when taking video outside in bright sunlight, but it's horrible under normal indoor lighting conditions.  And don't even think about using this as a camera!  The photos taken with this camera are grainy and the color saturation is awful.Bottom line - save your money.""
"20110517","1.0","Locks up ....junk","The first gen was great, this one has been nothing but problems. Locks up and can't power down or press any buttons... all frozen. Since battery is internal you have to wait six hours for battery to go dead and then wait for it to recharge and hope it doesn't lock up. I ruined a three day trip of family memories because of thisnew improved over priced piece of junk, Called Kodak and they said they are aware of the issue and trying to fix it. Well I bought this April 20th, should have been fixed by now.""
"20110517","1.0","Nice camera if it would not freeze all the time.","I ordered one of these and it locked up constantly with the 32gig Transend memory that Amazon also recommended with it. I called Kodak support and they said it was the class 10 32gig Transcend memory that was causing the issues, so I purchased a 16 gig sandisk that was the same price as the 32gig transcend hoping the issues would go away, But the Zx5 locked up just as often with the new flash memory. so I returned it hoping it was a bad unit, the new Zx5 they sent me also locked up just as often, So I returned it for a refund and got the Zx3 instead, the battery does not last as long, but can be swapped out, the video on the Zx3 is .mov instead of .mp4 and the compression must not be as good cause the files on the Zx3 are bigger, and the Zx5's video looked better to me, but the Zx3 does not lock up at all. so I wanted to keep the Zx5 but it was just not ready for prime time. Myabe they will fix the issue and then I will wish I had the Zx5, but I wont buy something I cant use at all day one.Even though Amazon paid shipping on the return of the Zx5 I had to pay for the 16gig memory return, which kinda sucked, seeing it was not my fault his camera locked up and I just wanted to try other flash, and when that did not work I of corse wanted to return it also.""
"20110517","1.0","Doesn't work, ruins your videos","I read all the reviews on this device and decided to go for it, worst decision ever. The 2nd day of using it the device froze while playing back a video. The only way to turn the device off and unfreeze it is to hit the reset button located under the HDMI door. I was in the ocean at the time so I had to wait until I got back on the beach and then dried the device as not to get water in it.The 2nd time I was recording some video of me snorkeling. Was getting great shots of all the fish, at 4min 18sec the device froze. When I got back to shore I dried it off and hit the reset button. Scrolled to the video and it said 'unsupported file format'. When I put the SD card in my computer the video was deleted.Sometimes the sound cuts in and out or only picks up the people that are really close to the device.The only good thing I can say about the device is the picture quality is great. I already set up a return with Amazon on this POS.""
"20110516","1.0","Disappointed","The camera video quality is reasonable and the audio is just okay. I liked the idea of being able to video the kids in the pool and not worry about it getting wet. Unfortunately the camera would freeze up about 35% of the time. Typically this would occur after 2-3 minutes of filming and it would not only stop recording but I could not even turn it off, forcing me to find a paperclip to push the reset button. Further, it would fail to record the video I was shooting prior to freezing, causing me to lose precious moments. I tried multiple new high quality memory cards and it would freeze regardless. I also performed a firmware update and this just seemed to make the problem worse. I noticed from other reviews and on various blogs that there are many other people having the same problem. I contacted Kodak to find out if they are going to have a solution to the problem and was informed that there is currently nothing in the works. I informed them I would be sending it back and I am.""
"20110512","5.0","For the price, its an awesome camera!","I got this camera recently and Ive done alot of messing around with it, I LOVE it! I love the look, the feel, and everything else about it. It has so many different settings, and I absolutley love to change the settings for different things. My favorite effect to use is the High Saturation.Ive tested out all the different video quality and I like to record in 720p. 1080 takes up too much space, and for just screwing around and short videos, you dont need the BEST quality. I have a regular camcorder for that. I mainly got this for blogging this summer, band will be doing lots of traveling and Im using it for quick shots of just messing around.I dont know if the camera was completley dead when I got it, but it wouldnt turn on, so it was on the charger for about 2hrs and it was fully charged! Ive been messing with it on and off for about 5hrs now and it hasnt failed me yet.When I first put in my SD card (Transend 16GB) the video screen had lines going threw it and then it froze and wouldnt turn off, I pressed the reset button and took the card out, put it back in (with the camera off) and it works great!Im too scared to try it in water just yet, but soon!""
"20110512","4.0","Better than thought","I got this a few days ago and have played with it a lot. I have a 2yr old grandson, so I have a lot to film.. :-)  After reading some reviews I was not sure if I should get this, but I have had a lot of good experiences with Kokak, point and shoot and the Zi8, I decieded to give it a go and I am glad I did.  I think some people are being overly critical of the device in regards to quality of the HD.  Some others I think just have got a bad unit and they should just return it and try it again (the ones with freezing and screen issues.)  Now, if it does crap out on me in a few weeks, that's another issue, but I am going to remain positive and just base this review on honest expectations and experience.I have owned a number of camera's including a Panasonic DVX100 prosumer camera that I use for short films.  So quality is important to me.  That said, the video quality for the camera is quite good for what it is.  And what it is, is a small, point and shoot HD cameara with a small sensor.  So outside shots are going to look great, indoor, depending on lighting, you are going to get artifacts.  To expect anything any different from this level of camera is foolish.  If you want low level light without grain then spend a couple of grand at least...it's all about the sensor size when it comes to low light, any of these small camera's are going to have issues, use the grain to your advantage, get creative and have fun or shell out bucks.Also on the video quality I have noticed that the type of monitor matters as well and your viewing distance.  If you get up close and on some monitors it does look a bit grainy even in good lighting, but if you use HDMI and a good tv and view it at a 'normal' viewing distance the video looks very good, better than I thought it would actually.I have had no issues with audio/video syncing and I have shot in every way I can 720, 720-60 and 1080, no issues with playback but I have a pretty powerful PC, editing the 1080 video is a pain, I have to convert it first but that is to be expected, editing HD, and I mean truely editing it, not just cuting it, takes up a lot of CPU power and you need a really good PC or Mac for that.  But I bought this camera to take quick clips and upload them to youtube and my website, not make a movie with it.As a portable camea, I love it, it fits right in my pocket, it's rugged, so I don't mind my grandson playing with it and it shots good video that is easy to upload and share.  To me, it's totaly worth the money.  I will get a really good HD camera and spend some bucks to do so for more 'serious' things and video's but for just the everyday things, hiking, going to amusment parks, going to the park, vacations on the beach, etc, you can't beat this camera.One last thing the auto focus on this device is very good, and I do mean very good, most of these small cameras including the point and shoot digitals that also shoot HD video have major issues with the focus.  Every point an shoot I have had that shoots HD video that has had auto focus doesn't do it well at all or it has a fixed focus and with a little one you end up with a lot of blurry video's.  But this one has handled it all in stride, that alone almost makes it worth getting it.""
"20110512","3.0","Good Camera for the Money","So let's start with the obvious, this isn't a pricy camera, it is a relatively inexpensive camera, and if you set your expectations accordingly you won't be too disappointed.  This camera really is easy to use, charge it up, and literally point and shoot.  The file format is mp4 which works well for YouTube, so you can easily share your video.  I really liked the way you could stick this camera on a tripod.  If you are taking a video of an event, do your viewers a favor, use a tripod.  Anyone can operate this camera its easy.While this doesn't shoot with picture clarity in all levels of light that we may want, it works well.  If you are in well lighted situations, your pictures will be fine.  If you want to shoot in low light, it is going to be grainy.  I think this camera would be great to shoot vacation pictures, fun impromptu videos.  I wouldn't record my child's recital or something extremely important with this camera, as lighting becomes an issue.This offers more flexibility than most camera phones, and since the Flip is being discontinued, this may be a great option.  The camera says it water resistant but I wasn't brave enough to dunk it underwater, but it is great to know I could take this camera poolside without a lot of worries.  Set your expectations with the price point, the camera is a good value for its capabilities.""

"20110511","3.0","Good Camers for the Price, Could use some improvement","***I am a new user(no media expert here) and this simply reflects my experience so far***I enjoy using the camera outdoors and indoors when in 'good light' conditions.My only complain is that it does not do a good job in moderate/low light or shady areas.Indoors in moderate light you have to move around until you get a decent picture and when you get to a low light condition forget about it, don't waste you time recording. I also recorded some friends under a patio on a sunny day and most of it was dark and shadowy.Since it did so poor in low light I have not even tried recording at night.If they were to address the low light issue then it would be a great little camera.""
"20110510","1.0","a disappointment","I looked forward to getting and using this camera. I charged it up for 5 hours and then set it up. A few hours later I turned it on to find a grainy screen and then it would not turn off. I reset it per the booklet and it turned on okay and I set it up again. Two days later it would not even turn on. I never got to take a picture nor a video. This camera apparently has problems and I returned it for fear that it would never work properly. Don't wast your money nor time on this camera.""
"20110509","3.0","Good in one situation, poor to horrible in every other","First off, I completely understand the level of product I was purchasing.  I know this isn't a professional camera, and isn't going to produce pictures like one.  Important factors for me in buying were mpeg encoding, water resistance, HD at 60 fps.  Unfortunately, this is a camera that does one thing well, and a lot of things poorly.The one thing this camera does well is take video at 30 fps in full light situations.  That is all.As a movie camera.  It worked well on all but one setting, the 720p at 60 fps.  I would say 1 out of 4 videos I shoot at this setting have serious problems.  For about 1 out of 4 videos, playback of the videos suffer from a weird choppy accelerated mode.  It is not my computer, or tv, as I have tested them on many devices.  This acceleration also throws off the audio sync.  Audio and video for one of these videos is at least 1-5 seconds off.I paired the camera with a brand name 32 gig SD memory card.  I thought maybe the card was causing the problems.  For the about 6 hours of video I shot,, maybe 50 videos so far, I did have one error that stated it could not record due to memory card write speed.  And yes, this may be the problem.  However, I have tested the read/write of the SD card on my PC with no problems, and have never had a problem with media keeping up with the source.  Its always been the source that's the problem, in my experience.  I believe this to be true with this camera as well.The movies in the other modes was smooth and went as it should.Picture quality.  Great in bright outdoor sun.  Falls off quickly at dusk, may as well be a webcam circa 2002 at night. Generally would not use it indoors unless the lighting is very good.  As other reviewers have said, low light the camera is just not very good.As a still camera.  Terrible.  If you are shooting in anything other than bright sunlight, your picture will probably be blurry.  If its even a little dark, the picture quality will also suffer big time.  And here's the kicker that really turned me against the camera... in full sunlight, the only situation the camera takes really good pictures, about half the time, when you push the button to take the picture the camera will take 1-6 seconds to auto adjust to the light levels and focus.  Its unbelievably annoying to 'take' a picture...then wait and wait not knowing when the camera is actually going to TAKE the picture.  There were a number of times I took a picture, and then just quit and put the thing away after waiting god knows how long for the camera to actually take the picture.Lastly, the waterproof quality.  I would say it worked well.  I didn't have any leaks.  However, we used this once in the ocean, salt water.  As recommended, we rinsed it immediately after getting out of the water.  However, it was too late.  The water got into the latch (as it is designed to, that part isn't waterproof).  But when the water evaporated, leaving the salt, it completely jammed up the latch mechanism that opens the door to the memory card.  I tried a number of ways to clean it and get the latch to work, the only way that worked was to literally take the door apart and clean it to get it to work.  Frustrating and annoying.Overall, if you want a cheap waterproof video camera for a vacation to a sunny place, this should work for you.  Stay away from 60 fps, if you bring it in salt water open the doors and rise out the latches immediately as well.  If you want good still pictures, bring a separate still camera with you.If it weren't for the price, I'd give this product 2 stars.""
"20110506","4.0","Good camcorder for the money","This is a good camcorder for the price.  It doesn't take great video in low light.  Does take good video in daylight.  Takes decent pictures.""
"20110506","3.0","Many good points but not a good investment","The Kodak PlaySport video camera had many great qualities and I looked forward to trying it out. Here are my observations:Pros:-The video camera is compact and very sturdy. (It was dropped numerous times.)-It was easy to mount on my tripod and table top tripod.-It had a very simple menu and was so easy to use even my 5 year old managed it with no direction from us.-The video/audio quality was okay...about what you'd expect from a tiny handheld device.Cons:-In order to use it, you have to purchase an SD card. There was no internal memory at all. A 16 GB card works well if you're doing an 1 1/2 hours of filming or less before downloading.-You do have to install software in order for it to work on your computer.-The set up is a little complicated if you want to automatically email files once you connect to your computer.-In order to connect the camera to your computer you have to use a cord. (After using a Flip Mino HD with a built in USB connector, this was annoying.)All in all, it is a great camera with excellent durability. However, I am not sold on it because my iPhone has a video camera now (with about the same quality video/audio) and our Flip is more convenient to plug in. I think Kodak is off to a great start and maybe with future models, they can incorporate internal memory (like the Flip Mino) and the easy of the Flip's USB connector.""

"20110504","5.0","Great little camera/video camera!","I bought my ZX5 about a month ago and I really love it.  I have been reading peoples comments and wondering if there expectations were too high for a $150 video camera.  For the price, it takes nice pictures and excellent video.  This past weekend, I used it to tape some of my sons soccer and baseball games.  It was quite windy outside, so there was some extraneous noise due to wind hitting the speaker but the video itself was incredible.  I also videotaped my daughters Kindergarten concert (which was indoors) and both the sound and video were exceptional.  I have been using 720p(60 fps) most of the time but I have even tried to lowest setting (480p?) and have been impressed with the video quality as well (I like the 480p setting because it easily loads onto my iPad where I can watch/share my videos).  We have a boat and I am excited to capture the memories with my family using the PlaySport ZX5 and not having to worry about the camera and water damage.  If your looking for a rugged, small/portable, well-build video camera then don't hesitate...the ZX5 is a great camera.""
"20110502","2.0","Terrible Video Quality","One of the reasons I bought this little pocket video camcorder was to take some videos in the outdoors while doing sports. I wanted a video camera that I could drop, get wet and dirty and at the same time be able to take high quality HD video. In all is a well built and rugged design but the problem with this pocket camera is the VIDEO QUALITY. I have seen better results from an iPhone camera and I have also seen better results from a Veho Muvi HD pro Micro camera in low light conditions. The video quality is TERRIBLE, too granny even in high lighting conditions which make the camera a waste of money. In low light conditions the video was showing white and black pix elations dots. Simply not acceptable at all.In all you could buy a GoPro HD HERO 960 for a little more and have a camera with better specs regarding water, shock and dirt resistance and with a superb HD video quality.I returned this camera to Amazon and I will be buying the GoPro HD HERO 960 for almost the same price.The retail price of the GoPro HD HERO 960 is of $179 don't buy it for more. There are some retailers here in Amazon selling the GoPro HD HERO 960 for $259 which is the retail price of the full 1080p GoPro HD HERO camera so be careful. If you have the money to buy the full 1080p GoPro HD HERO go for it you won't regret it.Check out the Youtube video;HD Hero SHOOTOUT: Canon XH-A1 HDV vs. GoPro HD HERO""

I like the fact that you can use an SD card with this camera giving you many storage options. The only knock I have against this is the still image capture, it's good but not great.

"20110502","1.0","Kodak isnt addressing engineering defects - too many issues","I posted this review about the ZX3I have to assume that this product will have as many issues. I am now sticking with products from proven manufactures like Nikon and Canon. Kodak should be out of business soon with the way they have such high rates of products that just stop working and then treat customers the way they do.Its too bad that you can still get a 4 star overall score when you have so many people with products that stopped working. Unlucky for me, mine stopped working about 2 weeks after the warranty.I communicated with the live help and the basically told me that they were aware of the various manufacturing defects and that their engineers were building fixes for the NEW version of the product but unwilling to help the original customers. They wanted me to pay about 80% of the cost of a new product to fix it. Or I could get 15% of a new product which is something I could find on any affiliate site.Thanks for nothing Kodak. I was very hesitant on buying such an old school brand last year and I should have stuck with my gut. $179 down the drain.Looks like something like a 5:1 great to bad reviews. So maybe you have a 20% chance or so of your product becoming useless.""

"20110427","4.0","Better than a flip, but best if you'll actually use the dirty/ wet capabilities","This camera is extremely fun for what it is - a simple video camera for taking small amounts of video in outdoor conditions. While the video quality is very good indeed for outdoor use in light conditions, in the dark the image gets grainy fast.What it does well:Easy to use right away.Can take still images easily.Has a slot for an SD card for memory (and it needs it, since it was able to take a whopping 7 seconds of video without it).Great image stabilization features - you can actually walk and get reasonably steady video, unlike the flip which gets nauseatingly shaky.Great that I can record video in the rain, in muddy conditions, and even drop the camera while I'm running around.Looks sleek, fits into my pocket (unlike the Flip)What I wish it did better:I'd like an audio input jack so I can wear a wireless microphone.Sometimes I don't want a widescreen video. I'd like a couple more options in terms of the shape of the video taken.Some included memory in the camera would be nice! It advertises that it's 'ready to go', but it's not, unless you have an SD card already. I did, but not with me on my first time using the camera, so it was an unhappy surprise.Better video editing software - I don't want to do much - I just want to trim off the first and last few seconds of my videos. Their software crashed my system three times before I gave up accomplishing anything with it. Couldn't even get started with it, and my computer's only a year old and runs other video-editing software and my CAD program with ease.Overall, if you're actually an outdoorsy person and want a tough point and shoot, then this is a great camera. You'll be shooting some great video in a few minutes. If you don't need that rough-and-tumble capability, then go for the Kodak Zi8 instead. It has more features (like the audio input jack) that you'll be happy to be able to grow into.""
"20110425","4.0","If your going to record video outdoors, at the beach, or anywhere else there's water, the Kodak Playsport Zx5 is a top choice.","I might have given this digital camera five stars if the battery was removable.  Otherwise, awesome camera; With this Playsport, the company has fortified the camcorder's housing so it can withstand drops up to 5 feet, and it's as waterproof as ever, with the ability to shoot up to 10-feet deep. Video quality is also improved, and now competes more closely with non-rugged pocket videocamera competitors. A few things are missing, like a headphone jack, integrated storage, or a built-in USB connector, but if you want to record video outdoors, at the beach, or anywhere else there's water, the Kodak Playsport Zx5 is a top choice.Love the autofocus capabilty, Love that it's water proof, dustproof, drop-proof, expandable storage and very easy to work with.  I like the media sharing capablities but I really don't have a need for that.  The thing I don't like is the battery is not removable so you MUST keep the battery charged which is almost a deal breaker for me.  Interanl stoarge is only 128 mb of ram so at this price point, I think it should have came with more.  Overall this is an excellent camera.  Very well made, it can take some bumps, drops, spills and it shoots underwater. Thrilled with video quality, easy to hookup to your computer (PC & MAC).  If your looking for a camera that can shoot outside, underwater and have great video quality...look no further, this is your camera!""
"20110425","1.0","Very Unreliable Don't Buy","I actually like this video cam for what it does, takes decent non-professional video and is easy to use. But it is so unreliable that I can't imagine why Kodak keeps selling a camera with such serious defects.I just finished returning my second Zx5 to Amazon. Each returned camera had the same engineering defect, and the second camera froze during a video sequence and would not take pics, vids or even power down. The first defect is poorly engineered door latches. After several weeks it was almost impossible to open and close the door latches on either side of the cam. Since I download videos every day, the ability to access the USB and memory card ports is critical. I had to literally break into the first camera in order to retrieve my memory card before I sent it back to Amazon for an exchange. I had to do the same thing with the second camera before I threw in the towel and returned it for a refund. I have no idea why the second cam malfunctioned by not shutting down.I suppose the best thing I can say about both cameras is that it failed within the 30-day Amazon return window. So far Amazon has been great about the returns. They had a camera in the mail the same day I exchanged the first one online, and I received it the next day! Before they refund my money for the second cam I'm sure they'll want to have it at their facility first. No problem, Amazon pays for shipping both ways.I would like to own this camera. It does what I need it to do better than any other inexpensive waterproof 'snapshot' camera out there. But the camera's unreliability just doesn't cut it. Too bad.""

Tuck it in your purse and you'll always have it handy for little league games, school plays and impromptu 'too cute' moments that you want to capture to remember later. The buttons are easy enough for a child to use and the construction is solid enough that you won't worry about the camera being easily broken. I tend to feel more comfortable handing this camera to my teen to use than giving him my iPhone, which is my other 'on the go' video option. My only wish is that it had a better zoom range and that it worked better in indoor lighting. But for a simple, day to day camera to always have on hand, the PlaySport is a great solution.""
"20110419","4.0","Review from a Professional","Limited time and knowing the only way I could really test some of these functions would be in the shower or bathtub (that is an ugly image) I loaned this to a guy I know who shoots video all over the world for a living.  Here is his review word for word:The Kodak... makes good still and video images and the built-inmicrophone is adequate for close to camera sound capture. It'sintuitive user menu, automatic camera settings, and the simplicity ofdownloading images make the camera easy to use.The still camera works fine in bright daylight but is slow in lower lightsituations and can be problematic when it comes to camera or subjectmotion. Images tend to blur if you are not holding the camera perfectlystill. The lens itself has a nice wide field of view that makes forgood picture composition.As for the underwater capabilities of the camera, I can only recommendusing the camera in freshwater at or just below surface level. It seemsto me to be really more of a good splash camera. I tested the camera ina saltwater fish tank and it performed well. Then I tested it in thespray coming off the bow of a speedboat, and the camera failed. Thecamera failed to turn off and none of the function buttons wouldoperate. The good thing was that after leaving it to dry for a numberof hours and charging the battery back up the camera seemed to workjust fine.I would recommend this camera for the price point and ease of use but Iwould be concerned about it's performance for anything more than veryshallow underwater use in a swimming pool or as a splash camera.From the NON-Professional: As the owner of the camera, I am impressed by the size and weight, as well as the easy to figure out functionality.  I think for under 200, this is a great value.  I like simple, this is simple.""
"20110418","5.0","Excellent, amazing, better than the FLIP","The Kodak Playsport is kind of an upgrade when compared with the FLIP and the FLIP is pretty great, to begin with. It operates on the same principle as the FLIP - small, handheld, one-button operation and a high-quality film product. But there are a few big differences between the two. First, the Kodak is waterproof up to 10 feet which makes it a great vacation camera particularly if you're going to a tropical location and plan to snorkel. The shape of the Kodak is slightly thinner than the FLIP and contoured to feel good in your hand, especially if you have to hold it for any length of time. The best part of this camera is the fx function where you can change settings to film in high saturation, 70s grainy, black and white, or sepia (I've used all of them but the high saturation is pretty great). The Kodak also takes still images. Another benefit of this camera over the FLIP is the ability to upload to social media platforms and the quality remains high (there are options regarding image size that you don't get on the FLIP). One other nice addition is this camera comes with a USB wall recharger and the charging time is cut down drastically from charging on a computer per the FLIP (although you can buy a separate wall recharger for the FLIP).The only downside to the Kodak is you need to buy an SD card for it and it gets pretty expensive when you factor in the cost of the camera and the SD card (around $49 for a 16 GB card).Since the future of the FLIP is somewhat in question these days, I'd go for the Kodak. It screams fun. And the result is great. Love it!""
"20110417","2.0","So far...not so good","Just got the ZX5 yesterday at a local store while waiting for the ZX3 to arrive in the mail. I figured I better conduct a hands on comparison so I have no buyers remorse or regrets. Today we went to a piano concert and I was a bit disappointed to say the least. Simply very grainy and much lower quality video than I was expecting.  I experimented with several modes of play 720P, 720P@60fps, 1080P.My hands are as steady as a rock. I have a SanDisk Extreme 16 GB Class 6 SDHC card, so the card is superior to the minimum Class 4 Kodak recommends for this device.  And the bad thing is, the room we were in at this piano concert had high towering windows so the lighting was more than abundant. This room was not real big as it only seats about 200 people. The piano was about 35-40 feet away from where I was sitting. I set it at no zoom for the first piece played,then 25% zoom for next and so forth just to experiment. Upon coming home and viewing the videos, they were all pretty much unacceptable. I certainly am not expecting it to perform like a 300.00+ device but my videos are not even close to the YouTube video reviews...period! If I wanted to spend that, I would definitely go with the 'Go Pro' which is incredible. But that is not in the same league as what we are reviewing here...apples and oranges.Outdoors was the same; also grainy in these same modes. Huh! I'm bummed! I'm expecting the ZX3 in the mail between now and Wednesday.  I will put up another review when I get that one to compare.I was hoping the lower star reviews I've been reading about this ZX5 were simply people expecting too much as I really wanted this model to be the one.  Unfortunately for me, not the case.  We'll see what happens with the ZX3 when I receive it.  Hopefully that will perform much better so I can stop the search and extensive research reading reviews.  I will be extremely disappointed if I have to return both of them.  Time will tell.""
"20110415","3.0","Has Issues with Class 10 SD Cards","The camera itself is quite nice, it looks good and the video quality is good considering the price point of the device (remember it is not a $500+ handycam).My main problem is that the device has issues with Class 10 SD cards. I bought two Class 10 16GB cards (different brands) to use with the Zx5 and both have trouble being read. I have to take the card out and reinsert it and it usually works about once every 4 goes. The cards work fine in every other device I have.Kodak support advised that they have not tested it with Class 10 cards and there may be issues because it is a new type of card.""
"20110415","3.0","A good compact camcorder and waterproof but...","I like this compact camcorder:- cool design (even though there are more colors available in Europe!)- compact (fits in a pocket) and light- easy to set up and use- good image quality (not outstanding, especially in low light conditions, but it does the job; if you want a very good one, then pay for it)- dustproof, shockproof: no fear either to let the kids use it or to use it in dusty conditions (beach...)- waterproof... here comes the reason why I only gave it 3 stars: the SD slot and the plugs are protected by rubber so no problem. But I used it while snorkeling and on a boat (sea sprays) and cannot dry it and rinse it with fresh water immediately; then the door seals were stucked on the close position and I had to force them to be able to open them again, and then couldn't close them anymore until I learnt a great trick to melt the salt: dip into white vinegar for at least a couple of minutes, rinse and dry! Kodak should improve the protection of the door seals (if I buy a waterproof camcorder, I want it to work not only in swimming pools or my bathtub!!)Overall, a good product for the price.""
"20110414","5.0","Love it!","Wanted a flip for years, never got round to it, and then, last week decided on the Kodak instead as it seemed like the better product (lucky we did, now that the flip's being discontinued). Anyway, we love it! Ease of use is great, it's really quick to start, the quality is great and you can also take pictures with it. It's small and handy. Haven't tried it in the water until now, so can't comment on that yet. But so far, I would definitely recommend it.""
"20110413","2.0","Disappointing","Nice form factor but video quality was very grainy and disappointing. 4th gen iPod Touch 720p HD quality is much better than what this Kodak camera provides. Nice build quality but video quality is a showstopper for me.""
"20110413","5.0","Handy to carry for any event","I'm not very technically intelligent, so I had reservations about this as a new toy, but I was pleasantly surprised.Easy to handle, easy to manipulate, this little video camera is sturdy and fits well in your hand; I use it to record guitar lessons, and both video and audio quality are good. Playback is easy as well; the zoom feature brings things very close-up; and the settings are not complicated. I'm having a lot of fun with this camera, and carry it with me everywhere. I will leave the technical aspects of why this camera is superior to others of its form to those who can explain them knowledgeably. I can only report that, for a techhie-illiterate such as myself, I had absolutely no problem working this, from the initial charge-up on the computer to video-recording to playback. And it is small enough to carry with you anywhere. Big thumbs up.""
"20110413","4.0","Great camera","I have read the other reviews, and agree, this camera does have some limitations, most notably, the permanent battery issue.  However, thus far, the camera has had good battery life, and we have had no issues with run time.  It charges quickly as well.However, I think some people have lost sight of what this really is, and how well it works.  It's a great hand held video camera, that you can literally drop in the family pool, swim down and get and it's still running very well.You have several options on the video modes such as underwater mode, and you can record in several different levels, 720P, 1080P, etc.I have found the overall functionality, sturdy constuction and ease of use to be outstanding.  I can see this being used all summer by the pool or even play time in the bath for those with little ones.Highly recommend this product!""
"20110411","1.0","Lens cracked within 3 days of owning it","I bought this product last week because I was going to the beach and wanted a waterproof camera. On the second day there I accidentally knocked it off the table and it landed on the floor. Although this camera claims to be shockproof up to 1.5 meters, it broke after falling only 3 feet. I'm sending the camera in to be serviced but accidental/water damage is not covered under the Kodak warranty (even on a shockproof/waterproof camera) so I cant wait to see what the bill is going to be! Other then that, the camera is just OK as long as you do not drop it.Hope this helps!""
"20110411","4.0","Judging Price vs. Performance, A Decent Kid/Camping-Proof Camera","To let you know where I am coming from on this review, I have two sons, 9 and 4. We do a lot of camping without mom, but want to share our adventures.  So far, our trips have destroyed a Canon Powershot 450 (overly hydrated while canoeing) and a Powershot 980IS (smashed into ground during a fall.)  So the idea of a waterproof, shockproof and hopefully kid-proof camera sounded perfect.Purpose for camera: Rugged camera to take along canoeing, fishing, camping, and hiking for snapshots and quick, shareable movies.I have never owned a camera in this class, and the one thing I am trying to keep in mind is the price point.  This is not intended to be a high-end performance device, but more a rugged snapshot camera.  I was a little suspect on 1080P on a hand held device under $175 (still am,) but the 5 MP camera is adequate for photos to email to grandparents and to show off our catches and camps to mom.Design -The camera is very nicely designed.  It is physically attractive and comfortable in the hand.  The winged doors lock into place well in their watertight positions and are, well kind of cool. The screen is adequate for playback and we spend a lot of time watching what we filmed over and over.  The controls are spare, but easy to understand and operate.  The four major flaws I found are; the embedded battery, lack of a flash, lack of lens cover, and no headphone jack for previewing sound.Battery-It is unfortunate that the design team decided to go with an internal non-removable battery.  This seems to move the device into the 'disposable' class since it is useless once the battery dies.  I suspect that the battery can be replaced fairly easily, judging by the hex screws in the camera body, but there is a big difference between slipping a battery in and out and sending the camera out for replacement.  Also, I can make a huge argument for being able to carry a back up battery.  At least for now though, the battery seems to have a decent charge.  We have filmed and played back films for at least two hours between recharges and have never seen the battery near empty.Performance -Image capture: 1080p is a lot to ask from such a small sensor. For that matter, so is 720p.  So I am satisfied with the images I am getting, not great but what I would expect.  I usually shoot Canon DSLR's (except when camping with kids) so I am at times frustrated by the lack of manual controls of any kind.  Autofocus, autoexposure... with no way to change anything beyond file format and resolution.  The images and video I am getting are a little noisy and especially so in low light. Blurring from camera or subject motion is common on stills. This is where the flash option would be nice.  But in daylight, or decently lit interior shots the images are definitely passable.  Again, judging this camera on its price point and function, it really is decent.  If I want good stills, I'll go with a Canon 50D, if I want a snapshot of my kid pulling a bass into the canoe, this is perfect.I am uploading a video with more details on picture and movie quality.Sound: For a single source mike on the camera, it does pretty good.  Definitely picks up footsteps or breathing, so don't film while walking up hill.  Truly emphasizes if you are out of shape.  Picks up ambient sound well and in tests in a light breeze, did fine.Interface:  I had the interface lock up on me once and I was unable to get it to power off or get out of a locked state.  I had to use the small reset button to get it to reboot and clear the freeze.  So I have thrown a very small paper clip in its case.  Without being able to pull the battery, the reset button seems to have been the only option.  Otherwise the device is very fast loading up, and the interface is intuitive and easy to use. Although occasionally when browsing I end up in fast forward or reverse when watching a movie and it takes a little to get it back to play or browse.Summary:All in all, I am really happy with this camera.  It is full of limitations which you should understand before purchase.  For the price, it is a decent camera and it fits our intended purpose to a Tee.  My kids love the ability to take a movie, then watch it immediately.  I like the feeling that it might survive the kids for a while.  I feel like I'm being pretty critical of the camera, and I guess I am.  But I'm giving it four stars because it does what I want it to, and after using it for a couple weeks, I really like it.  Just don't expect the world from a inexpensive camera.Pros-Price (under $175 is not a high end price)Images are decent (under daylight or bright light conditions)KidproofQuick to startupWell thought-out designJust all round cute and usefulCons (in order of importance to me)Internal Battery (cannot be replaced, nor can you carry a spare)No Flash (can't stop motion blur, fill flash)Low-light performance (weak performance, noisy video and stills)Complete lack of manual controlsOccasional lock-ups on interfaceNo Head phones for reviewing moviesWhen switching through modes it keeps defaulting to zoomed out""
"20110411","2.0","Not a standard video camera","I was so excited when I ordered this camera.  I hoped to catch all the memorable moments that we will have with a new baby.  It had all the specs I was looking for in a little package much like my cell phone.  But it's just not like a regular video camera.  The lens is so very limited in range. I could not get an entire body shot of my 1 year old son without standing a good distance away. This camera seems to be a lot like my cell phone camera and that's not what I thought I was purchasing. The screen is tiny...there's so much room for a larger screen or more buttons for easier navagation.  The buttons are difficult...you have to press it one time and wait for it to process your request before pressing again. I should have waited for consumer reviews before ordering. I returned the item because it is of no use to me. I already have a cell phone video camera. I will be looking for a standard hand held video camera. I hope this helps any new parents looking for a camera to make a decision on purchasing this item.""

"20110402","2.0","I had to sell it and buy the Zx3","Immediately after I received the camera, I noticed that the battery is now internal and thus can't have a spare battery when shooting outdoor.To be honest, that made me change my mind about the camera. I placed an ad on ebay and sold it the next day!I've used the Zx3 before, and in many cases, while am with my friends hanging out and shooting with the camera, I get a low battery notification. The good thing was that I always had a spare battery which will save me from missing the happy moments.That can't be the case with the Zx5.I believe that Kodak has done a very big mistake in this new model. Locking the battery and offering a macro feature in stead doesn't make the Zx5 any better. It's  like going from Zx5 to Zx2.""
"20110401","5.0","What is the zx5 like","i own the zx3. so when kodak said they where bringing out another waterproof camera with macro i couldnt wait to see what it was like.it is alot like all the other kodak camcorders. it records in the following:WVGA, 720p 30 and 60 FPS, 1080pit also has a 5 megapixel camera option on it.it has 4 extra colour effects which are good if the mood strikes.normal, High Saturation, 70's film, Black and white and Sepiait also has the glare shield which the zx3 has. the difference with the zx5 is it has a sensor which change's the screen automaticaly. i have tried it and it works very well.i found the low light to be better than the zx3. the 60fps low light was really good.it has an internal battery which some people dont like. i thought it would be a problem to but after having the zx5 for nearly a week i havent even noticed the internal battery.you can record 2 hours and 35 mins in 720p at 30fps. which is better than the zx3.you can edit the video on the camera its self and then press the share button to upload it on to facebook, youtube and other sites. you also have the arcsoft software that comes with the camera.the zx5 has water correction which i would ashume works the same as the H20 setting on the zx3. the underwater video is a lot better than the zx3. it is very clear and the autofocus works very well underwater.here is some underwater tests using both cameras:[..]some people have said about the zx5 having bad audio. i have had a lot of pocket HD camcorders and some of them had bad sound others have had really good sound. to me the sound is ok. i would admit that the zx3 has slightly better sound but to me the zx5's sound is ok.here is a sound test which was done. i dont think the sound is that bad.[..]kodak have said that the zx3 will be discountinued soon. which means that the zx5 will take its place. i think that the zx5 has a lot to offer. the zx3 has some huge shoes to fill but it also has had its issues to.the only issues i have found so far are that there is a background noise when using the camera underwater. also sometimes when you move the camera infront of the sun you get a bronze flash on the screen. some times the autofocus tries to focus behind you when there is nothing there. its not as bad as the sony bloggie cm5 but it is there.i do like the zx5 and i have really enjoyed using it. i dont find the sound an issue and having used the zx5 for nearly a week i havent had any problems with the internal battey.at the end of the day you have to make up your mind what you want and what camcorder fits those needs.here are some pros and cons for the zx3 and zx5:ZX3 Pros:Cheaper. better sound. removable battery.Cons:soon to be discontinued. zoom has problem. low light is grainy. some have green pixels in low light. low light not so good. records 1 hour and 20mins per chargeZX5 Pros:has macro. has auto focus. better underwater video capture. battery records 2 and a half hours per charge. zoom is better. video quality is better. has special colour effects. low light is better. its dust proof, water proof and shock proof.Cons:slight background noise when underwater. bronze flash sometimes on sunny days. autofocus can sometimes jump. which means it goes out of focus for a couple of seconds.so there you go. i really like my zx5 and i think i will be using it alot more than the old zx3. i hope this has helped.for more videos and reviews check out Chrisc74 on youtube.""

"20120503","1.0","ZX5 constantly freezes and KODAK support doesn't help in fixing the issue","I received my video camera, Playsport ZX5 for Christmas, it was just over month when I started having the freezing issues (which I wasn't able to return to Amazon and had to deal with Kodak directly). Kodak Tech Support is horrible, they do not respond in a timely manner, they constantly refer you to their site on how to 'reset' the camera. I know how to reset it, but I'd like to address the real issue of it constantly freezing up. I called in early Feb and after a reset 3 times, things seemed ok. Until I went on a family vacation again last month. The camera froze over ten times through out the week. I now carry a paperclip around with me, but that's not ideal. I've been trying all afternoon to get in touch with Kodak support, no luck yet.I would look around at all the options before purchasing this camera.""
"20120502","4.0","Does Everything I Need It To Do","I got the Kodak Playsport for Christmas, and I've been using it a ton. I know this doesn't really help, but the camcorder doesn't come with any memory. Remember to buy an sd for it. There's a slot on the side of it. You can change the resolution from Ipad compatible to 1080p. The picture quality is 5mp, so it's okay in that department. It's always fun to use this by making videos and taking pictures but the menu screen is really bad. It shows about 12 pictures at a time, and it's kind of slow while you're searching for the picture you want to view. Though, while you're watching videos, it looks as good as ever. I would like it a fair bit better if it had a bigger screen, but I don't mind that much. It has a share button, which I like because it's easy to use. You can also control the microphone. I mean, make it pick up more of what's happening around you. If you want to take a video for a skit, then the best idea is to turn the microphone down a little, so you can only hear what's closest to you. And so you don't have to deal with ol' Jimmy's snoring in the other room.Anyway, it's shockproof up to like four feet, which is healpfull because I AM going to drop stuff. Also, to help it's durability, there's a strap on the cam that you can't see on some of the pictures on this website. Though, you can't ajust it. Since my arms are kind of small, I just loop it around one of them. Then you can easily take a video of that roller coaster. This camcorder is pretty much MEANT for outside. Even though it doesn't have a flash, it's still pretty bright. I don't like the volume on this thing. It doesn't really have a setting between 'off' and 'high' so you can't watch quietly.Transfering my pictures and videos with the cam is a breeze. One of the more well known things about the Playsport is that it's waterproof up to ten feet. so it's fun to use while in the pool of playing in the sprinkler. You might notice that the sound is bad right after you put it in water, but there's a setting called 'underwater correction' which solves the problem. The design is basically this. On one side there's an sd card slot, and on the other side, there's a USB slot, and an HDMI slot. It comes with a USB and a cable to it that plugs into an outlet for charging. It can also can fit on a tripod.I love this camcorder and I'm happy that I bought it. I hope this review was helpfull.""
"20120428","5.0","kodak bankrupcy, get it now, love it","I just purchased the kodak PlaySport Aqua , and am loving it. Most reviews say the same thing, and some are negative, but don't believe them, this kodak product is great for cons, but pros too.  The 4 .5 stars should be 5, this product rocks. Kodak is going bankrupt so these cameras are cheap- spend the 100! You won't find a good high quality camera/ video/ waterproof this great for that price. It is perfect to take on a trip, and a perfect pocket camera. The effects rock- sepia, black and white, 70s, and high saturation .  The package said up to 5 hours to charge from dead battery, and it took me 45 minutes. No need for 1 day shipping, It came in 2 days, thanks UPS! The zoom is a great feature- i zoomed and can see the ingridients on a apple juice label!  Easy to use, and the only thing is that u MUST purchase a SD card. It will not give you enough internal memory, but you just need a 8-16 G. You can get them at Best Buy. I reccomend this product, kodak is going so get it cheap, it's worth it, seriously, don't look, it's great, just buy it and have fun.""

"20120420","1.0","POOR DESIGN","I cannot submit an opinion about the video quality because we never had a chance to view any of the footage taken. The access covers on either side of the camera, one for USB and one for the memory card, open very easily during normal use. If you use this camera underwater, as we did, (and that IS what it is designed for) you run a great risk of opening one of the access covers by simply sliding your hand or thumb up alongside the camera to reach the power button (located on top of the camera). The camera was ruined the very first day we used it. A total loss.""
"20120419","2.0","...but I thought that door was closed, sealed and locked???","I was looking for a small hands free video camera to record the numerous encounters that occur when taking a walk, riding my bike, riding the bus, being in public and shopping. Some people and stores get real persnickety when they are being recorded so I looked for pen and other 'spy' cameras but the reviews were really disappointing.The waterproof/shockproof Kodak PlaySport and the GE DVR1 looked like they might work either from a bicycle or from a shirt pocket with custom mounts. I picked the Kodak for its low light sensitivity and other features and because I did not need the face recognition software built into the GE and I did not like its fold out USB plug on because they eventually break from folding, ending the life of the camera.WARNING: In future models the USB power cable could be replaced with a power receiving coil and the USB signal function replaced with BlueTooth but in this model the waterproof door demands checking and removing even a microscopic speck of dust before closing and washing in fresh water and completely drying before opening. The extra warranties offered by Amazon on purchase are testimony to this HAZARD but neither Kodak or Amazon warn you BEFORE purchase about the the fact that water destruction depends upon the doors keeping the innards sealed since the door lock mechanism can be accidentally opend from normal handling of the camera. Oops!Aside from that I have yet to test picture quality and function for my particular use and will update this if anything is seriously wrong.UPDATE: It took awhile to get it to the beach to test its waterproofness and operation and beyond mounting on my bicycle and letting it run. Beyond that usage this camera turns out to be a piece of crap. (You will be highly disappointed in HD mode for video except perhaps for recording the pause of a snail or slug.)The 'waterproof' covers for the SD card, HD and USB connectors are made of pot metal and a few minutes in salt water is all it takes to nearly immobilize the hinge and latch. I see now why Kodak is unloading these cameras and getting out of the digital camera business once and for all. After soaking and rinsing in distilled water three or four times the cover hinge and latch still required application of oil.Just when you get use to this camera's funky configuration - buttons and setting changes, video selection, trash, review and sharing and start looking for the HDMI and AV cable in the box you find that only the ports were included. The cables have to be purchased at extra cost and the one that Kodak sends will connect to only a micro HDMI connector.The camera can not be used as a USB web cam either and there is also no timer, so forget time lapse shots too. Its a $25 camera with advertizing, hype ramped up to make it look like its worth $100.As for waterproofness I figure that it will not be long before the only way to get that is to put it in a freezer bag.""

"20110330","2.0","Video quality isnt good","I expected for the video quality to be good but its wasn't acceptable. I recorded in 1080p and viewed it on my HDTV and it was not HD. It was horrible. A cell phone camera can do better than this. The colors seem to be off at times too. Video can be choppy sometimes but seems to get better once you switch to 60 fps.The low light videos were grainy and is even more choppy.Photos are also not acceptable. Of course this is a camcorder first but if its gonna have a still photos feature it should at least take decent photos. My point and shoot camera not only takes much better photos it also shoots better video. I could say this about all the cameras that my family own.On the other hand, Build quality is really good. It feels great and very solid. I have not shot underwater or performed any tests but I'm sure this is a very rugged camera.Overall I wasn't happy with the camera and wouldn't recommend it to my friends.""
"20110330","1.0","1 star for software 4 for camera","Sigh, I loath having to knock something down to one star due to the bundled software but when you have a camera with a main selling point of one button video share then it should do just that and work out of the box. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get it to install at all and I tried.The camera itself is really nice and is about the size of today's cellphones so would probably fit into a cellphone belt case with ease. It comes with a wrist strap, a USB cable and a tiny power adapter which plugs into the USB cable should you wish to charge from an electrical outlet. Shooting a clip is as simple as pressing the top power-on button and hitting record. Now here's an important caveat - when you buy the camera it can hold 6 seconds of HD movies and about 12 pictures. Unlike the Flip Mono series there's no usable onboard memory so add an SDHC card of class 10 to your shopping cart when you buy. Of course you can't add any extra memory to the Flip Monos so having to buy an SDHC card is actually plus in a round about way. I purchased an 8GB card for about ten bucks and calculated it would hold 2 hours of HD video (I wasn't far off; it's two hours eight minutes according to the display). A good 32GB card would be useful if you're heading out on vacation. I shot some footage both above and below water and it looks great. I was very nervous about dropping the camera underwater for the first time as it just feels wrong! But it recorded fine and the LCD display was bright and viewable in the surf. You can select various HD resolutions all the way up to 1080p which is a nice space saving feature.All in all I was very happy with the ease of use, performance and video quality of the camera.So now I have some footage let's edit it and send it to youtube. This is where things went south. At first I tried to use the camera with my laptop which is only a couple of years old and is running XP SP3 and is fully up to date. After plugging the camera into the USB port several pop-ups informed me of a new device and eventually (after going through a lot of pop ups including disk drive, camera, CD rom drive, volume driver etc) the kodak software installation appeared. It wished to install two components and I click next. At that point it attempted to connect kodak's servers but constantly said the laptop was not connected to the internet. A quick trip to Firefox and outlook proved it wrong. Thinking it might be my firewall Zone Alarm, I simply shut it down but still no dice and nothing I tried resulted in the Kodak software connecting online. It did give me the option of just installing the edit software but I wouldn't have one click share so I proceeded with that. The fun adventure then continued with the software simply crashing out to desktop with an obscure error at which point I gave up on the laptop and went to my desktop PC. Again it's fairly new running XP. This time the software connected to the internet and downloaded what it needed. It then tried to install some C++ routines which failed with an error although it said success on the install panel and then my machine reset. No blue screen or warning just straight to boot up. Sweet. Annoyed I let it boot up and tried again at which point the software simply said my machine wasn't 'adequate' of running the Kodak software and it crashed with some obscure error.So I'm done. I've tried two completely different PCs with zero success. I have a Flip mono which works perfectly on both machines for what it's worth. I can take footage and indeed read the files on the camera but since they're in MP4 format most of my edit packages including Sony Vegas Video, Adobe Premiere etc won't read the files. I could convert them to a more edit-friendly format but I won't. I was told the camera was one-click share and for me it's not. I wasted two hours trouble shooting the software instead of shooting my footage and I feel I'm done. Shame really. Your mileage may vary.""
"20110330","5.0","A Five Star Piece of Kit","I received this nifty little video recorder the day before my nephew's birthday party, which was being held at a local motel with an indoor pool. The kids had a ball with this recorder and the only thing I did before I handed it over to a gaggle of screaming six year olds was to make sure the battery was charged and to put an SD card in the recorder. I didn't look at the directions and they certainly didn't.They played with it above and below the water and they got some outstanding videos and all I have to say is if six year olds can operate a recorder like this, figure everything out and use it the way it was intended in seconds and have the videos come out looking good, though admittedly they look like six year olds shot them, than this is certainly a five star piece of kit.""

"20110322","5.0","A Mil 810 camera for 179? and it shoots 1080P or 720P HD?","Ok, enough with the numbers already. There are really cheap (&lt;200 buck) cameras that will film 1080p and higher end cameras.  I compared this to the contourHD as they are the only two cameras I have in the price category.  The kodak suffers from low light - using their $6 micro hdmi to standard hdmi cable I was able to see on a large monitor the pixelation in dark areas.  The contour did not have this problem.  Other than that, filming on a sunny day they were equal.  People who expect a $200 camera to perform at the level of a $1500 camera are off center.  I own several professional video HD cams and these sub 200 buck units do not do justice to the video standard.As for the ruggedness, I do mil 810 testing for companies in my lab all the time - there are a large number of subcategories of Mil 810 (a,b,c,etc) that specify dropping the item (here they dropped onto plywood instead of concrete in their testing), thermal cycle profiles where you go from 0C to 50C, dwell at each end for a specified time, then ramp back to the other temperature - this tests the integrity of the plastics, seals, etc.  Water immersion test - does it leak? - there is (modeled after desert storm) a blowing sand test to see if the air filter in the genset/air intake on the engine can handle dust laden air and separate the dust.  All of these are components of Mil-810 but if you pass all of them, congradulations, the department of defense might just buy your product.  For us consumers on the other hand it means if we take it to the beach and it gets wet, we're not out a camera, and when we get home we can wash it off with water then download our images to our pc video system.  Mil 810 is thus a measure of construction quality and nothing more - it must be done under very controlled conditions (for instance I must plot the temperature and humidity on my ESD zap table for 1 week before conducting a test on a chart recorder - that chart then becomes part of the test results when I shock all metal surfaces with 5000V DC discharge to a grounded brass sheet on a wooden table 1 meter off the concrete floor - that's a mil810 ESD test to ensure static zaps dont kill the product.The picture - lets' get to the meat of it - now I have 4 HD cams lined up to compare - love them all -they all have a purpose.  But all purposes are not the same, which is why I have 4 cheap cameras.Cam #1 - I was an early adopter and bought the HF10 canon when it came out - the one with the 8mp image sensor and both optical and digital image stabilization - a fine 1080p camera on sdhc cards.Cam #2 - I bought the contourHD 1080P helmet cam because I was shooting the back seat of the (now shut down) san jose police helicopter as a ridealong - turned out to be a busy night because of a pursuit that happened, and I had good visability in the back seat since in a helo the pilot is on the right and the observer w/ flir is on the left.  We stuck the camera to the observer's helmet with the 'removable' adhesive from 3mCam #3 - The flipHD - nice concept compared to the contour to have a mini hdmi out, internal battery, easy to use, but 720p instead of 1080i (this is the 2nd gen minoHD brushed stainless)Cam #4 - this one Koadk PlaySport 1080p/720p combo, internal battery, like the flip but 1080 and more ruggedWith cams 1,2, and 4 I can do NLE on my adobe premiere system and keep 1080P. The advantage of keeping one resolution is simplicity in editing - you do not have to transcode 720p up to 1080p.  Provided you get a good sound sync (with a clapper time code display) on all 3 cameras at the same time, then leave them running, you can shoot 3 angles of a scene with 3 cameras, and when you get into adobe you can shift between the 3 views of the scene relatively painlessly to make a more interesting video.  You need the sound time sync (the clap of the chalk board) so that you can fine adjust each of the cameras into time sync which makes the transitions seamless if the color space doesn't change between cameras.I worked in the video division of Logitech for 3 years - we made alot of these products- - you'd never take your DSLR 15 MP camera to the beach, but you'd take your $99 logitech camera to the beach and if it got ruined it's a benjamin and not 25 of them!  That was the philosophy of design - make it at a price point that your children can play with it, it can get abuse, and still work.  We also conducted color space testing with gretag macbeth color charts on the new camera designs under different illuminants (outdoor, indoor, flourescent, halogen, w/wo ultraviolet and infrared, and  all our cameras had to pass the color consistency test.  You will want your cameras to expose a set of colors, such as the gretag color chip sheet (which you can make your own for free at the paint isle in the hardware store - get the saturated color chips and put them on an 11x17 piece of paper  - get reds/ greens/ blues and a few dark browns, greys, blacks, and you can make your own chart saving $200 from gretag!)using your chart adjust all your camcorders to expose color the same way and you are ready to do multi camera scenes in NLE - it helps to have a high speed computer with a graphics card like a GTX480 from Nvidia to process video quickly.Personally, I like Kodak's approach - contour HD started the social group with people putting their bike rides on the net in hd, but kodak took it a step further with the lcd display, the sand reistance, and the mil810 ruggedness.  It's a camera I feel yields a good quality picture and that I can trust for a 2nd angle - such as in the helicopter footage, I shot using the canon $1K camera and a dual 30Krpm gyro underneath it that, after spinning up for 5 minutes, would buffer out the chop of the chopper.  The contour HD wasn't too bad since we stuck it to the observer's helmet and it yielded some great video from his point of view in sync with my footage.  The helo also had a NTSC (640x480) output that I inserted a NTSC multi output amplifier into the line, and stole a copy of the flir image onto tape (that old media) so we could see the flir footage in sd, but then I had to upscale it to 1080p which was messy at best.  It's the reason even though I like the flip minoHD I don't use it as much since its 720P limited which still gives a great picture.  Kodak went the extra mile to 1080P native.This camera is ideal for1 - outdoor use2 - kids to play with (would you rather they play with your $1K camera?)3 - a second view in filming video that will be in NLE editing (or buy 3 of them for 3 matched views!)i'll do some further testing and post video comparisons - the only problem is that amazon's video upload takes 16x9 footage (no matter the resolution) and puts letterboxing on it to fit in their 4x3 video box on the review.  I wish they would have a checkbox for 16:9 or 4:3 so that the box would match the footage.My cons list is pretty short - the camera comes with all the ins and outs you'd want except one.because of the sealed construction (same with the flip minoHD) the battery is sealed inside - this problem transitions from the apple iphone, ipod, etc.  All are sealed packages with lithium batteries inside.  Now my contour HD has swappable batteries, as does my canon hf 10.  Most people would like to carry a second battery in case things go late into the night.  Here - you can get by with a/c power to the camera which is good.Short cons list, good color, good construction, good price, 1080P - this camera hits my favorite list, so even though its got a sealed battery I'm giving it 5 stars.  Borderline 4 stars due to the sealed battery.""
"20110319","2.0","Just OK, not great, but worth it for the price","I don't know why people would give anything higher than two stars. This camera is OK at best.I'll start with the bad:1) Low light shows the weakness in the ccd. Tons of noise in the dark areas, just total chaos. Especially if you move around (Like at a club or party). Even in the daylight technicolor noise can be seen in mid-tones and shadows.2) Packaging. It comes with so little. Just a USB cable, and send away for a HDMI cable? Are you kidding!? Obvious personal-information/advertising ploy and totally unnecessary. Not even a case is included.3) The Battery is not easily replaceable. I haven't looked into how to really open it up (possibly voiding the warranty) to replace it if it DOES die but I wouldn't want to do it away from a clean workbench. I BOUGHT THE AMAZON SUGGESTED BATTERY. DON'T DO IT!!! Currently I'm trying to figure out how to return it to the 3rd party, but since the battery isn't a plug and play deal do not buy it! You're just wasting time.4) Menu navigation is sluggish/laggy but works OK since you won't go to it often and is simple and straightforward.The good:1) If you stick this thing on a tripod, during a sunny day, and set it to either 1080p or 720p -not 720p60- the image is acceptable for a sub $200 camera. Photos are also acceptable, but I've seen sub $150 photo cameras that take better pictures.2) Super fast start-up. Takes pretty much just a one count and its ready to shoot. Very nice.3) Tripod hole on the bottom. Also very nice.4) Not overloaded with a mess of buttons so it's easy to do the major tasks without too much fuss.5) The anti-shake works very very well.Ultimately this Camera is OK, not amazing as the specs -and some suspect reviews- indicate. Tripod daylight use is the best you can get I think in a sub $200 camera. Image quality is good unless you move too much then expect some artifacting. I like to work with 16:9 720p mostly unless I'm filming something in the daytime on a tripod then I'll set it to 16:9 1080p. Reason is there seems to be less artifacting in 720p and its easier to work with on an underpowered Netbook if you are away from your home computer. 720p60 fields is just a Benny Hill show, maybe some will like it, but I think it would also interfere with throughput and create chaos in some situations. So that's all I have to say for the review, I hope it was helpful.""
"20110318","1.0","Poor quality video and even worse photos","This video camera has horrible video quality and even worse picture quality. The video and picture quality is so bad that most modern smart phones can probably do about the same or better, which makes sense since the Kodak PaySport is the same size as a smart phone. If you have a smart phone just use that and/or buy something else for your video camera needs. Thumbs down; don't recommend this product.""
"20110317","3.0","Great cam with one big negative! - UPDATED","I just purchased this camera. It did not arrive yet. Therefore, I will update this with a proper review later.However, I would like to point out one thing. After much research, this camera has everything one may ever want in a small pocket camera, BUT...unlike its predecessor Zx3, this camera has a non-removable Internal Li-Ion battery. Therefore, you will not be able to swap out batteries in the field when one dies.Do not buy 'Kodak Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery/KLIC 7004 $17.52' that Amazon is pushing under 'Frequently bought together' section. You will end up with a battery that you can not use. It is meant for Zx3 model.I would give this camera 5 stars before I even had a chance to play with it, if not for the damn battery! Otherwise, it has everything that Zx3 has that is a great camera still:  -  Waterproof up to 10 ft  -  Full 1080p HD  -  Image stabilization  -  Smart face tracking technology  -  Expandable SD/SDHC card slot (up to 32 GB)  -  slow motion playback  -  comes with all the cables and software you need  -  It can shoot at 720p at 60 fpsNew features:  -  Shockproof and dustproof  -  Share button functionality (like on Cisco Flip)  -  macro mode  -  four options from the effects of capture:  -  sepia, Black & white, vivid, and 1970s styleOne other important feature in my eyes is .MP4 format instead of .MOV.  MP4 format is an industry standard, therefore many more editing software options. With MOV you are very limited!More to come after I receive and test my camera against my Cisco FlipUltra (Gen 3)- - - - - - -  U P D A T E  - - - - - - - - - - - -ANOTHER STAR REMOVED, AND YOU WILL NOT LIKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.I was even thinking to remove two stars. That is how disappointed I am.So, I received my camera. The casing is very nice & rugged. Feels great in my hand. Great shape and size.The setup menu is pretty easy to navigate.On camera editing is ok. It lets you trim your videos right on camera.That is where all good things stop.Video quality is not good. I tested it against the Flip UltraHD, and Flip wins hands down.Colors are horrible on the Zx5. Flip's colors are more true to life.Focus is one of the biggest problems. It just does not focus well. When I use zoom, while it zooms it is all out of whack. And, then it takes about 5 seconds to focus once zoomed in.Focus is even worst in the low light. By low light I mean, in the well lit room, but not in the sunny outside. I could only get it to focus in the day light, and not moving the camera at all.Colors are also bad in the low light. Zx5 does not handle light shift well either.Stabilization does not seem to exist. I tried to keep the camera as steady as possible, but it was still very jumpy.Further, I called my friend who has over 40 years of experience in the industry and asked him for his opinion. He happened to have a guy (his best friend) sitting in his living room who knows even more about it than he does. The 'guy' worked for Arcosft, Canon Video, and other respected companies as the 'brain' behind the development. So, I jumped in my car and drove over to my friend's house with both cameras: Zx5 and Flip UltraHD. We tested the cameras side by side in several different environments. We tried it in several editing software, and both of them concluded that Zx5 is just substandard. Over all, UltraHD is just a much better camera than Zx5. The difference was just that stark!Conclusion:Cisco Flip UltraHD  produces way better quality video that Kodak PlaySport Zx5. It just does!I really wanted to like the PlaySport Zx5. I really did. It is packed with so many great features. Waterproof, shockproof, different resolution settings, video features, etc. However, the most important things that it is intended for - VIDEO - is just not acceptable. Unfortunately, this camera is going back! And, the Flip UltraHD stays.""
"20110314","4.0","2nd Generation PlaySport","Kodak Playsport Zx5, is the more durable, weatherproof replacement for the first generation playsport, the Zx3, this one offers some new features better than the Zx3, yet leaves some features that i yearn they should have left on the Zx5.I am happy with the waterproof feature, its perfect for any summer holiday with your friends or family. However, dont drop it while your swimming because if it sinks deeper than 10 Ft., the pressure will force water through the seals (always use the included lanyard). Also, dont use it on normal beaches as the water usually isnt clear enough to be able to record anything, recording in swimming pools however, is entirely different. The clarity of a pool makes for some interesting recordings underwater that you dont usually see with regular camcorders like the Flip mino.The anti-glare feature is a nice touch, especially on the beach, its a software that artificially reduces the glare from your screen, but it does not effect the recording one bit, just the screen.The menu is pretty cryptic, no words, just alot of symbols which i am fine with, you are gonna read the instructions anyways, and most of the symbols are pretty self explanatory, the only real problem with this is that new people you let borrow the recorder might be a bit confused.Now, what does Kodak Zx5 offers to substitute the previous model?The first feature, sharing button system is created to simplify the video or image sharing process to popular social networks. With its new share button applied on the video camera, I just press a button and the video will be uploaded automatically. But to make it work, it has to be plugged into a computer with the software isntalled. Kodak has also added some new popular social network sites like Flickr, KODAK Gallery, and ORKUT.Second, it has macro mode, which enables me to shoot and focus small objects. This is an interesting feature and in my opinion this is a great main additional feature offered by Kodak. Great for recording small objects such as bugs or items. On recorders without macro, smaller items would just be blurred out of focus if the camera got too close.third, I can play out my creativity with its four capture effects. Theres black and white, sepia, bright colors and even the 70s film style. With this new feature, you can edit and trim your video with any style effects on the unit itself.fourth, the battery is not swappable unlike the zx3, so if you like carrying multiple batteries around for convenience, that's not possible. That sucks because with the zx3 the battery isnt all to expensive and you would carry around one or two extra ones in your bag for backup. For the Zx5, the battery has to be charged again until you can use it which will take a couple hours. For one charge, recording in 720p 64 FPS, i managed 137 minuutes which isnt all to bad, but that means when i go out for travel, i will need to bring the charger and charge at night, a bit of an annoyance, however, i am used to apple products being like this, and i have a usb charger in my car so its not a deal breaker for me.last, all the recorded video files are in .mp4 format instead of the previous .mov format, .mp4 is much more compatible with more programs and easier to edit (as i was so generously reminded by another reviewer). All the files are stored on the HC (high capacity) SD card, i have a 32 GB card in it right now so i can hold up to 10 hours of recording, not bad.Don't be surprised if HDMI cables and other related accessories arnt there as you will have to pay S&H for kodak to ship one to you.The other thing I found is, besides with its waterproof condition, Kodak announces this new model will be shockproof and dustproof too. The previous generation playsport only offered waterproofing up to 10 ft, but i guess if its waterproof, naturally, it should be dust proof too right?Overall, this is a great combination of HD recording filled with editing, social networking, and weatherproofing features.I bought these to help my little brother record his golf swing, i use the 720 64 FPS setting, which helps address parts of his swing that he is doing incorrectly, its no high speed camera, but its nice that such an affordable camcorder will suffice. I can pause at certain parts, and the swing will clearly stop with only little blur, 32 FPS cameras would skip some portions of the swing as there are not enough shots per second to capture many nuances of a fast golf swing.Specs:  * Shockproof, dustproof, and waterproof up to 10 ft  * Kodak's Share button lets you choose your favorite sharing destination, e-mail address, or Kodak Pulse Display  * Full 1080p HD videos and 5 MP HD stills, with auto focus  * Get sharper videos and less blur thanks to built-in digital image stabilization  * On-camera editing  * HD720 at 32 or 64 FPS  * HD1080 at 32 FPS""
"20120417","2.0","Water proof? Not Really...","I was very excited to get this camera. My family and I were going to Myrtle Beach for a much needed vacation and I thought that this camera would be perfect for playing in the pool or at the beach.  As soon as we arrived and unpacked, I put on my bathing suit and into the pool I go with the camera.  It worked fine the first time, but the second time I took it into the pool, I noticed that it had stopped recording and that moisture had built up behind the screen. The camera would not respond to any button presses, and wouldn't power off.  I waited until the battery died and re-charged it the next day. It worked fine, but I wasn't going to take it anywhere near the pool again. It seemed ok, so I used it the rest of the vacation for 'Dry' pictures.  Once I got home, I uploaded the pictures to the computer and about half of them were worthless. Without perfect sunlight the pictures were VERY grainy, and the 'good' ones were poor quality at best. For example the pictures that I took with my iPhone 4 were twice as nice.  They looked great when seeing them on the small screen, but on my CPU they're horrible. What a letdown, I understand why Kodak is getting out of the camera business. This deal is too good to be true!""

"20120409","5.0","What a surprise!! Excellent photos and movies","I bought this camera with the thought of using it on our recent trip to Hawaii when snorkeling. I couldn't be happier with the camera and it's available functions. I took movies of sea turtles swimming along just under the surface of the water as well as colorful fish feeding in the shallows. With the setting at 1080p, I am amazed at the clarity of the videos and the sound recorded, too. The underwater setting does work, the resulting photos and videos being clear and in focus and not needing editing by Photoshop Elements. I did not use the telephoto button as I didn't want to have possible distortion occur. Using the camera on the beach, I took great photos/videos of my grandchildren having a wonderful time digging in the sand and building sand castles. The only recommendation I would make is that when using the camera in salt water, the camera be washed with fresh water immediately after leaving the salt water as the salt, once dried, will make the opening of compartment sliding locks very difficult. This camera far surpasses the yellow Minolta underwater camera I had years ago, especially since it works with a 32GB SD card, offering plenty of storage for filming.""
"20120409","4.0","Great in and out of water","I bought this Kodak zx5 camera to take on a cruise specifically for a snorkel tour.  I carried the camera around much of the time outside of the snorkeling because of its convenient size.  The camera takes great pictures and videos. I does require good lighting conditions and that subjects that don't require too much detail when zooming (digital zooms aren't worth too much). I was more impressed with the still photos than I expected to be.On the snorkel tour is worked wonderfully.  I shot a good hour of video snorkeling and the video came out very clear and with audio (somewhat surprising to me). The reaction from everyone I have showed these video to is 'Wow! That really looks great!' I rinsed the camera thoroughly in a faucet after snorkeling to clean off the salt water and found no water on the inside when checked. The photos and videos play right off the SD card on my laptop or iPad (if you have the iPad camera card reader). I played the videos on a 46' HD tv and they look nice and clear.For the price of this camera I am very happy with the results.

"20120315","5.0","Great little video camera!","I ordered this video camera as a Christmas gift for my grandson (age 11) who had been trying to take videos with a regular camera without much success.  With the Kokak PlaySport, he sets up scenes (using a green screen as a backdrop made from plastic tablecloths) and then he imports the videos into the computer and adds special effects. He also uses it to take still pictures and no longer uses his camera. He hasn't tried to take underwater photos yet, but I'm sure he will someday.  He had this video camera up and running with no adult supervision, except I did show him how to format the memory card.  It is a very durable camera.""
"20120315","5.0","Great for me, great as a gift","We were looking for a waterproof camcorder to take on vacation this spring.  Something simple with decent action shooting.  Planned boating and parasailing and snorkeling.  Bought this before Thanksgiving and took on vacation to my dad's in Montana.  I'm not a great manipulator of digital media, so the best viewing has been to use the included HDMI cable and watch it on a TV or computer monitor.  Watching it on Media Player or Quicktime (nothing 'exotic' for me) was not as nice as on an HDMI TV.  I know there are better versions/packages of software out there to make the viewing on a computer better.  the included software also allows quick uploads to social media, which I don't take advantage of.Bought a second one for my dad after he saw it and expressed interest.  Not often I can find something he might really like as a gift.  Fits in a pocket, point and shoot, decent sound.  He uses it for personal use and land appraisal video notetaking.  The kit has everything to get going.  I think it is better outdoors, with more light, and the still pictures are not as good as our Sony and Olympus digi-cams. Look forward to trying out the waterproof features.  I like that I don't have to put it in a dive box like the Sony.""

"20120308","4.0","Decent Little Video Cam for the Price","Don't expect miracles from Kodak's Zx5, but it does a very good job for the price. Video is smooth at 720p, and the mic does a remarkable job picking up sound. The colors are just a bit on the dull side on the 'Normal' setting, but 'High Saturation' goes a bit overboard for most situations. But, again, at this price, it's not an issue. And it only took about 10 minutes for me to learn all the functions... a nice plus in a world where even basic point-and-shoot cameras often come with 100-page manuals.I've used the Zx5 in a number of situations. It's very easy to hold steady, which makes it a good choice for more active shooting situations. Not having an optical zoom is a drawback, but it's better than not having a decent camera at all. I haven't had to test the 'waterproof & shockproof' claims yet, but it's nice to know I can shoot in the rain or in extreme situations. Plus, the Zx5 is easy to carry around on my belt in a small case. I hardly know it's there, but it's at hand whenever I need it.The Zx5 has a 4x digital zoom. I've tested it, and - like all digital zooms - it yields crappy results. Don't even bother with it. On the other hand, it has a 'Share' button that makes uploading to social networking sites a snap. I avoid most of these sites, so it's of no use to me... but for other folks, that may be a plus.Kodak will be exiting the camera business in July... and some of their support docs have already disappeared from their website. But if you're looking for a handy little video camera, the Zx5 is worth a look anyway.""

"20120306","5.0","Awesome for the money","I bought this for a trip to Mexico to use as a camera, found that it took pretty good pictures and at a $100 new was a great deal.The autofocus takes a second to focus, so you do need to hold the camera still for a few seconds to get a really sharp picture. That being said, the camera shoots great movement and action shots.The camera is waterproof. I took mine snorkeling and swimming several times, never had a problem and it actually took pretty darn good pictures underwater.I read some of the other reviews about the waterproof latches being an issue, but did not find it that way at all. Actually found the latches to be well designed, and so long as you actually use the lock and don't try to force them, you will find them quite solid. Note that after being under salt-water, the lock to the latch was HARD to open, but that is because of the salt and particles in the water. Rinse with warm, freshwater, towel dry then go ahead and open it.Pros-Camera is compact (about the size and shape of an iPhone) and has rounded edges, making it ideal for just carrying around in your pocket.Takes great pictures and videos outdoors.Only a $100.With a decent memory card, you get thousands of pics on the highest resolution settings.Battery life is excellent. Single charge will last for hundreds of pictures over several days. Should be good for a few hours of video shooting before needing to recharge.Turns on/boots up very quickly. allowing you to take pictures quicklyHas a decent zoom abilityTook mine down about 20 feet underwater, worked just fine, no leaks, good pics.Would definitely recommend for someone looking for an inexpensive, waterproof camera that they can carry around in their pants/shorts pocket, especially for outdoor use.Cons-Does not take pictures well in really low light or at night. Needs good light or outdoors to really get the pictures you want.Takes a few seconds for the camera to autofocusonly 5mp, but really if you allow it to focus, you will get great pictures/video.""
"20120305","5.0","Wow, what a great little camera","I bought the red camera used (like-new) from Amazon Warehouse for $84 and received it on Friday (3/2) and charged it up overnight. The next day I took it with us to the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo as the perfect test for it since we would be walking around in bright sunlight with lots of motion and colors around us.This little camera passed with flying colors. First of all I just want to make one thing straight, this camera is NOT intended to replace your average camcorder that comes with all the bells and whistles that you're afraid of damaging or losing in public. This camera is a fun, simple, and inexpensive way to capture life on the go especially when dealing with spur of the moment situations involving the outdoors and your family. Fits in your pocket very easily (smaller than most cell phones).I tried all the video resolutions and effects as we walked around and found both the 720p settings to be ideal. The 720p/60 setting is better suited for sports or rapidly moving environments such as white water rafting I would assume, because the playback was too 'crisp' and exact like a high speed shutter camera. Great for those speedy situations but a little dizzying when watching leisure outings of your family on your HDTV. The regular 720p setting was more smooth and lifelike while still providing great detail of your subjects.Operation of the camera is what sells it for me. If you are used to taking pictures with your cell phone then you already know how to use this camera. It was so easy to capture high definition video on the fly by simply holding up this small and unobtrusive device among the crowds at the petting zoo for example or as we maneuvered through the tight crowds at the carnival.Sound was good and I did not get any of that 'wind' noise even though it was gusty at times as we walked around the Rodeo grounds.Playback was also simple as all you have to do is hook it up straight to your HDTV via a mini-hdmi to hdmi cable (bought separately) and press 'play'.Overall, this camera will suit active families where an expensive camera might be overkill especially if going outdoors. Simple to use and easy to operate with just one hand.Hint: Get the blue or red one as this makes it easy to find and identify wherever you place it.""

Replaceable batteryZX5 cons:1. Muddy and unclear video, compared to Zi82. Screen has very limited viewing angles3. No manual macro switch4.

"20120228","5.0","I wish I wasn't afraid of the water","I purchased a Kodak PlaySport waterproof video camera for my wife last year, and I purchased this one for my school. I am a principal, and I need something that can withstand the daily thrashing that a 5-year-old can lay down. This is the camera. When there is a school event happening, I can pull out this camera and not have to worry about a student kicking it over while on the tripod, knocking it out of my hand, or throwing up on it. The waterproof feature is great for water days, hanging out in the pool, or going to the beach. I've got some great videos of my three-year-old learning to jump in the pool by herself and was able to follow her from the edge of the pool, into the water, and down below the pool surface. The one downside is that there is no flash/light on this camera, but I have been extremely pleased with it in all normal light situations where I've used it. This is the best video camera I have owned, and the size makes it extremely handy to carry around.""
"20120228","5.0","Really Pleased With It :),","I needed HD video camera for a class. I looked at many different ones on Amazon. Cheaper and more expensive ones but decided to go ahead and order this one. I am so glad I did. This camera arrived few hours ago. I honestly really like it. Its cute, light weight, durable, easy to set up and use, I tried to charge it and its charging with no problems. I really like the video quality, it is really good. Over all I am really really pleased :). Oh I forgot to mention... You will have to buy a memory card with it because it does not come with any memory to do any recording. I got a 16GB memory card and it lasts for 4 hours and 19 minutes of video recording time... and about 11,500 pictures...""
"20120227","5.0","Excellent","Gee, all you guys having problems with this camcorder. What memory card are you using because maybe that is your problem. Also, check your firmware by going into the menu and scrolling down until you find 'about' and it will tell you. It should be 1.06 that came out last Aug 2011. It fixes the freezing problem and other problems.Now if you are gonna do the WATER test,make sure everything is closed properly. It has waterproof seals but you do have to make sure they are all closed. Also tell anyone who uses it in water to go slow and make sure it doesn't go below 9 feet.  If a seal comes loose underwater , you are screwed.It just makes sense that when people find out it's a waterproof camcorder they think they can give it to child or adult who knows nothing about the camcorder and they can play with it in water. Come on, common sense, please.It's a good pocket camcorder that does shoot in 1080p mode or 720p in at either 60fps or 30 fps. And it does take pretty good videos. If you are not sure, go on You Tube and check for yourself, there are plenty of people that have videos using this camcorder. If people list problems with this camcorder , check the date when they posted the video because it could have been before the Aug 2011 update.A 16 gig Class 10 card is good for about 3 hours 1080p or 720p x60fps of recording.The battery lasts around 2 1/2 hours.What is nice about this compared to iphone is that you can put it in rough situations and it should be ok and if something goes wrong you don't lose a very expensive IPHONE, just a  cheap 1080p camcorder. :)Another way to look at this camcorder is , YES, it is waterproof for underwater. But, I'm not interested in it from that angle, I'm interested because it is RAINPROOF, meaning, if it rains or if I want to leave the camcorder out in the backyard and capture NATURE, or bird feeder for a few hours on rainly/cloudy day , I don't have to worry.  All my other camcorders I would have to worry about doing that. You kidding me, if it rains with my other camcorders I freak out and put it in case fast.Also, if you get camcorder freeze, what class memory card are you using, try another. It has to be a relatively fast card because it's capturing in 1080p.""

"20120223","1.0","Not Waterproof!","I purchased this for my husband's birthday.  He wanted to be able to use a small underwater camera on our vacation during our time snorkeling in several places.  Prior to that we used it to video our 5 year old and were pleased with the ease of use.  Spontaneity is key with young children and for that purpose this was nice.  That said we could have purchased a flip or some other more basic video camera had we known that this was not going to be waterproof.  The 1st time we used it underwater, not more than 4 or 5 ft depth it allowed water into the sd card area.  Damaged all the video we had taken of our trip thus far as well as completely shorted out and is now useless.  Because of that I cannot recommend this whatsoever.""
"20120223","1.0","Stay Away!","After reading multiple (negative) reviews on this camera, I purchased it anyway- with the 'that won't happen to me' mindset. Well, it did.I currently own a GoPro camera (which I LOVE and would give 5 stars too), but, mine is the older edition- so it does not have the view screen on the back. So, I went out on a limb and purchased this camera.I took the camera out and played around with it- taking movies and stills. After about 5 minutes, the camera froze up on me. I had to do a hard reset in order to unfreeze it. I returned to taking pictures... and after the first one, the camera froze again. I played this game for several minutes- before deeming this product unreliable.I would stay away from this camera!""
"20120223","4.0","Great pocket cam but screen cover gets scratched up easily.","I've had this camera for a while and there have already been a few updates for the firmware over the last several months. It has helped out with start up time and performance. I don't use the built in share software as I like to edit my videos before uploading them to youtube or wherever...The built in 'image stabilization' is a digital type vs optical, so while it's not optimal it's pretty good compared to not having any kind of stabilization. There is an optional remote that will work with this unit and allow you to start and stop recording which is a nice plus.Recording options: There are quite a few options on this unit so fleiblity is nice.720p 30fps or 60fps (frames per second)1080p 30fpsWVGA which is basically an SD wide screen resolution, 848 x 480. yes it's more than standard definition but it's just a wide screen stand definition. This is at 30fps and this format will allow you to record a lot longer on the same size card. instead of just over 2 hours on an 8gig card I can get 3 1/2 hours according to the camera.Microphone Gain, what a nice add, all too often the microphone on pocket cams will just get overloaded with sound from your surroundings and end up with very bad sound, so it's nice to be able to turn the gain down when needed or up if needed.The effects that it has built in the camera can be fun to mess with at times but I prefer clean natural video, I don't care for those particular gimmick type features too much. If I want to make video B&W or whatever I'll just do that when I edit it later on.Water resistance, this is pretty cool, I took this on a trip to the beach with the family and luckily I live along the gulf and get nice clean water at the beach so underwater views aren't as good as they could be but they are pretty good. The built in correction on the camera seems to function pretty good as well.It has some pretty good light response in most all situations and I haven't seen much of a bad result for light conditions as of yet.Overall, the camera performs pretty good but the one issue that I have with it is that the rear screen cover on mine has gotten scratched up pretty easily. My other pocket cams haven't gotten this much damage and I treat them the same, I would definitely encourage a screen protector.I did run into one issue with video getting a little strange when my friend was revving his bike but it didn't actually affect the video too much but it was still noticeable to a degree, also the mic didn't respond too well right next to the bike which shows that mic just doesn't like the popping pressure of a v-twin 1300cc motor.. lol. I'm working on getting a go-pro for that kind of stuff though.Still a really good camera for general use and the price is right as well. I hope to see more come from pocket size cameras in the future, it would be nice to see some kind of optical zoom ability one day on these kind of cameras.""

The clear audio underwater was unexpected!  It stayed waterproof the whole week of being submerged while snorkeling and being in a sandy environment.  The playback is instant with no lag and VERY easy to upload and share my videos.  It did lack in video quality when in dim light and using the zoom feature.  Zooming in and out was not as smooth as I hoped, but I can easily deal with that.  Recharging the internal battery is with USB only and takes some time when fully depleted.
