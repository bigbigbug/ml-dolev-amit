"20120610","5.0","Buying your first DSLR? Get this one.","As my first DSLR camera, this is an excellent choice. You can start out slow, using more automatic setting modes, but advance quickly to customizing every detail of every exposure.It feels very sturdy, and is much lighter than I anticipated (but that's not a bad thing). Nice hand-grip area, and everything feels comfortable in my larger-than-average hands. My wife, with much smaller hands, can also comfortably hold and handle it, able to access all necessary buttons and features while shooting.Overall it's a great camera. I'm pleased with the 18-55 kit lens, and plan to stick with this camera for 3-4 years while building my lens library and getting some shooting experience.""
"20120605","5.0","Excellent camera","I needed a good camera for taking close up pictures of jewelry.  Anyone who has every photographed jewelry knows what a complete pain it is.  I had the right lighting system, and now I have the right camera to take the pictures.  The 55 MM lens is perfect for close up shots and being able to adjust the shutter speed, ISO and aperture were vital to the success of my jewelry photography.  I didn't know much about cameras until I bought this one, and I'm glad I did.  It was recommended to me from another jewelry photographer.  I recommend this camera to everyone!""
"20120603","4.0","Great Camera for the Price.","Overall I am very, very satisfied with my Canon T3. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to get into DSLR photography.The only small complaints I have...1. Viewfinder and LCD screen are a bit on the small side. It is fine for a while, but after a full day of shooting, I find it does become noticeable.2. Camera mode- Very long distance on the dial between the manual modes and the movie mode. Makes spur of the moment movies a little more challenging without missing the beginning of what is going on. I am pleased with the movie quality though.  Put on a lens in manual focus and shallow depth of field and it is quite pleasing.3.  Biggest regret- Wish I got the body only and got a 17-50mm f/2.8 in place of the kit lens.  The kit lens certainly isn't horrible.  I have just come to find that after using my other lenses, it just really lacks low light functionality and seems to really lack the 'pop' that my other lenses have.  I find the images just look uninspiring no matter how well composed.  The images are sharp.  My complaint is more so based on color and contrast.  Obviously not having a larger aperture is a big part of the issue.Other than these few points, I can't say anything bad about this camera.  In fact, if I had to purchase a second body, I would be very likely to get another T3.  There are obviously much better cameras out there, but bang for the buck, this thing is pretty darn good.""

Easy to use and understand and the features are nice, yet not too complicated.  However, I am most disappointed in the zoom - or lack there of.

I was actually set on purchasing the Nikon D3100 until a special popped up on the T3.  Because of the great price I took a 2nd look, and I am sure glad I did!  Me and my wife had a very nice point and shoot camera before, so I wasn't sure that I really needed to spend the money on a nice DSLR.  The difference is very noticle even to 2 people with no DSLR experience.  The videos are awesome, the pictures are amazing (even if you don't know what your doing), and it is extremely easy to use.  My favorite thing about it is how fast it recovers and takes pictures. I will and have recommended this camera to family and friends.""
"20120113","5.0","Just got it","I literally JUST got this camera in today.  I didn't purchase it from Amazon sadly because, well long story short, I decided to refresh my browser before check out to see the price had gone up $20, oh well.  I still can leave my current thoughts after an hour of playing around with it.  I am a newbie, this is actually my first personal digital camera, I am only 18 and decided to splurge for a nice Canon DSLR my mother wasn't too happy about me buying.First off, It really would be nice if it came with some type of even marginal SD card. I did order that off of Amazon but it still hasn't come so I had to settle for the one in my Dad's camcorder for now.  The instructions are alright, skimming through but, for instance, the 'attaching and detaching section' doesn't say how to detach and since I am still new at this, it took me a few minutes to realize what that side button next to the lense was for.I am still really new at this but the live view mode is a really big hassle for me as well.  It is easier just using the view-finder to take the pics instead of seeing them on the screen because it shoots faster.  My newbie ways aren't helping me in that front.Overall though, this camera is fantastic.  It looks good, a bit scary at first when you see all those buttons if it is your first camera but once you get the hang of it, you will have a blast.  Since I still JUST got it, I will most likely update this review at some point.""

I just wanted to give people a heads up -- DO THE MATH!! Sometimes it is cheaper to buy the camera and the telephoto lens separately... as much as $120 cheaper if you shop around. Sometimes this bundle will price itself low enough to be worth the money. Sometimes not. So be careful and don't just buy this up. As of the moment I am writing this, you'd save $70 on Amazon buying the two products seperately. That, of course, is subject to change.Happy shopping!""

"20120110","4.0","Nice entry level SLR camera","I am by no means a photographer, but I really enjoy using this camera.  It has a nice sized lcd screen that is pretty clear, although hard to see in direct sunlight.  Takes great, crystal clear pictures and has many features that can make an amateur photographer look like a professional.  I particularly like the sports mode which helps you take multiple photos of moving objects very quickly.My only complaint with the camera, and this is why I didn't give five stars, is that the auto focus can take a long time to work.  I usually just put it in manual mode, because the wait for focus can often times cause you to miss the shot you wanted.  Especially a problem when photographing animals or children, neither of which stay still very long.Overall a great entry level camera that I would recommend to anyone trying to get their feet wet in photography.""

"20120109","5.0","Canon T3 - A nice camera!!","I recently decided to get a camera that could take photos of objects that were farther away, as I have an impending vacation where a lot of the views are going to be difficult to capture.  My current point and shoot with digital zoom lens was just not doing what I wanted it to do.  I started looking at Canon Rebel products and settled on the T3 model.  This camera allowed a 'rookie' like me to be able to auto set the camera to get started, and then progress to various settings as I became more familiar with it.  I did purchase the additional 55-250mm lens to go along with the 18-55mm one that came with it.Overall, what helped sell me on this camera?....... the autofocus and stablizer features to start with, then the overall price that I found the camera and lenses here on Amazon.  (No other dealer, either online or locally in Phoenix has since beat the price in their ads).I was also looking for a camera that I could use the live view in the rear screen as well as the viewfinder.  I wear glasses and this sometimes does not make the small viewfinder the easiest to use.  One additional feature I found appealing was the video recording function.  I carry a 16gb SD card for photos, and when I know I will be doing video I have another 16gb SD card to use.One disappointment was the instruction manual....while the included paper manual gave some startup tips, the more in-depth manual is on the included CD and not at all convenient to have available if you need to look up a questioned feature.  I ended up buying a 'Dummies' book that makes the learning curve a lot easier.Overall I am impressed with the feel of the camera in my hands, and the nice quality photos that it takes.  I would highly recommnend this camera to anyone that wants to 'step up' a notch to a better than point and shoot style camera.""

The live view is a big plus and I like the fact that all my lenses and flash are compatible. I must admit that although the results aren't in the same league with the 5D, I'm blown away with the quality, even with the consumer grade lens.  This is an entry level camera, but Canon has done a remarkable job with it.  However, I must admit it looks a little strange with a 70-200mm L lens on the front!Henrik Hansen, DDS""

"20111227","5.0","Great First Time Camera!","With the hope and enthusiasm of getting into the world of photography, I was looking for a great introductory level DSLR camera that I could get my hands on. After everything I read it came down to being between Nikon D3100 and the Canon EOS T3. In the end, the majority came to the conclusion that though the T3 was cheaper in build quality than the Nikon, the Canon T3 took overall better pictures. And in the end what sealed this deal was the $449 purchase price with no tax and shipping through Amazon; Amazing! Anyways, I've now had the camera for a few weeks, and absolutely love it! One of the best features, and what makes it great for a novice photographer is the guide feature that comes with this camera, which can be turned on or off. Basically what it does is describe what each and every function of the camera does from the P, Tv, Av, M settings to the little manual adjusted functions such as exposure, shutter speed, and aperture. This along with some simple reading has allowed me to learn the basic ins and outs of using an SLR camera rather quickly.

I have had tons of family and friends comment on how photogenic my kids are since we had this camera (no one said that before because it was near impossible to get a good one).  Well worth the money.  I am not tech savy at all but my husband is.  he loves to fiddle around and do all the tricky stuff and has a blast.

"20111206","5.0","Great beginner DSLR","I am a 21 year old female in college and I bought myself this camera right before Thanksgiving. I paid, myself, $488, for it and for what you get, this is a great camera. Yes, some other people have said it is a little slippery and it looks 'cheapy' but, I don't really care how it looks, I care how it performs. And I have utlized a few of the options such as 'Portrait,' 'Full Auto,' and 'Flash Off' a lot within the few weeks I have had it and, gosh it is SO MUCH BETTER than a point a shoot. I have a Canon point and shoot and, thought that is nice because it's small, the picture quality started to annoy me. The Canon Rebel T3 has great picture quality, I am absolutely impressed. And, incase you are a newbie to camera buying, megapixels DO NOT matter with regards to picture quality; so don't think you have to buy a 18.8 megapixel camera to get a great picture. That just allows you to print bigger sized pictures (if you don't want the normal 4 x 6). So I have been using the 'Flash Off' to take pictures of my cats and, I am truely impressed. On a point and shoot camera, it is almost useless to try and take a picture with the flash off, let alone for a moving object like a cat. The Canon Rebel T3 takes vivid pictures, it also takes great portraits and works well just with Full Auto. There are also Creative Options if you are a  photographer and want to tweak the settings yourself. I am a beginning photographer and I have not yet utilized these settings but I will update my review once I do so. This camera is also a very nice size if you want a better camera than a point a shoot but don't want to commit to a mammoth SLR. It is a great in-between size and could easily fit in a medium sized purse for a woman, if you so choose to carry it that way. Overall, I am so impressed with what you get with this camera for the money I spent. Well done, Canon.""
"20111206","5.0","Must have for families with kids!","I wanted a camera that would literally allow me to capture 'a moment in time'.  I purchased it when my baby was 2 months old, frustrated with my small digital camera that would get the picture AFTER our baby quit smiling.  We have owned this camera for over 2 months and it has not let us down!  The shutter speed is very quick, and you can take multiple pictures quickly.  It's durable, lightweight, and takes excellent pictures.  Best yet, the price is very competitive--not to mention the money we've saved by not having to hire a professional photographer each month!!""
"20111204","5.0","T3: My Advancerment from Point and Shoot to DSLR","I give my EOS Rebel T3 a 5* rating: it is more than i expected!! I have an elaborate set-up for the OM/2 gathering dust.  But, having done a lot of photography with the OM/2 I had a set of expectations: The Rebel T3 needed to do the same sort of things that the OM/2 camera system did.First off was evaluation of the lens. The Rebel cameras using the APS-C sensor (22.2 x 14.8mm) have a 'crop factor' of 1.6 which means you take the focal length of an EF-S type lens times 1.6 to get the equivalent 35mm 'full frame' focal length.  So the lens that comes with the T3 is 18-55 mm APS-C or ~ 28 to 90 in full frame (36 x 24 mm) 35mm format. Close focus capability is included.  This is an excellent lens to start out with.  The old advice, when purchasing a camera: get and keep the standard lens certainly apples here.  This 18-55 lens is also called the 'Kit' lens and it is  ideal for every day shooting, including birthday parties and such.In learning Digital Photography I have found the T3 to be a good 'stepping stone': it includes a number of 'pre sets': or 'automatic' modes for portraits, pets, close ups, sports, landscapes, automatic, night and such that let you take the camera out of the box, charge the battery and start taking great pix with only a brief session with the 'getting started' manual. You do need to learn to charge the battery and install and format the memory card ( be sure to buy one ). And get the lens hood if you shoot out doors. Set the camera on AUTO and go to it!!  You can learn to use the additional features at your own speed, as you need them.The package includes a CD with some *very* good photo editing tools that let you download pix from the camera and then edit your collections.  Great stuff, very useful if you like to Play with Pix on Computer -- as is very popular these days!!Speaking of Playing with Pix on Computer if you are into OnLine sharing, FB, Windows/Live etc you will likely find images in the range of 1024x768 pix are adequate for casual online sharing. Images online do not need to be larger than you can display on-screen.  For this reason the 12 m/px T3 will probably be all that is needed for sharing pix online.  12 m/px is 4272x2848 -- much bigger than you need for on-line sharing!!* The 18 m/px of the T3i would be desirable for higher level work, particularly printing where you will want to change the image to 300 dpi or even to 1200 lines/inch.  But that is another subject entirely; those interested in this area will likely want to start looking at the EOS 60D and possibly settle on a full frame model discussion of which is beyond my level of expertise.  Although it appears to me that improvements in the sensors -- APS-C and now Nikon's CX -- are going to obsolete the old 36x24mm 'full frame' systems.  'IMHO', anyway.  Check out stuff done with the G12 -- using a 1/1.7 (7.6 x 5.7 mm ) sensorLast but not least: the T3 is a great 'stepping stone' offering 'point and shoot' or camera control as photographer's choice, and as the EF-S type lenses are compatible through the EOS/Rebel line generally -- a lens that you add for the T3 might be used also on a T3i or 60D that you add later -- which you won't do if you go into a 'high end' 'point and shoot'.I have already added the EF-S 15-85 IS lens; I'll comment on that, in a month or so.* the Digital Photo Professional software -- included with the camera -- will let you re-size -- and you can even do a whole set of images in a single 'batch' operation -- after you have your selections to upload.  Although the camera will let you shoot smaller size original images, I wouldn't do that: If you get a good one: you can't go back and say: I want full resolution.  Better to shoot all originals at full resolution.""
"20111201","5.0","Great DSLR","As my first DSLR, I am loving this camera. I moved up from a Nikon S3000 point and shoot (which takes good photos for a point and shoot), and was going to move to the D3100 but decided on the T3 because of its Auto Exposure Bracketing feature (a must have if you want to take HDR)and cheaper price. The camera is very easy to use and has great image quality. There is a nice built in guide that tells you what each setting is so that you will never have to google it. It also has good quality video (720p at 30fps or 25fps). It has a HDMI out for connecting to TVs and such. RAW files work great with Lightroom 3, though noise can been seen on the images even at low ISOs (which Lightroom can take care of). Focus range on the kit lens is 0.8ft, but you can focus on a subject and then use the zoom to get in closer, giving you a macro like image. Overall very happy with this camera. Got a great price on it here at Amazon ($450, no tax, free two day shipping :)Would definitely recommend to someone else. Going to upload photos here on the product page as soon as I can.""

"20111126","5.0","Great DSLR camera","I purchased this camera recently after a lot of research on the best cameras for low-light environments (was also interested in other photo environments, but low-light environments without flash was one of the most important 'features' to me). I've since taken over 2,000 pictures and have been very happy with the results. Even though it's a lot bulkier than a compact point-and-shoot camera I use it a lot to take pictures of my 10 month old son since it's great for tricky light situations and resets just about instantly. It may sound odd, but we run a 'ghost tour' (in Fort Collins, Colorado) and this is one of the cameras I use to get certain affects in extremely low-light conditions (e.g. tunnels, basements, and structures without electricity). Going for a more 'ghoulish' look I was actually a little frustrated at first at how remarkably clear and 'normal' I could get pictures from the T3 when I really tweaked the manual settings! If you get this camera and really want to master all that it has to offer, I also recommend picking up the Course Technology book on the T3 by David Busch (ISBN-13: 978-1-4354-6026-3).""
"20111125","5.0","GREAT BALANCE BETWEEN PRICE AND PERFORMANCE","The T3 is in the bottom of the entry level line up, but it performs very well. In terms of picture quality when compared with higher end models all the way to the 60D, it is difficult to determine any differences between them.The biggest sacrifices are ergonomics and features like frames per second and flip screens, but I have to tell you that it is a great starting point for any enthusiast wanting to discover DSLR photography. ISO 6400 is really helpful when compared with models like the XS which Canon stop showing in their website; the XS was Canon's entry level before the T3 but it only had ISO 1600 (useless). ISO 6400 with Photoshop Lightroom 3 makes unwanted grain a thing of the past.The camera is small and convenient; I recommend buying the body only and getting and upgraded lens instead of using the 18-55 kit les that comes with it. Good quality pictures come from high quality lenses, so save the money from the kit lens, and buy an upgraded lens like the Canon 24-70L for people with money or the Tamron 17-50 2.8 for people on a budget that want a good balance between price and quality.The bottom line is the lens is more important than the camera if comparing all Canon models under $1000.00. Good luck with your choice.""

"20111019","5.0","Fantastic beginner DSLR","I barely started to get into the DSLR cameras, and I didn't know which one to start. Then after a long research of the DSLR cameras, I came across this model, the Canon EOS Rebel T3. And to be honest, I bought this camera from reading the OTHER reviews, and everyone had stated the same statements that I'm making right now, which is saying that Canon Rebel T3 is a great starter for those people who are starting to get into DSLR cameras. I won't go too much into detail because those are already stated under the description and product overview, but I will say that it's got basic shooting settings, such as close-up, sports mode, portrait mode, regular full shot, etc.For those who are wondering if this camera can record videos: it CAN record videos but it is NOT HD. It's your average quality and I'd compare it to that of a camcorder. It still does record quite well; the video quality is great for a camera that is only meant for picture usage. the built-in sound recorder captures pretty well sounds, without sounding too fuzzy and static-like.As for the lens, it's the standard 18-55mm, which isn't bad. But after awhile, you'll be craving for other better lens, which are just as expensive as the camera, if not more. That is the only 'downer', I guess you can call it.All in all, it's a great starter camera and if you are looking for a cheap but great(for what it is) DSLR camera, this one is perfect for you.""
"20111014","5.0","great entry-level dslr, at a killer price","Keeping it simple - this is our first dslr, but view it as a stepping stone for sometime in the future. Comparing this against even the used options on craigslist, the price was just too hard to pass up ($510, amazon prime). The best used alternative would've been a similar entry-level, 2-5 years old, with two lenses if it was at the older end. Getting a new camera, with zero shutter actuations and a new battery was worthwhile, mainly because we knew we'd be hooked on dslr's once we got one. We had such good results with previous canon point-and-shoots, that we opted to go for the T3 over a Nikon D3100, despite the apparent disadvantages in specs. It's just so darn user-friendly, I can't imagine anything being easier, but I will say we are somewhat biased (I keep saying 'we' - my wife and I are photo nerds, but mostly amateur, and between off-roading and outdoor adventures, to artsy photo creations, to indoor action with two young kids, we kinda cover a large range of 'users'). After a short time with this camera, I won't go into the details as many others have. It just works well, and it's easy. Even better is that it's as helpful as you want it to be - very tunable in terms of auto functions and helpful hints, but easily removed if you gain experience and don't want to be babied. Seems to be an awesome, affordable intro to dslr tech.""

I did lots of research, did read lots of bogs, reviews and comments and finally concluded to buy this one.

Its real good camera if you are beginner and want to learn the DSLR and photography before you switch on to a real expensive stuff.I would highly recommend this one for beginners and learners. You won't regret with the buy.The cam size and grip is good to hold and its real easy to use. It comes with a battery, power cable, charger and system cable. Also the basic guide book is given by canon.Amazon's price was slightly more (some 5-10 $$ diff) than the price offered by other vendors/stores but then with the free shipping and timely delivery promise of Amazon i would prefer Amazon than other vendors. Amazon is trust worthy and you will get the genuine product on time.I would highly recommend Amazon and Canon EOS Rebel T3. :)""
"20110916","5.0","Pleasantly Satisfying","This camera offers a wide spectrum of features.  Point and shoot enthusiasts will love the results.  Manual photographers will have to learn a few buttons and menus, and will be rewarded with great shots for their efforts. The 'Q' button is the secret to navigating the on-screen menu.  Manual shoot offers a quick wheel to change the shutter speed, but you'll have to hold down the 'AV +/- trash' button while simultaneously spinning the wheel to change the aperture setting.  It's the same wheel/button combo for exposure compensation in other modes.I graduated from a Canon G5 to this T3 DSLR and I am very pleased with the upgrade.  I'm able to utilize some of the Canon menu and navigation from the G5, and with a little help from the pdf version of the manual, I quickly acquainted myself with the M, Av, Tv, & P settings.  The 8 basic modes are self-explanatory.  The 'A-DEP' automatic depth-of-field setting is just more icing on the cake.At this price point it's a bonus that the camera shoots video.  'Entry-level' DSLR cameras are a strange breed: avid photographers bemoan their lacklustre features, while point and shoot graduates are offered many features that they will probably never use.  A good photographer can take great shots with an old Pentax K1000 + an appropriate lens, and this T3 offers the same high performance potential at a very reasonable price, plus it's point and shoot results are fabulous.  Everyone should be happy.""

"20110903","5.0","Amazing results for the beginner","I bought this camera upgrading from a PowerShot S95 and was a little skeptical about it because I typically like to get the 'higher-end' type items, like the S95 to the PowerShot series, but in the world of DSLRS that puts you in the range of $1000+ just for the starter kit lens and body.  Some online reviews also nit pick this camera because it doesn't feel professional and lacks a super detailed screen.  While these are completely valid points, I find the fact that this camera out performs any short comings when in the hands of a beginner.  I am producing amazing results and am blown away with the flexibility of the options once I dig a little deeper into how to use them (P, Tv, Av)  I am finding myself becoming obsessed and always thinking about photography now that I have this tool to introduce me to this new world.  There is no contest in the pictures the S95 takes and this.  The battery life is ridiculous- I used it all afternoon shooting continuous high shutter speed in Av for about 600 shots and 7 minutes of HD video and its still showing that I haven't dented the remaining battery life.  I also picked up a 55-250MM IS lens which has made my zoom range cover a good distance so I'm able to take pictures at sporting events from the stands.  The kit lens is more than adequate for simple portraits and landscapes.  Definitely get a flash though, the flash range on this one is pretty much a joke.  I can safely recommend this camera to anyone looking to step up to a DSLR but doesn't want to dive right into a 1000 dollar system.  Eventually, I can see myself growing out of this camera.  I'm sure after about 250000 shots I will be ready for something a little more 'professional' or  'pro-sumer' but right now the bang-for-the-buck has totally been pegged by Canon with the T3.""

"20120514","5.0","Great bang for your buck","What's to say that hasn't been said? Yes, costs were cut making a budget EOS Camera for the 'every man'. Thank you Canon for reaching out and up in design and thinking. All the gripes people have about this camera crack me up. It's a great beginner, but suits the seasoned photographer as well. I read where someone called it 'plasticky'... people complained that it didn't shoot video in standard def... if you change lenses, it will shoot in standard, for the record.I put a grip on mine, bought some old vintage lenses, threw on some filters and a tulip hood... upgraded the memory card... and after shooting up about 3 cards full of photos as well as 3 full of film since Christmas, I gotta think the world is filled with a bunch of malcontents.Sure... there are gobs and gobs of better more expensive camera's out there, but if this thing came out 10 years ago it would be the most amazing cutting edge tool on the market today. Don't let any bad, picky reviews fool you. This thing is pure Canon soul. I LOVE MINE!!!""
"20120507","5.0","Wonderful Camera!","There's nothing more really to say than what I stated in my review title. It's a great camera, not very heavy and is easily transportable. Takes wonderful pictures and videos. The only complaint I would have is that the accessories for this bad boy are so expensive!""
"20120504","5.0","This is all you need in a DSLR","First thing to get out of the way is that if you need a DSLR mainly for photography (not videography) then you can't go wrong with this one. The thing that will make any difference in your photos/results is NOT the camera body; its your skills/vision/compositions AND the lenses you have. Save money on body, buy this cheaper unit and use your saving to buy a second lens (the 50mm f1.8 is a MUST HAVE).Now onto why i really like this camera:1. Obviously the price! Espacially when paying more does not get you much more. This is espacially true for people who are looking for their first DSLR. These camera and their accessories WILL get expensive. As i said, the camera body is where you can cut some corners without impacting your end-results much. Buying it during holidays saves you more with deals and packages floating around.2. Battery life: My first DSLR was a Rebel XSi. It was very good but the best part was battery life - outstanding! Later i upgraded to T1i and sold my XSi. The T1i offers higher resolution LCD screen BUT that also causes the battery to drain much faster. This T3 is infact sort of a clone of XSi - same resolution, same kind of LCD and yes, same great battery life!3. Light weight: Its also very light and won't cause any trouble even after a whole day of shooting/wearing this on your neck. If you pair it with a light-weight prime lens like 50mm 1.8 or 35mm 2.0 (i would highly recommend both) - the whole package becomes a light-weight amazing photos machine.4. Easy to use: Perfect for beginners and offers much room to grow/get serious with your stuff. If you are coming from a point-and-shoot, it can act like one where you don't have to worry about any settings at all.This is my 2nd body along with my T1i - notice that i did not call it a 'backup camera' - it is infact one of my primary camera. I grab either one depending on which one has the lens mounted that i need at the moment.Final note: I was a Canon-guy and Canon was first to bring the affordable DSLR to market so i went with their product. If you are just starting, it might be worth looking at Nikon D3100 as i've heard that is a better entry-level camera. But if you already have a collection of Canon lenses (or like them more), this is your camera.""
"20120502","5.0","Excellent Camera","I had used a few point and shoot cameras before, but I felt like getting into DSLR's. And good thing I chose this camera. Works like a charm. The auto moodes are great for first time photographers, and the manual mode is not as intimidating as other cameras. So if you are just getting into photography, it's a great price and an excellent camera.""
"20120430","5.0","Love this camera","I purchased this camera about a month ago.  This is my first SLR and I love it.  My biggest issue with my point and shoot digital is that it was too slow.  The continuous shooting feature solves this problem.  I have been able to take some pretty amazing pictures with this and find it hard to believe I will outgrow this camera anytime soon.  It's super easy to use and I love 'playing' with all the features and learning what settings create the best pictures.  Although I rarely use the extra lens, I'm definitely glad I have it for the future.  This lens is going to be great for shooting my son participating in sports and such.  I would recommend this Cannon to any person who has never had a SLR camera and wants to graduate to something a bit more serious than a Powershot type of camera.""
"20120429","5.0","An excellent choice for beginners","The camera is great and easy to use. I did not face any problems with the lens, the picture quality, the battery.

"20120428","5.0","Awesome camera for a beginner!","This is my first DSLR camera and I'm very satisfied with the quickness of taking pictures. I can snap rapid shots to catch that one quick smile out of my daughter in action.""

No regrets and endless time for endless amazing pics through this amazing camera! It will last for a very long time as you grow in your art and skill!""
"20120425","5.0","Apples to Apples and not Apples to Oranges","I read reviews that call this a 'good little' camera.  Wrong! This is a full size camera.  I read that the kit lens were inferior.  Could be right if you compare it to a $2,000.00 lens.  The EF S lens is not a $2,000.00 lens but it does a great job for a 'kit' lens.  The plastic body seems to be an issue with certain reviewers.  The body looks the same as other DSLR's that I've seen in retail stores.  A cautious photographer is going to wear a neck strap anyway.  A rubber grip does not guarantee that you won't drop the camera.  My experience with the quality of the pictures is very good.  The colors pop, the images are crisp and clear, and the camera feels balanced.  I have owned a Nikon SLR film camera,and  a Pentax SLR film camera.  I never got the images from those cameras that I get form the T3. I suggest that you make a trip to your favoite retailer and see this in person.  I also Suggest that you do buy T3/1100 For Dummies from Amazon.  I am a not a professional(make a living from my photos).  If I were, then I would buy the top of the line camera body and top quality lenses. I am a hobby photograper with limited resources seeking a qualtiy camera.  The T3 is the right fit for me. (by the way the two names,T3 or 1100, depends on where the camera is sold.  In the US or overseas.)""
"20110901","4.0","Awesome SLR!","My first SLR. Pictures are great! Night and days comparing to 'superzoom' Panasonic FZ7, especially under low light conditions and indoors. Zoom pictures are much clearer also.Some not so great points ---the body looks cheap; handle is a bit slippery;--the flash is a bit hard to control; many settings it will popup automatically and cannot block it easily;--movie has only one HD mode, 1 minute uses >200 MB, holds about 15 minutes for a 4GB card. Wish it has more resolutions.Overall, for under $600 with 2 zoom lenses, this is awesome!!""
"20110829","5.0","Outstanding Deal","I must admit that the overall deal I received on this Canon EOS Rebel T3 kit was better than expected. The package deal with a Canon EF-S 55-250mm lens saved me over $200.00. The has operated flawlessly since charging. This camera is worth the price.""
"20110823","5.0","Great starter SLR!","We got this camera after several friends encouraged us to try it out. The camera is easy to use - we have no photography or any creative background. The pics come out awesome. The Auto mode is easy but we do use the others as well. The action mode has allowed us to get the perfect shot of our baby.I would definitely recommend this to anyone just starting out with an SLR.""
"20110822","5.0","Best value entry level DSLR","I bought this as a backup for my other camera. Together with the lens and printer promotions, this camera is extremely cheap.Image and build quality is expectedly not as high as the next level cameras' such as the T3i but perfectly acceptable.A few years ago, you'd have to pay 3 times as much for similar features and image quality in a digital camera. Can't complain.""
"20110807","4.0","Canon T3","I purchased this camera as an upgrade from my pocket camera(S90). It is my 1st DSLR and I am an amateur photographer. I have had good results in the month or so that I've used it. The kit lens(18-55) has yielded good results for portrait photos and subjects as far as about 10-15 ft. away. I am satisfied with its speed, image quality and flexibility in functions. I recommend this camera for any beginner in the DSLR world as a good value with excellent image quality.""
"20110802","5.0","Awesome camera with minor flaws","I'm new to the DSLR game so I can't tell you that this camera is better than one that's more expensive, but I will tell you, it takes awesome pictures when you get the settings right,I shoot in full auto mode along with manual to make sure I at-least get one good shot.This camera is definitively better than a point and shoot, I compared an image shot with the T3 and a image shot with a Canon Powershot 120is and the images were much better.The only thing I don't like about the camera is it doesn't have 1080p and you can't adjust most settings when you're in video mode which for me is a big let down.However I didn't buy the camera for the video I bought it to take pictures and it does that pretty well if you know how to use the manual settings. If you get things wrong there's always Adobe lightroom providing the images aren't to far gone.The view finder for me is a little bit on the small side and viewing the information in the view finder is difficult for me to view sometimes.I don't like how the battery and sd card slot are on the bottom, it makes it a pain when using a tripod. If you're card is full and you're using a tripod you have to unscrew it from the tripod and then take it out which sucks.The menu is semi informative for the noob shooter like me, when  you go into manual mode and you go to adjust a setting it tells you that if you increase a value or decrease a value what it will do for the picture.It comes with a 18-55mm kit lens,its ok for what it is just don't expect to zoom out very far the image quality with it is ok there's a little noise out low light levels but can be tweaked in adobe lightroom the good thing is that this camera is compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lenses so that's good.Overall despite the minor flaws this camera has I would recommend it for the person that doesn't have the cash to step up to the T3I personally I would of stepped up to the T3I if I had the money but at the time I didn't but i'm perfectly happy with this model, it takes great pictures and that's all I can really ask for so yes id recommend people to buy this camera.""
"20110801","5.0","Love this camera!!!","I purchased this camera days before our big trip to Yellowstone National Park.  I had a Cannon G6 but was looking for a new camera that would take amzazing pictures.  Based on other reviews on Amazon I got this camera and it did not dissapoint!!  This camera takes incredible pictures and I couln't have picked a better time to upgrade.  I have gotten so many compliments on my pictures since purchasing it.  Buy this camera, you will be glad you did!!!""
"20110728","5.0","Excellent SLR for amateur photographers!!!","I did a fair amount of research prior to ultimately deciding on the Canon EOS Rebel T3. I think this is a fantastic camera for those who are just starting to get into advanced digital photography (this is my first SLR so I really have nothing else to compare it to). Images are crisp and clean, taking in so much detail. The settings took me some time to learn to figure out what I wanted to use majority of the time but I'm sure that will apply to anyone who went from using a point and shoot to an SLR for the first time since the variety of settings expands greatly when you take this step (hence why I gave the intuitive control rating four stars instead of five).The biggest selling points for me on this camera were (compared to the Canon EOS Rebel XSi which is what I was originally going to get):- the fact that the 12.1 MP is better compatible with the 15-85 mm IS II lens that came with the camera rather than having a higher number of MP- weight is lighter possibly because the grip is not made of a leather type material but it is still very comfortable to use- price ($100 cheaper than the XSi)Word of advice when you buy a new SLR camera, also buy a cheap UV filter. That way if for some reason (hope it doesn't actually happen though) something hits your camera lens, it will hit the filter instead which is way cheaper to replace than an entire lens.I have only had this camera for about a month now but so far it has not disappointed me. The booklets that come with the camera package that explain how to take specific pictures are also tremendously helpful. As for cons, as this is my first SLR camera it's hard for me to say but maybe size? I have read reviews stating that this camera is bigger than the XSi but the fact that it is lighter leaned me towards buying the T3.""
"20110727","5.0","Simply a great SLR","The camera is fairly easy to use and light weight considering its size. Controls are easy to work with but definitely you will need to read the manual.  Picture quality is great and the Amazon.com has done it again.""
"20110723","4.0","I'd recommend this camera to DSLR newbies.","I bought this camera after extensive online research into what makes for a good entry-level DSLR. But, definitely, one of the biggest motivators for me was its price. You do get what you pay for with this camera and if you're new to the DSLR world, you'll be impressed by its ease of use, size and weight and simple functionality.I've been doing mostly portrait photography and the kit lens (18-55 IS II f/3.5-5.6) that came with the T3 performs very well. The images are sharp and to tell the truth, 12.2 MP was more than enough for me. I've ordered prints online and they look amazing.There are only two complaints I have about this camera. First, I was used to picking up higher end DSLRs and noticed the composition of the bodies was a lot more solid. The T3's body, at times, seems a little too plastic. Second, I would have loved for Canon to have placed a grip on the front part of the camera where one's hand is positioned near the shutter button.This camera will appeal to you if you want the speed, functionality and improved photographic capabilities of a DSLR but are not yet ready to go full speed and buy a higher-priced camera.""
"20110722","5.0","SO FAST!!!","I bought the Rebel t3 last minute for a couple trips my husband and I are going on this summer. I had been keeping an eye on prices on Rebels in general for the past year. While shopping around, I noticed this seller had a very competitive price! I bought it and contacted them to please ship it soon (I put expedited shipping on it). They said they had already sent it out and I had it in my hands in 24 hours! That's what 'fast' shipping means. Good job, guys!!!!!""
"20110717","5.0","A Great Entry Level DSLR With Tons of Features","Back in the mid 1980s, I purchased a Canon EOS 650 -- one of their first autofocus film cameras -- to use as my high school's yearbook editor and photographer. I absolutely loved the camera; my nephew recently inherited it, and he loves it as well. It took amazing pictures. Offered a plethora of features. And has lasted over 20 years.However, prior to purchasing the T3, I did my research regarding entry-level DSLR cameras, and had narrowed it down to the Nikon D3100 and the T3. Yes, the Nikon offers higher megapixels. Yes, the Nikon has better HD video modes. However, much wanting an e-reader for the specific purpose of reading books, I wanted a DSLR camera that would take amazing pictures -- not record state-of-the-art video. I have a video camera for that. (As an aside, I've shot some video with the T3, and the quality is fine for stuff like YouTube or personal blogs. If you're a user wanting more than that, I'm unsure why would would be using your DSLR for video in the first place.)I chose the T3. And could not be happier.Other things I like about the T3?1. Canon is known for outstanding image quality. Their CMOS sensor and DIGIC processor combine to produce some of the best (if not _the_ best) images in the industry.2. Canon lenses -- even the less expensive ones made for 'prosumers' (professional consumers who often don't spend more on a lens than the actual camera body itself cost) -- are extremely high quality.3. Speaking of lenses, great ones are also available from third-party vendors. In fact, I purchased a 50-200 zoom lens from Sigma, and it works perfectly with the T3. It was also quite a bit less expensive than the Canon alternative.4. Very lightweight. (I actually like the body construction and materials used.)5. Features? Tons. And the menu system is rather easy to navigate. Yes, I'm aware another reviewer has been rather negative regarding the Canon interface; however, do your research. Many DSLR users prefer the Canon menu system to those of other manufacturers. It can be confusing, but only if you are a complete novice to photography and know nothing about the actual art. If you want to turn a camera on and push a button or two, a DSLR is not what you need. If you want to have more control (complete control, even) over your results and are willing to take the time to learn the vocabulary and skills necessary, then you are ready for a DSLR.6. Detailed manual. Yes, it's long. Yes, it's detailed. But with so many features and combinations of settings, I'd much rather have detail versus 'the basics.' (Though there is a 'basics' version as well). The T3 is not a toy. It's a tool. As with any tool, you need to take the time to learn to use it effectively.7. 12.2 MP is an ideal amount for an entry-level DSLR and results in great detail. If you are wanting to enlarge your images to wall-mural size, you're better off using a film camera anyway.8. I'm content with the video features offered because I will rarely (if ever) use my DSLR for video recording. I have a dedicated digital-video camera for that. (Why wouldn't you?)""
"20110715","5.0","Keeps getting better...","This is my first DSLR camera.  I have shopped and shopped looking for one and even asked friends and professional photographers.

"20110714","5.0","perfect dslr for moms","i have the t3i and the t3. they are very similar and both do movies. t3i is def an upgrade but if you don't need those extra features i'd get the t3. i have the t3 for personal use just got it as an early bday present actually last week! fab pics. been using the t3i for work for a few months. i did some mega research about the best dslrs for hq video and stills (because we needed both for work but not at the mega pro level, just good enough for a quality showing in the video field for internet video (which it WAY exceeds) and also for photos for our magazine, website and social media. bought a few lights, wireless mic (which is a wonderful feature that the t3i has that the t3 does not- a mic input), tripod, etc and we have a great low cost setup with a professional quality without going overboard.now for my personal use - i wanted the quality stills and video but i didn't the the higher resolution or the mic input. so i got the much cheaper t3. they are very similar down the line minus these features and the rotating lcd on the t3i and grips on the body of the camera. photo quality is wonderful. can't wait to take it on future vacations... it is also wonderful being able to also capture everyday life with such quality vs my reg digital camera. i've been missing out for sure! we are going to take it up to the mountain for a fun family photo shoot soon too.so that's an endorsement from me for the t3 and t3i!""

Don't wish to spend forever understanding how to use all the great DSLR features then this is the camera for you. Only negative I have is I wish the T3 had rubber grip.. Still easy to hold steady with or without a long telephoto lens.""

I would recommend this camera to anyone just wanting to buy their first SLR camera.""
"20110704","5.0","A nearly perfect camera...BUT","Having grown up with film, it took me time to come to that paradigm shift necessary to make the move to digital.  Besides, I had a great deal of money invested in my old Canon Rebel camera and lenses.  Finally, I made the shift, and will never look back.  I needn't belabor the advantages of digital vs. film: by now, everybody must know those.  Let me add only my own pluses: this camera takes fabulous photos, and the picture is not dependent on a selected film.  I get rich, deep colors that I only got with film by serendipity.  I own a Kodak as well; just an inexpensive thing received as a gift.  But that camera is so slow that the final picture is milliseconds later than what you viewed: the dog has moved from that perfect pose by the time the photo is captured, for example.  This camera captures a photo so quickly that you get what you aimed for.  Plus, the inexpensive Kodak takes poor photos in low light.  I have taken pictures at night with the Canon, no flash (outdoors, for example) and get a flawless photo.  It has features that make even a novice (petit moi, for example) get great photos.Alas! one reason I purchased it as opposed to another was that it touted itself as being compatible with the expensive lenses I'd bought for my film Rebel.  It is not: those lenses work intermittently, when at all (I get 'cannot communicate with the lens' errors most of the time).  So I have to start saving money to purchase all new lenses (which actually add up to much more than the camera itself).  That hurts: a kilobuck is a lot of money.Nevertheless, I love this camera more than the older one and feel I made the best possible choice.""
"20110702","5.0","Great Camera","I was debating between this camera and the Canon t3i for quite some time. Although the t3i has 18 megapixels but the sensor for both of the cameras are the same so the extra megapixels aren't really that big of a difference. The image quality for the t3 is proven to be better than the t3i since the extra megapixels arent crammed into the image sensor. I love this camera, the pictures are great and the videos, although 720p, are more than enough for what I am going to do. I recommend this camera to everyone that asks about it.""

"20110608","5.0","Great first DSLR","Now, just want to say that this is my very first DSLR, but I absolutely love it. It was actually pretty easy to ease right out of the box. Very first thing I did was charge the battery fully and just went crazy with it for the next hour. Most of the shooting modes I had figure out pretty quickly. Putting it on full auto is very helpfull if you just don't feel like manually focussing the lens or turning on the flash and so on. Picture quality is awesome and same for the video. Video was actually one of the main reasons that I chose this SLR over others, because I wanted to get the 75-300mm lens as well. I looked at the Nikon D3100, D3000, the Canon Rebel EOS, the 10 MP models, but for the price and camera features, I found this to be the better deal for me. Going from a point and shoot to this SLR was a smooth transition, I still have my nikon L100, which has awesome image stabilization for video and pics, and the T3's VR is also damn good when using the stock lens that comes with it. But if you record video with the 75-300mm lens, the video will be shaky unless you use tripod or have a very steady hand. Using SD and SDHC cards is also a great convenience, the neck strap is pretty comfortable. I'm still going through the different settings for the modes to get the best picture possible. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a DSLR.""
"20110607","5.0","Great walk-around or travel DSLR","This is a great entry level DSLR.  I have shot all recent canon DSLRs (7D, 60D, T2i, T3i...) and I'm looking for a light travel/casual shooting camera to upgrade my XSI.  I thought the T3i was it, but after trying out this camera, I think this is the cam I was looking for.  Have the cam for a few days now.  The build quality is a little better than what I would expect from an entry level cam.  It's nice and light.  The menu is simple but still offers a lot of nice custom settings.One thing to keep in mind is that the low resolution LCD doesn't always tell the whole story.  My initial test photos look rather ordinary under this LCD.  However, when I view them in my desktop, they are a lot nicer.  In any case, that isn't a concern for me as the LCD is just for preview anyway.Color/saturation is spot on.  ISO performance is what surprised me.  I took a photo in 3200ISO, uploaded it to my website (unprocessed) and ask my photography-savvy friends to guess what ISO it was.  Most of them say 400 or 800, 2-3 stops off the mark.  It's so amazing, the stock lens is now totally usable indoor.Overall, I highly recommend this camera for first-time DSLR users or advance users who need a light walk-around or travel cam.""

I started loving this camera from the first day.It took awesome pictures.I had uploaded some pics in facebook and there were tons of likes.This camera is really worth the money.especially for beginners like me.""
"20110527","5.0","Great camera for first-time SLR owners","I had some doubts about this camera when I looked online, but when I handled it for the first time, I was very impressed. Since my photography focus is horses, it was important to me to have a camera with no shutter lag and instantaneous recovery time between shots, which the T3 has.I also purchased a 55-250 IS zoom lens, a UV filter to protect the lens, and a class 10 Sandisk Extreme SD card. They have worked very well together and I haven't experienced any problems. The kit lens has enough zoom for most indoor shots, but outside, I nearly always use the 55-250 zoom lens instead.The battery life is great. I can take several extensive photoshoots before having to charge the battery. I use the manual settings more than the auto settings because I can set the AF points for more creative shots. The photo quality is great and images are sharp with good color (assuming you focused properly. :) )The video quality is very good at its original size but decreases significantly when displayed on a larger screen. One drawback is that once the recording is started, you can't zoom or change the focus. But it does have audio - although of medium quality.The onscreen interface was really helpful for me as an SLR newbie because each setting is briefly explained on the screen when settings are changed. The kit manuals are helpful and explained everything I needed to get started. I miss the textured grip, but find the smooth rubber easy to clean when I get dirty hands with the horses. The battery and card slots are on the bottom of the camera which means you can't set it down while it is open, but that's a relatively small issue.Overall, I've been extremely satisfied with the Canon Rebel T3 and would recommend it for first-time SLR owners like me.""
"20110525","4.0","A great little DSLR worth your consideration.","You will probably read a lot of reviews of this camera that are rather dismissive of its look, feel, and feature set. And while I cannot defend the lack of a rubberized handgrip... spend any amount of time with this camera and you will find it simple, yet competent little DSLR which gets the most important thing right.The camera has a glossy plastic finish which doesn't exactly exude quality or make it feel like a high-end camera. But construction on this camera is very tight. The plastic is light-weight but its not flimsy like you would expect. There is no rubberized handgrip, which I think was a mistake to omit this on this camera. Especially since its predecessor (and its competitors) have them. Outside of that, the hand grip is a very nice size. The one upshot to the lightweight plastic is that the camera feel very light with the kit lens attached.One thing you have to watch out for is that the camera feels very out of balance when attaching a heavier lens. The Canon EF-S 18-200, while a good performer optically when paired with the T3, feels way too front heavy. And this will be true with a lot of the pro-grade Canon lenses that you attach to the T3.The buttons and menu system have the typical degree of straight-forwardness found in most Canons. Canon's menu system is easy to learn and navigate through. That makes the T3 a good candidate for a student or someone that wants to learn photography in general and wants a camera they can grow with. Of course it offers full Auto mode but when you're ready to try and manipulate the more advanced manual controls, the Canon Rebel T3 is about as unintimidating as they come. It's also a great entry into the DSLR realm for hobbyists currently using an advanced point and shoot (and can be found for almost the same price as some advanced point and shoots).With the exception of burst shooting, this camera's performance is excellent. Excellent start-up, shot-to-shot, and autofocus performance. It has 9 autofocus points compared to its predecessor's 7 points. I do not reccommend this camera as a budget action shooter. It has a slow continuous burst rate (2.7fps) and a very limited buffer. If you need a budget action shooting DSLR, your best bet is the Pentax K-r.The camera comes with a nice, chunky battery which delivers excellent battery life. The viewfinder is 95% coverage and I found it to be satisfactory, some people say its really cramped but personally I think it's alright. The screen resolution is rather low at 230k, but in real-world use it's not as bad as you would think, and somewhat viewable in direct sunlight. I think both the viewfinder and the LCD are of better quality than the ones found on the Nikon D3100. And overall, the T3 is faster and more fluid than the D3100. After having shot with both cameras, I personally think the T3 is more enjoyable to shoot with... despite the D3100's better plastic and more advanced spec sheet.The camera ships with the standard 18-55 kit lens but I suggest buying the kit which includes the additional 55-250 lens. While I do not like the kit lens performance when paired with the Rebel T2i & Rebel T3i, I think when it's paired with the T3 it's a bit of a different story. The lower end kit lenses have an easier time resolving detail on the T3's 12 megapixel sensor vs. the 18 megapixel sensor on the T2i/T3i. So, do not let a salesperson or anybody else say that the image quality on this camera is inferior solely on the basis that it has a lower megapixel count than its linemates. However, when you put a higher-end lens on the T2i/T3i, they do trounce the T3 when it comes to resoliving detail (not in noise performance though).That said, overall, the image quality is excellent. Detail capture is good, metering is excellent, exposure is excellent, dynamic range is pretty good, color reproduction is punchy without being cartoonish and oversaturated. The ISO performance is excellent. Excellent performance up to and including ISO1600. One minor quibble is that the JPEGS come out just a tad soft. But they respond well to a little bit of in-camera sharpening or of course you can shoot in RAW as well. But overall, a very impressive performance from the T3.The movie mode, while delivering solid video quality, is rather limited. It's 1280x720 HD and there are very limited manual controls. It's more like something you would use for quick clips rather than longer videos or movies. I think the Rebel T2i/T3i or EOS 60d are better choices if you're equal parts into videos and photos as they have far better video modes than the T3 does. But if you're main interest is stills photography, this probably won't matter much to you.The Rebel T3 may not be the sexiest camera around but it is a simple, enjoyable camera to shoot with that delivers nice results with minimum effort and it appeals to a broad range of folks from DSLR newbies, to hobbyist, to even professionals looking for a light-weight backup to their higher end gear. At its current price, it is a great value and I highly reccomend it.""

Or....if someone has other suggestions I'm listening....thanks!""
"20110417","5.0","Great camera!","For the price of the camera, you wouldn't really expect much. However, that is completely false. For the small price, this camera really packs a big punch. It was a no-brainer for me to choose Canon for my first DSLR. Every single camera I've ever owned is a Canon, and I've never been disappointed. This camera is great for the beginner photographer, and even for the more advanced photographer. It's a breeze to learn how to work all of it's functions and most importantly, it delivers such amazing quality photos. The kit comes with a 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 image stabilization lens. Even with a moderately wide aperture, the lens performs exceptionally well under low-light situations. I will eventually grow out of this lens, but for now it's doing well for me. I feel like as I grow in my photography, this camera will grow with me and last me years to come. One of my goals is to become a freelance photographer. I have many many years before I get to that point, but right now, this is a good starting point.""

The presets are fantastic but am also looking forward to learning all the features that are available on this camera.  The only negative I've found so far it that the camera can get heavy when wearing around my neck for an extended period of time.  I many need to find another solution for carrying it around.But the bottom line is that I'm very pleased with this camera.  It is all that I wanted it to be.""

"20110408","5.0","Love it!","I purchased this camera a few days ago and I've had nothing but FUN with it!  Aside from my simple Kodak Easyshare point and shoot, I had a Canon EOS Elan 7 (35mm) and had been wanting to switch it over to Digital for several years.  The longer I waited, the better the camera's got and more affordable they became.I decided on the Canon T3 mostly because of the affordable price. (Nearly 1/2 of the T3i)  I felt like I was getting a very good value for my money.  I was right!This camera takes amazing photo's! Clear, crisp, true color.It's very easy to use, right out of the box.Fit's all my old lenses and the remote from the Elan 7All the advanced manual settings I could want topped with the instant gratification of seeing how the settings affect the picture instantly.This camera allows you to use live screen shooting which so many people like these days and it takes HD video.The 12 megapixels is plenty even when enlarging OVER 11 x 14'.For a lower end Canon DSLR, it's a huge value for the money.  This camera is an excellent choice for the hobbiest/enthusiast.I am SOO glad I purchased it!Nakiska""

I have been using digital cameras my whole life, but I am already starting to figure out the T3. The pictures are incredibly crisp and it works alright with zoom as well (using the included lens). I love the creative auto setting (CA). The only downfall is the fact that if it has a way to crop photos ON the camera, I haven't found it yet. Other than that, I'm in love!""

I have owned it for about a week now and have taken it everywhere. I've heard complaints about the battery, however, I've found the battery to last quite a while.

I just transitioned from a point and shoot to this one because I have a baby and I wanted to get better pictures for scrapbooking and also to display around my house. My dad is a photographer so it wasn't that hard to learn how to use one of this cameras, but dad wasn't always around me so I have to figure out a couple things about light exposure, speed and all that.  Overall, the camera has been working fine for me. Maybe when I get more knowledge about how to play with exposure and all that I might transition to a better one, but for now so far so good and I like the brand too.""
"20120413","5.0","Great camera","I did a ton of research in buying this camera for my wife for a gift.  She loves it.  She is taking photography classes with it right now.  It takes great pictures in the basic auto mode but has a ton of other features once you learn them.  She hasn't used much of the video features so I can't comment on them.  Her initial main use was trying to capture photographs of our children which we could never get with a point and shoot since they are too fast.  It works great for that but has so many other features she has now become more interested in photography.  Overall, great camera for a great price.""

"20120407","5.0","Excellent Camera - Video Just Okay","Camera is exactly as advertised.  One item on taking video.  It takes great video, but you basically have to use the manual focus while video-ing.  Not the easiest when chasing a toddler around, but it works.  I looked at other DSLR cameras that have continuous auto focus, but they tend to have a hard time figuring out what to focus on.  Basically after hours of research I realized you have to choose your poison on the video side for lower end DSLRs.  Either an auto focus that searches and is noisy or a manual focus which is only as good as the user :)We mainly bought this camera (upgrading from point and shoot) for pictures and for the price this camera takes amazing pictures.  Also the shutter lag is virtually zero which is another great thing when you have kids. The video is also pretty good once you get the hang of it.""
"20120407","5.0","You Can't Go Wrong With This Camera","I was looking at purchasing the T2i, as it could do 18 megapixels. Why? Would I really need to be concerned about the megapixels at the highest level. I am currently shooting with a Canon 300D, which goes way back in time, but still takes good pictures. I has a whole 6 megapixels. The Canon T3 gives me TWICE that of what I have currently. The T2i would have given me THREE TIMES the megapixels. I decided that it was not necessary for my standard picture shooting, and was over-kill for my needs. As for the 1080p video, versus the 720p on the T3, that also is fine, as I really do not intend on using the camera for shooting video. For those intending to use this as a primary video taker, they may be interested in the articulating screen that the T3i has.  I have a camcorder, which shoots in HD, @1080p, that fits in my pocket--very portable. As for the screen, on the T2i, which some professionals were all hyped up about, I don't care that the resolution is higher on the screen. I review pictures on my computer, not on the camera. I have also found that I want to see a full sized picture, on my monitor, not a shrunken midget, on a tiny screen. I will occassionally do a quick review of a picture, just to make sure that I got what I wanted in the frame, but that is it. The end result being that the screen on the T3 is just fine for me. Now for the rest of the features, I compared the T3, T3i, and T2i, on the Canon site, and there is otherwise only a fraction of a difference between them. The difference was not enough for me to fell that I would be missing something, by buying the T3. For the extra money that the T2i costs, I bought a 50mm, f/2.5 lens for my new camera (well, I had to chip in a few more bucks! I also had to battle other would-be buyers on Ebay to get it!). I stuck with the Canon line, as having had my 300D for years, it has served me well (and yes, I plan on keeping it, as a back-up). The lens will work on the T3, as they would have also worked on the T2i, or the T3i. Basically the T3 gave me the majority of the features incorporated into the T2i, and T3i, that I actually needed. I was not intereste in spending the extra money for the 'fluff'.""

"20120325","5.0","Best Amateur Purchase EVER!","I don't know the first thing about SLR cameras, but I knew that the Fuji Finepix S2000 (SLR like) and the Sony Cybershot (great camera, but...) I've been using were not getting the job done.  My son is 5 and he's in basketball and tee ball and he'll be starting school soon and I needed a camera that I could rely on to take awesome pictures.  Well, after reading several reviews I went to the exchange today and purchased this camera.  I brought it home and charged the battery while I read the manual a little and installed the software from the included disks.  Well, as soon as that light turned green, I popped the battery and a memory card into the camera, turned it on using the sports setting and went outside to take pictures of my husband and son playing basketball.  WOW! WOW! WOW!  OMG that's all I can say!  NO BLUR AT ALL IN THE ACTION SHOTS!!!!!!!  That's all I wanted.  I could have purchased another 'bridge' camera, you know the SLR like point and shoot cameras, but I went with this one because it was only $60 more and I thought if I liked it, then I can get better acquainted with the functions and maybe get different lenses and accessories later on.  I'm so glad I decided on the T3.  I looked hard at the T3i, mostly because of that moveable LCD display, but the price was right on the T3.  Oh, and I know that this may make me sound dumb, but I had no idea that this camera has a built in flash.  It has the slide on top where you would slide in a flash piece, but little did I know that there was one built in.  If that was mentioned in the specifics online, I totally missed it.  Anyway, I was taking some pictures inside and when I pushed the button to take a picture, the flash popped up right away and I got a great photo!  I haven't had to think about a thing thus far except when I set the date and time when I first turned the camera on and when trying to figure out how to get the live view on the display screen.  BELIEVE me, if you're thinking about buying this camera and you're not a professional but would like to take great photos, stop thinkging and just buy it.  You won't be disappointed.  I've been through so many cameras that I could have just bought the T3i outright.  I'm sure I'll keep my cybershot for spur of the moment things since it's small and more portable.  But for capturing my son's sports and outdoor action memories, I'll be reaching for my T3 ALWAYS!""

"20120316","3.0","A DSLR for the P&S crowd moving up...","Nothing wrong with moving up.  But the build quality and features are worth about three stars.  In the store, this feels cheap.  Pics are better than P&S pics, so most give this five stars (due to the MUCH larger sensor in this compared to almost any P&S; the same is true for all DSRs).  I'd advise getting a Canon T3i or T2i if you can stretch a bit.  Feels better in the hand, more capabilities, better build quality (e.g., articulating, high res LCD), better features.  For other new DSLR users, try the Nikon D3100 if you prefer which comes with a pretty good kit lens and is better built than the T3 --- do not get the Nikon D3000 which is cheaper but uses old tech and is not worth its cheap price.  An idea is to skip the T3 with the Canon kit lens (if one still wants this camera) and get the Canon 50mm/1.8 for nicer pics and probably at a cheaper (or similar) price.This DSLR is like a starter DSLR or starter motorcycle or starter house --- you'll probably want a better one soon enough and can save money by buying it now for not much more.

Later I discovered that to take pictures quickly you have to use the view finder and not the screen.  Sometimes I can't get the camera to take a picture and then all of the sudden it will start working. Problem is that I don't know for sure if it is user error or the camera not working properly.  I will have to take it to someone to find out. Spending this much for a camera I want it to be easy.

"20120312","4.0","Canon EOS Rebel T3: Awesome entry-level DSLR","The compulsive buyer in me drew my attention to this DSLR because of the awesome price it had early January 2012. I was going on a 3 week vacation and decided I wanted to take higher quality pictures of my trip and upgrade from a digital point and shoot to an entry level DSLR.I would highly recommend this camera for those NEW to DSLR photography. I have had an awesome time using it during the last 2 1/2 months and take it with me everywhere. I picked up the Canon EFS 55-250mm lens to enable capture from longer distance as the kit lens only goes up to 55mm.I just picked up the Canon 50mm 1.8, along with a Sigma filter and a fotodiox hood to add to my arsenal and looking forward to playing with that in a couple of days.Pros:The price is great for what you are getting. If I had the extra dough, I would have went with the T3i. However, since this is my first DSLR and I am planning on selling this when I ACTUALLY know what I really want from an SLR, I went with this model to get me started.Cons:I think the kit lens is only OK. If you want to spare some $$, only get the body, and order the 50mm 1.8 (I will confirm how this performs with the T3 once I get time to play with it).You will be missing some functions found in higher models such as an IR receiver. I also don't have S1, S2 modes which would've been nice for easier set up with slave flashes.Another feature I would've loved, is the self-cleaning mirror. I still have to figure out how to clean it myself or just take it in for service to a professional, and I would prefer to do it myself.The body is light compared to higher models of course but really, it is well built and GOOD ENOUGH. Just take care of your camera and it should last a very long time (crossing fingers)This is one of my first reviews and again this is coming from someone who has only been into this for the past couple of months. However, I have taken over 10,000 photos and have been very happy with my results. After a year or two, I plan on upgrading to a higher model canon. During the next couple of years however, I plan on investing in the higher model lenses to give me better photos. Hopefully by learning on a lower model body, it will be an awesome feeling when I finally get that Canon that will cost 3 times as much as this one.Bottom line: Highly recommended for those looking to get started with DSLR photography and are on a budget. However if you have that extra $300 to spend to get a step or two higher models, I'd say go for it and you will probably not want to upgrade ever since you will have most of the features you could ever want. Then again I am starting to realize this is an addictive hobby and better gear really does mean better results. However, I'm sure there are pros out there that can get awesome shots with this alone.. Thanks for listening!""

I really enjoy this camera, it is simple to use and will produce great pictures in auto mode.  If you want to have more fun, become familiar with the creative modes (it can be confusing to keep straight at first, but just keep practicing!).  One point of caution, you will want to spend more money!  As you become better at taking pictures, you'll want to add things like new lenses, flashes, tripod, color gels, the list goes on and on.

I would recommend this camera to anybody that is just starting to use SLR cameras. The only thing is it is not quiet. It is quiet for normal times, but not for places that you must be extremely quiet. It is still a great camera with an unbeatable price!""

"20120227","4.0","Love picture quality but don't expect fast picture taking.","I may not know all of the functions yet, but I love the picture quality that this camera has. My fifteen year old daughter took it out in the snow and captured some studio quality shots of her older sister. It took some adjusting indoors to get pictures of inside sporting events. The shutter is not quick to respond in the auto position when indoors. The camera takes and incredibly long time trying to focus before it will snap a picture if it does at all. Using the camera in the av or tv mode while snapping inside pictures helped some. It takes nice pictures at a distance with the 200mm telephoto lens which I purchased separately, but that is a bit cumbersome for on the fly shots. I love the quality but haven't figured out all the settings that work best for quick action shots from a distance indoors. Even using the sports/action setting did not help. I also adjusted the ISO, but I will continue playing with it because I love the quality of the photos, and this is my first digital slr.""
"20120223","5.0","Very happy with this camera.","While I enjoy taking pictures I am not a professional photographer.However I am an artist who makes glass art/jewelry and then I sell it online.Straight out the box I was able to get pictures of my stuff that are just fantastic.WAY beyond my 14.7MP non-DSLR!I bought some upgrade lenses but you really don't need anything extra to get great shots.I know value and for my money this at $499 is bang for the buck.""
"20120222","5.0","Perfect upgrade","My wife and I have been reviewing DSLR's for a couple months now, and as far as bang for the buck goes, this camera does it all.  It is a big upgrade from a regular point and shoot and has full range of adjustments.  Sure, there are probably better ones out there, but this one does everything you need it to do, and then some.""
"20120221","5.0","Beginner but Thrilled","Ok,so I bought this camera because I was not liking the results of any other point and shoot camera I previously purchased to capture photos of my kids. (5 and 3) Both of them REFUSE to stand still or look at me to be photographed. For the last year I have been using my iPhone which of course does not have flash, and subsequently, I could not take pics in poorly lit environments. So I finally shelled out for this camera.This is day 1, but so far I LOVE IT! I have taken hundreds of just random shots so far of them running and jumping, ignoring me, making faces, photos of the dog, and even pictures of my husband being a clown.I don't know much about the 'technicalities' but as a beginner, this camera is easy to use and captures beautiful shots!""
"20120220","4.0","Great for us beginners!","The T3 is a wonderful little camera.  I am just learning about the world of DSLR photography and this camera is really easy to use.  I've had it for about 7 months and I can now competently shoot in manual mode.  I get a lot of compliments on my photos and facebook friends asking 'what kind of camera do you have!?'  I'm always sure to tell them I have the bargain canon rebel. If you're a student just learning about photography I highly recommend this camera.  I'm hoping to upgrade soon to a 7D but I will keep this little gem for an easily accesible camera that doesn't take up a lot of space but can produce some wonderful images.""

They have fast shipping, I ordered it and it came within 2 days. They even included a lens dust blower, an 8gb memory card, and a camera bag. This is a great bundle deal.""
"20120219","5.0","what can I say that was not said before ? - this is a great camera at a great price","Its a wonderful camera, I was debating whether to get the Rebel T2i or this one and decided on this because of the weight and the deal it was on. I could not be happier with this camera. I assume if you care about rapid RAW format shooting this is not for you but as someone who tends to shoot JPEG mainly I have this camera to be a perfect fit. the grip is very good and I don't feel a lack of the rubberized grip of the higher 'i' series. taking multiple short concurrently (I normally take 3-4 in succession to choose the best) is easy, responsiveness with and without flash is great, battery life cannot is unequaled by anything I used before. in short - very close to perfect and the price/performance really cannot be beat. Coupled with the Caselogic slingshot bag I got that holds both lenses, the extra battery and extra memory stick + sensor cleaning kit and wallet this makes for an extremely easy to carry around camera kit. I couldn't be happier with my purchase""

"20120206","5.0","great dsrl starter camera","I purchased the Canon EOS Rebel DSLR camera a month ago and I absolutely love it. I read all reviews on a few dslr's and finally made my decision and I have no doubt that I made the right decision. The main reason I wanted this camera was to take sporting pictures of my cousins kids, I needed something that wouldn't blur where its not perfect its 10 x's better than my old digital camera. The lighting has alot to do with it. I have noticed that if the lighting is not good then don't use the sports setting, use the manual setting it uses the flash and takes good pictures. Non sports pictures I have taken have been awesome, the pictures are so fine, shiny and life like. I have not purchased the additional lens yet, right now its not needed. I charged the battery in only 2 hours and it lasted 3 weeks. I highly recommend this camera.""

"20120205","5.0","Excellent piece of work","I wanted a fairly high quality DSLR that wouldn't clean out my bank account. I checked out two similarly priced cameras -- the Canon and a Nikon. Both have high name regonition, and I feel like the Nikon is probably a good camera; but, based on the Amazon reviews and the price, I chose the Canon - my first DSLR. I am delighted with the choice. It seems very high quality and well constructed, with a substantial set of useful features. I've had it over a month, have taken hundreds of shots, spent a substantial amount of time with the manuals, and still haven't dived into all of the functions. What I have used works superbly! The menus and controls are solid (once you learn the conventions - which is a fairly simple task) and access to the functions seems easy. I guess it would't hurt to mention that it takes excellent pictures. You get a choice of the RAW format or several qualities of JPEG or both at the same time. Several reviews mentioned it was a good starter camera for those moving from other sorts of cameras to a DSLR, but I feel certain it will take me quite some time to grow out of this one.""

I was a little afraid to spend the money on an expensive camera( at least expensive for me),but I'm glad I did.  This camera is so easy to use and it takes great pictures.  I have taken pictures from a distance and gotten home, zoomed in on a subject in the picture cropped out the rest and the quality of the print was wonderful.  Can't complain about anything so far.

When I received it, I was so impressed with it, I have never worked with a better camera. I am in video production, and the video on this camera is amazing. Wonderful camera!

"20120128","5.0","Outstanding Camera for the Price","The various other reviews highlight the benefits of this camera, so I won't repeat them all. I will just say that I agree this is an great camera for the price. I recently took a picture of my daughter from 10 feet away using an inexpensive 50mm lens. It was possible to zoom in on her eye in the photo and see me sitting on the floor taking the picture (granted it was quite pixelated at that zoom level, but still...). The settings on the camera are also easier to use than those on my old 12.2 MP Canon point and shoot. I am really happy with how the movies turn out as well.The one and only drawback I have found with this camera is that the auto focus is VERY slow when using the LCD to frame a shot. For this reason, I only use the viewfinder now when taking pictures. I get the impression that the LCD view is designed mostly for making movies and not for picture taking.""
"20120127","2.0","The Rebel's (extra) LOUD Clicks!","I'm a Sr. citizen and have had many fine cameras in my life. When I got the Canon EOS Rebel T3 took my first pix, there is a loud sort of metallic click. It sounds like a camera built years ago when such things were just invented. Is THIS loud click normal, or is my Canon EOS Rebel a misfit and should be returned or replaced? I'd really like some feedback on this.""
"20120127","4.0","I know I love it.","I got the Canon EOS Rebel T3 12.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm IS II Lens + Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens back in September. Its my first DSLR. I have used Sony since 2005 and have been using the Sony H-5 and the Sony HX100v. I have to say it was a learning curve switching over to the Canon but a short one as I got David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography book. This truly helped me a lot with the T3.My only recommendation would be to get the package with the 55-250mm tele lens that has IS ( image stabilization) on it. My 75-300mm that came with the package I ordered did not have image stabilization so much of the time I have to use my tripod for distance shots. The 18-55mm lens did come with 'IS' so that was a plus, I only wish I would have really looked over what I was getting before making my decision. The cost difference is minimal. Now I am saving up to get a 55-250mm IS lens.And think about getting an AC adaptor, this comes in handy when you don't want to run your batteries down.But I will say, I adore the battery life, talk about long life. And the view finder, its outstanding on this camera. On my Sony HX100, it was awful. There are times when you need to use the VF vs the live view screen. Especially when you are in sunny condition, this VF on the Canon is tops.I think for the beginner to the world of DSLR you cant go wrong. I know of some photographers who have this T3 body and have upgraded their lens to much nicer than the kit lens. They say the T3 body is perfect. I am still learning, but from what I have been doing, I love it.  I have been shooting some close up shots of bugs, bees, lichen, moss and tiny 1/4' in diameter orange pinwheel mushrooms with the 18-55mm and getting some amazing shots. Loads of detail.I am very pleased with this camera.""

"20120123","5.0","love the EOS Rebel T3","I received this camera with a telephoto lens for Christmas.  I really enjoy the info screens that come up with each different mode.  It has made my taking pictures at horse shows easier.  My previous camera was stolen a couple of months ago and I had always struggled getting the right setting with the right lighting with indoor arenas and covered arenas with backlighting.  The camera gave me information that I used to experiment until I found the right settings to stop the action of the horses jumping over fences without all of the blurring motion.  I even switched to the video mode and shot their courses with the video.  My down side was getting the focus just right in the video mode.  I had 2 videos that came out and 1 that I stuggled with the focus.  All of the kids that I was with enjoyed the pics and video to study their performances.  Another thing that I liked about the camera is the weight.  This camera and lens is much lighter than my previous camera.  I started using the autofocus more on this camera than I had on my previous due to the quickness of the focusing.  I was able to go from each jump to the next and get the camera to focus quickly.  Someone else at our barn had received a different Canon EOS (not the T3) and she didn't know which settings to use to achieve the same photos that I was getting.  I was able to help her set up her camera so that she was able to get the same quality as I was getting.The quick screens help, especially for those of us that don't have the patience to 'read the manual.'  I want to take the camera and experiment with it until I get the desired results.""
"20120123","5.0","Amazing Camcorder, If I could rate it 6 stars I would","I was wondering if I should get the T3 or T3i, I decided I didn't need billboard quality and didn't take a whole lot of video from the camera since I also have a Canon Camcorder so I decided to get a T3 and boy am I glad.  My buddy has a T3i and we compared them...NO DIFFERENCE, other than slightly more megapixels on his but that only means you can zoom into somoene's nose hair instead of their nose when editing and I don't really need that.  I use it about 3 or 4 times a week. I will try and get some pics up from it.  This camera does phenomenal at night which is always everyone's worry. The controls are simple although Creative Auto Confused me a little bit at first but if you hit the 'Q' button towards the top right side of the LCD screen you can change settings, with regards to that I usually Keep It in 'Vivid', 'Intense' or 'warm' for deep colors.  I took pictures in cloudy weather in 'Vivid' and 'Warm' and it looks like a nice sunny day. the ONLY problem I have is I did try the video feature and the videos cam out malfunctioning but it may also be my computer because they are fine when I view them on the camera.  I strongly recommend this to anyone that is transitioning from point & Shoot or beginning a photography career.  I also recommend this to Hobbiest photographers that do photography in their spare time like me.""
"20120123","5.0","Good camera, especially for a beginner","I really like how simple this camera is to use, and this model was a real good value because some newer versions have come out.  I'm not sure what the newer versions do better but this camera is such a vast improvement over point and click cameras that I previously used.  I've got a 6 year old and an 8 year old and I can now get pictures that aren't blurry or a split second too late.  I can take 3-4 shots within 5 seconds so that I don't have to try and be perfect with my timing.  The zoom lense has been really great for sports shots or shots from over 20 feet away.  It's easy to switch out.  I'm told it takes very good video as well although I haven't tried it out yet.  Battery life has been great.  I got a basic 8 GB card and it has been fine.  Amazon had the best price and clearly spelled out that the zoom lens was the Canon brand lens (other discount sites were vague).""
