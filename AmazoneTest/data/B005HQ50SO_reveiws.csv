"20120604","5.0","For quality and features, this is a surefire winner!","Pros: Zoom range and maximum zoom image quality are superb.Full manual over-ride, and lots of user-adjustable programs make this appeal to experienced photographers, while the results from fully automatic settings are high quality. Great quality movies!Cons: Macro is good but not stunning - but macro lenses can be added if that's your thing, using the 52mm screw mount.I did a couple of weeks research before taking the plunge with this camera, and I am not in any way disappointed with my decision. Over the past 30 years, I've used the very top Nikon SLRs (35mm film), and for work, I've always gone with the mid-range Olympus compacts, most recently using the excellent Olympus C-5060. I decided I wanted greater zoom range and higher quality video than the C-5060 could offer, both for my consulting work and for home/recreational/travel use, but didn't want the weight and bulk that are the downsides of DSLRs.The Lumix FZ150K has exceeded my expectations; Image quality - even at maximum zoom and handheld - is amazing for a non-SLR, and only under considerable enlargement is processing/loss of detail evident. Video performance is top notch, easily matching my Sony mini-DVR camcorder.The FZ150K is extremely easy to use, with good ergonomics (at least for me), although some users with large fingers may find the buttons a bit fiddly at first - like any camera, you have to use it to become used to it - that's when you can start concentrating on the image, not on the machine you use to record it!This weekend I have been photographing birds around our property, and also taking night shots, and my friends are amazed by the great images I easily managed to obtain, thanks to the camera's quality Leica lens and useful settings. This Lumix brings the FUN back to taking photos! The picture burst modes are astonishingly good - because Panasonic have managed to design an autofocus system that is blindingly fast. Allied to this is the highly effective image stabilization, and the result is that duff shots are very rare. I took maybe 350 photos on the first day, and discarded about 6-8 due to blur. The rest were in focus, and nicely exposed. Taking pictures of a backlit feeder with some finches on it simply required adjusting the exposure using the rotary dial above the display screen - easy and intuitive. That's what makes the camera so quick to get used to. Add to its excellent ergonomics unusual features like 220fps high-speed movie setting for slo-mo playback, and good stereo sound with a highly effective wind-noise filter, and you have a camera that really does manage to deliver in every department.I would certainly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a very good point and shoot, but it is also worth considering against DSLRs by Canon, Nikon, Olympus and the like. Well worth checking this one out. An easy 5-stars.""
"20120530","5.0","fantastic bridge camera","I own Canon 40D with few L lenses, Pentax K200D (no longer manufactured but also very good DSLR) and Nikon P300 P&S camera. I have been searching for something smaller/lighter than Canon and Pentax but at the same time with longer zoom than 4X of Nikon P300...boy was it long search. I went through number of Sony, Olumpus, Fuji, none of them was a keeper for me (especially sony). During my search for that 'one' i kept coming back and looking at this FZ150 but price of it ($500.00) was just bit high for me...then there it was..$449 so i went for it...no regrets whatsoever, fantastic camera with very good camcorder future (always great to have even though some say its camera not camcorder i know...I own Panasonic HDC SDT750 camcorder).If you're debating on getting it or not, just get it and I don't think You will be disappointed.Great job Panasonic.""

"20120526","5.0","Perfect!","Performs well with just about everything I've thrown at it!  Takes amazing indoor pictures even in low-light situations (without using a flash).  I was torn between this camera and the Nikon One, but I'm VERY happy with my decision to go with Panasonic instead.  For the price of the Nikon 1 as well as the investment you would need in extra lenses, the Panasonic is the best bang for your buck.Pros:- Fairly easy to navigate controls right out of the box- Performs well in low-light even without the flash- Amazing focus- Ability to add extra lenses or filters if desired- Swivel display screen is great for those tricky shots or group portraits- Option to use a different flash with built-in hot shoe- Creative Control settings as well as pick up and go standard settings- Zoom works great, and you don't have to lug around large (& expensive) extra lensesCons:- Indoor video records a little too dark, even with several light sources""
"20120524","5.0","Best Camera For The Price","I bought the camera as a backup but it has become my 'go to camera' for all situations.  It takes great images at higher ISO (800+), low light like buildings at night, and continue to be amazed at its excellent sharpness.  I have owned a number of digital cameras including 2 DSLR's and this is by far the best camera.  I use the unit for Wildlife, Birds, and Wildflowers and just about everything else.  For those who do not want to learn camera controls it has Intelligent Auto Exposure where the camera makes all the settings and the user literally just pushes the shutter button to finalize the focus and record the image.It takes fantastic images in low light situations as well.  Lastly, the auto focus is better than most but like all auto focus systems still gets stumped in bright/contrasty lighting.Recently have convinced three individuals to purchase their own camera by sharing images made with the Panasonic DMC FZ150.  They are all very happy with their purchases.""
"20120523","5.0","Panasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24X Optical Zoom","This camera was difficult to find when I ordered it.It has 24X optical Zoom, which was smaller than other cameras.  After using it, the Zoom range is just right.  At full range it shows how sensitive it is to motion.  The pictures came out ok, but any more Zoom would result in a less sharp picture without a ridged tripod.The camera is supposed to have an electronic stabilizer, but I cannot be sure it would over-come too much motion while taking a photo.  I didn't have any problem using 24X or less Zoom.The wide angle is very nice to have.  Most of the cameras I tried had less wide angle than this one.I really like having an adjustable optical view finder.  It helps stabilize the camera because it is held close to my body as opposed to trying to take a photo with hands holding the camera away from my body.The optical view finder seems to display a 100%  image size so there is no difference between what you see and what you get.My only complaint is that the  viewer brightness seems to be dim in many cases.""
"20120523","5.0","What a Great Camera","This is our third Lumix product.  My wife has one, and I replaced an older model which I was using with this one.  We travel abroad a great deal, shooting a wide variety of subjects both inside and outside.  This camera has performed flawlessly...it will be in my kit bag for a long time.""
"20120520","5.0","Simply the best Bridge Camera on the Market","For the past 9 months I've been looking for a digital camera to handle video action sports as well as provide stunning still pictures. For the last 3 months I was torn between the Canon SX40HS, Sony HX200V, Fuji S4500, and Nikon P500. The decision came down to, a) which camera minimized or avoided the 'jello affect' common in most CMOS based sensor cameras, b) and which camera eliminated the 'blue streak' problem famous with most digital camera when shooting video near a light source. The only CMOS sensor camera under $1,000 to pass these 2 remaining hurdles was the Panasonic DMC-FZ150K. After a month of having this camera, my buddies with Canon and Nikon $2,000+ setups are astounded by the pictures this sub $500 camera produces and rivals some of their work. It's no wonder this camera is on back-order almost everywhere else except Amazon.""
"20111211","5.0","A LOT BETTER THAN I EXPECTED","Looking for a camera on Amazon isn't easy. However, if you want to buy a very good camera for less than $500 this is it, do not look any further. Super clear images whether it is close up or far. This is my first camera that cost more than $200 bucks, so compared to those, this one is like a huge upgrade. With those $200 toys, I would have to spend countless hours on photoshop to make the image look better. But, with this camera, no more photoshop. Pretty decent camera for the price you pay, definitely not the BEST CAMERA out there, but for a casual person, who wants good quality pictures, this is the right camera for you.""
"20111210","4.0","Excellent for photography, watch out for video.","I have been an owner of the FZ18, FZ28 and FZ35 in the past. All of them were very good in some areas, lacking in others. In my opinion the FZ150 is the best of the lot, with the best performance and image quality. Its response time is short and snappy. With some tweaking either in-camera or in post-production you can create excellent photos. I have been particularly amazed at the clarity at extreme zoom settings. And the handiness of the fold out screen cannot be overstated. When shooting video, this screen is also the best you can do with getting the best angle.BUT. Here is the biggest caveat. The MICROPHONE is NOT WELL ISOLATED. The mic is very sensitive and clear. SO sensitive that it picks up every little vibration from handling during shooting. I hear this MUCH more than from recordings made on the FZ35. The mic also PICKS UP ZOOM MOTOR NOISE! That's right. You will get a slight but definite buzz during the whole zoom range. You'll also hear the zoom button snap back to the center position at the end of your zoom. VERY BAD. This is a basic rule for video camera mics - don't pick up your own camera sounds! This means you will need to be VERY careful in handling during shooting. In noisy environments this whole issue may be masked by your room sounds. But in a quiet environment, like during church ceremonies, you WILL hear the zoom motor. I am very disappointed with the MIC issues. Using either zoom button does not remedy the zoom motor sound.That being said, the image quality of the video is excellent as well. You will be very happy with the camera in general as long as you can work around the MIC issues. I have not tried using the external mic so far, but do not expect to have to carry around a boom mic when shooting home videos. I will report back in a few months to update.""
"20111206","4.0","The most well-rounded superzoom on the market","The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ150 is a real joy to use. It has great performance, an excellent feature set, nice ergonomics, a serviceable viewfinder, a nice LCD on back, RAW shooting, a great video mode, a pretty good built-in flash. It is probably the most polished superzoom I have used and really is a pleasant camera to shoot with.When I first reviewed this camera, I noted mediocre image quality. Admittedly, this was a rush to judgement. The truth is that the FZ150 is capable of taking some very nice photos if you are willing to play around with the settings. If you just just iA (intelligent Auto) in all your photos, then I don't think you'll be all that impressed. But shooting manually and/or shooting RAW will get you some very nice photos. The photos might benefit from a little sharpening... but otherwise, detail capture is good, exposure is good. Color accuracy is spot on. It's really the best you could ask for given this class of camera.Autofocus performance is excellent. It is really is amazing how far these bridge cameras have come in terms of performance over the past couple of years. Shot-to-shot times are good. The menu system is pretty easy to understand and navigate. Although Panasonic packs so many features into this camera, that you probably won't understand all of its capabilities without reading the manual first.The LCD on back is of decent quality. Although like most, you have to crank up the brightness in the display settings for best viewing in direct sunlight. The EVF is a distinct improvement over previous Panasonic superzooms. Though I wouldn't really call it great though. It is usable. While this camera is constructed well, it feels a little more plasticky than its predecessors. But that also makes it a little more light-weight.The video mode on this camera is excellent. A great choice if you want a budget camera that does double duty for still and video. Admittedly I don't use the video much on this camera but from what I have seen it does excellent video. It even comes with an external microphone jack, which is a nice touch.The Panasonic Lumix FZ150 is a great camera that will appeal to wide range of folks. If you are just starting out with photography as a hobby and want a camera you can learn with, this is an excellent choice. It is overall an enjoyable camera to shoot with.""
"20111206","5.0","Update: I LOVE MY CAMERA. Hands down a solid decision made! Make sure you get a powerful memory card!","I initially picked up the Canon sX40 but returned it mainly due to the horrific LCD display and power button. I went to best buy and compared cameras, fell in love  with sony. The FZ 150 was not in display thought they had the other models. i have always loved panasonic but was skeptical of the FZ 150 just because of the 24X zoom. But 99% of the reviews i read online( trust me i read over 15 d/f reviews) favored the panasonic over the others. I'm surprised that pnasonic doesnt advertise this as 32Xintelligent zoom as the performance of the intelligent zoom is very good and image quality loss is quite negligible( i am sure there are experts who will critique this, but for a casual photographer the image quality is as good)Initial reaction has been excellent and will update the review after playing around with it a bit. I am so glad i did not keep the Canon. Sony was tempting but i think i made the better choice.update Dec 12, 2011WOW! I love this camera so much. amazingly fast and great pics, NO REGRETS AT ALL.BTW do not buy the kingston class 10 card for this, i lost my pics as it could not keep up with the burst speeds. Initially i thought it was the camera, but the card gave me a write error and when i recovered it , half of my precious pics were gone.Getting it replaced by San disk Extreme 30mb/s. Wish i could use the extreme pro UHS Speed Class 1 but research showed i will still not get the performance of the card as FZ-150 doesn't have the hardware to support it though it will still work as fast as the extreme.""

It still works. The newest version I have excels in every manner, except the 2.8 f-stop can no longer stay at 2.8 with the larger sensor, but with much better low light quality it is a worthwhile trade off. The newest feature of outstanding quality is the video. For professional use I still use Canon cameras and their best lenses, however for freedom and great fun the Lumix is my daily companion. It is the Swiss army knife equivalent in image capturing.""

It was Christmas 2007 went to Best Buy saw they had Panasonic cameras. I was always a big fan of Panasonic everything in fact. Picked up a Panasonic DMC-LZ3 point and shoot 5 MP  camera on the fly.Great camera it is the household camera and the one my wife uses on trips. Still in use today.2008 comes along I decide I need more capability, I went looking for a Panasonic only to discover the big box stores no longer were stocking Panasonic. So I purchased a Canon SX-10 a good solid camera but not a Panasonic.I sold my SX10 on ebay within 1 hour 2 days ago to a very nice person. Good time to sell old cameras and get this one.Buying a good camera is a pain, thanks to Rollas first review and all the replies I thankfully purchased this camera on Amazon. I got lucky buying sight unseen the camera is just perfect.Shots of the moon tonight show the craters even in overcast cloudy conditions.Video is crisp clear and true high def even in low light.This SD card works with this camera very well.

"20111203","4.0","Panning Mode in 1080/60p Not Smooth","All functions of the FZ150 work well. There is one exception, panning in 1080/60p video is not smooth. SDHC card used is class 10. This artifcat was not observed in a a Sony DSC-HX9V or the Sony HDR Cx-770v under identical conditions. Panning in 1080/60i is OK. Use standard setting in the intelligent dynamic feature to reduce highlights clipping. Reds show better when 'happy' is selected in IA and 'vivid' in other shooting modes. Can also experiment with reducing highlights clipping by setting EV to -1/3 or -2/3 but the shadows will appear darker.Correction: the stuttering problem in playing back the 1080/60p files is the fault of the windows media player 12 in windows 7. Videos can be play back smoothly using the VTC player. Panning with the camera in FSH mode is not the culprit. Verified by recording videos on fluid head tripod.""

Have shot several hundred pictures under a variety of conditions and they are all excellent.  Same for a couple of short flics I took.  I was able to see a couple of 'hot spots' on the sun while shooting the sun at sunset and also got a pretty good view of some lunar craters.  These were hand-held and w/o retouching...  I won't bother naming all the technical specs and stuff as they are found all over.  My only negative is that I managed to pinch myself a couple of times by the 'inverted' lens hood when I turned off the camera and the lens was retracting.  But I learned.  One more thing:  I have not seen anybody mention aesthetics.  The camera just looks great!  Had to look around for a case and found just the right size and price from Case Logic at my local ___mart store.I am a Panasonic fan and have grown through their Lumix line.  I still keep a TZ5 as a backup in the car.

After reading many reviews and lots of research I went with the fz150, and I am glad I did.  This thing takes great pictures.  So far, I have only used the preset settings or auto mode.  The auto tracking and face recognition are nice features that I never thought I would use.  After getting a chance to use both, I can say that it makes taking pictures a lot easier.  Also, this camera focuses fast, I mean really fast.  The camera is much lighter than I thought.  I can easily hold it with one hand for long periods of time with no problem.  Generally when I spend a few hundred dollars on a product I want to make sure that I am getting a good product.  For all of those on the fence about this product, all I can say is get it.

"20111126","4.0","FZ150","I'm not a professional reviewer or photographer...so please accept that I may bounce around a bit and don't cover everything. I would have probably rated it 5 stars if it was made with the same quality as the FZ35. I'm giving it 4 stars now, but will re-rate after I've used it more.I just received the FZ150 and will post my first impressions. I've owned the FZ28 and FZ35. I purchased the FZ150 to upgrade from the FZ35. I've only taken a hand full of shots with the FZ150. Both cameras were set to Auto, as picture quality in auto is important to a lot of people coming from point and shoot cameras. I wanted to know what the cameras compare straight from the box. Of course, manual settings can improve IQ in both cameras.Body:I must admit the FZ150 feels cheaper made than the FZ35. I was disappointed with that.The FZ150 has tiny little metal strap slots, on the FZ35 these were much stronger looking.The FZ150 has cheap rubber coverings over the ports, while the FZ35 has sturdy, well made plastic ones that open and close nicely.The FZ150 lens sticks out a wee bit from the lens base making me feel like it could be damaged more easily than the FZ35 that tucks away completely.The FZ150's battery door has a slide nub that is more annoying for me to open and close. I prefer the push-pull door on the FZ35.The FZ150 does have a hot shoe, Yea!!, which I wish the FZ35 had. I probably wouldn't have updated if the FZ35 had one, and I would have missed out on a sweet new camera. But, there is no plastic hot shoe cover in my box. I don't like leaving it uncovered when not in use.The FZ150 is both larger and heavier than the FZ35. Since I like to take pictures one handed, this quickly becomes apparent when I hold it.The FX150 battery also has a cheaper feel to it, though it is rated as 895mAh, vs the FZ35 695mAh. I have not tested the batteries.The FZ150 does have a rotating screen, and this is a big plus to many users. Unfortunately, I will get little use out of that feature, as I don't tend to use it.The FZ150 has a 6x greater zoom. This is a big plus for me.The FZ150 has a much cheaper, poorer quality lens cap than the FZ35. If I could swap them out I would.The FZ150 now has the camcorder button on the top of the camera near the shutter release. That is much more awkward for me to reach. I much prefer the FZ35 location near my thumb.The FZ150 has a auto/manual focus on the lens base, I'll have to play around with that feature.The FZ150 has a 52mm lens that accepts filters and lenses. Yea!!The button layout is different between the two cameras. Currently I prefer the FZ35 layout, but that is probably due to the fact that I'm used to it and don't much care for change, nothing that a little time won't cure..I've only taken a very few pictures with the FZ150. I will have to expand my review when I've spent more time with it.AS it is one thing I noticed is that the colors produced are warmer than the colors from the FZ35...I'm very much partial to the cooler color tones. If anyone knows how I can adjust that in camera with the FZ150, please contact me and let me know. I think I will miss my cool color tones more than anything else after I sell my FZ35.So far picture quality has been very similar in the few pictures I've taken. I've not tested all the settings. I've not taken action or outside shots. The only real difference I saw is when I took a shot of my ceiling fan while both the light and fan were on. The FZ150 was able to get a better shot of that.I took pictures of both cameras side by side as comparison pictures of the same still objects. I just need to find a way to post them.I will add more as I use it more.Please go to the link to view the pictures I've taken. Please keep in mind it was just a handfull of still shots that I took with each camera (FZ150 & FZ35) and shots of the camera bodies side by side. You may see them at: vanalyne boxers dot com/ Camera dot htm - just remove the spaces and add the '.' in place of 'dot'.""
"20111121","5.0","Great Camera","It's a camera that makes me want to find an excuse to play with a camera. :)Pros- The build feels solid.- It snaps shots off pretty fast.- Impressive focal length range (25mm-600mm equiv), even if the competition fairs a bit better this is still quite good.- Image stabilization works well. (I can snap shots off freehand at 24x zoom, and at least most of them will come out sharp. Not bad considering I have shaky hands.)- Has a pop-up flash, and also a hot-shoe for external flashes.- Can use a remote shutter with it (the $5 cheapos (such as the one made by Pixel) you find on amazon work fine too!), or an external mic.- It does 1920x1080@60p video, which is good. I got this for taking pictures though, not video.- Has 52mm filter threads. No adapter required. I can play with filters now! Telephoto/Close-up/wide-angle/fish-eye lenses are also an option available to this compact. I picked up a Raynox DCR-2025 telephoto lens to extend my reach. I also picked up a polarizer and some ND filters both for creative effect and to help with challenging lighting conditions.- The grip is good overall, and the controls seem to be in palatable places.- Intelligent Auto mode is intelligent (judges the scene, knows if you're shooting free-hand, etc). In most situations it makes good decisions.- Good manual controls.- Battery life is good.- Takes pretty pictures!! Colors seem accurate. Sharpness out-of-the-box seems about right. Noise doesn't become apparent until you really up the ISO. I've got some that I've taken at ISO 800 on a rainy day that aren't noisy.- RAW. This is one of the main reasons I went with this camera. The included RAW processing software (SilkyPix) is good, easy to use, and runs fine in Wine.- Fully articulated, hi-res, anti-glare LCD. Electronic viewfinder is a nice plus.- Very good low light performance for a compact.- Dedicated ISO button, function button (as in, you choose what you want the button to do.)Cons- Intelligent Auto mode will only record in JPEG.- idynamic only works if you're recording in JPEG.- Competition gives a bigger zoom for the $.- It doesn't make me breakfast. All cameras should make me breakfast.- Price. If I didn't need the zoom I probably would have went with a cheap DSLR instead. I may still do that and keep this for those situations where I need to zoom in, seeing as an equivalent telephoto lens would BE extraordinarily expensive (search for 600mm lens on Amazon, go on , I dare you! (Do be prepared to cringe if you do.))Other thoughts- If you've owned/used another Lumix in recent years, you'll be right at home with this camera as the menus/layout/etc are very similar.""

I don't care about the video part of the camera as I bought this for photography, not movie making.  I had a Canon S2IS for a longtime and loved that camera...then was given the Canon S5IS and fell out of love.

Awesome macro, great creative modes, the Intelligent Auto is nice, zoom is great.  The camera menu is very easy to move around in.  I love the weight, much lighter than the cameras that take 4 AA batteries (really!  I am AMAZED at how light this is compared to the Canon S5IS)!  Feels natural in the hand, buttons all in the right places and easy to reach.  I know this is 'fluff'...but this is the first camera I've had that the lens cap stayed PUT!I haven't had to 'edit' or process any of my photos in photoshop yet...they've come out sharp, crisp, and just beautiful, if I say so myself!

There is almost no shutter lag so no need to lock the focus with a half press of the shutter.Long zoom - When I had my first chance to use the camera it was already dark so for a quick test I went outside, pointed the camera at the moon, zoomed all the way, adjusted the brightness 3 full stops and from a standing position with no support took a great picture of the moon.  There is surprising detail in the light and dark areas and even at 24x no adverse blurring effects of a hand held fully zoomed photo.  Later I took several daylight photos with fully extended zoom and was again impressed with the quality of the photos as well as the image stabilization at long zoom.1080 video - This is one of the primary reasons I chose this camera.  When travelling I no longer carry a video camera, I take all my videos with a digital camera.  The early reviews of this camera suggested it excels at HD video and I can confirm it does.  The video & audio are both great, and so far I have not detected any noise caused by zooming while recording.Slow Motion video - Another feature that led me to this camera.  I have now shot several high speed / slow motion videos and am very happy with the results.  It performs as well as I need it to for this feature.  The quality is as good as you expect for the lower resolution captured in HS mode.  The camera is probably average in this category.  There is only one HS mode available and the resolution is OK but not great, also  you are shooting over 200fps so do not expect to use this in low light conditions.  Note that you access this feature through the Scene Mode (SCN).Burst mode - This is amazingly fast, 12 full resolution frames in a second.  It will burst as long as you hold down the button up to the maximum number 12 at the fastest rate.  This works better than other cameras I have used.  A great option for fast action.3D photos - Am interesting feature.  I am not sure I will use this  but I took a few to see how it works.  The process to take 3D photos is to switch to SCN mode, pick 3D, and then hold down the shutter as you slide the camera to the right.  It took a little practice to be able to do this reliably.  You need a 3D TV to playback the photos in 3D.I will post more later when I have had more time with the camera.""
"20111113","5.0","DMC-FZ150","I was amazed at the quality of the pictures I took of a water festival in Bangkok at night, with no flash, and hand held with no tripod. Just using the hand stabilization feature on the IA setting the pictures came out very clear.  Never had that happen before.  So many mew features to explore.  Blows away the F100 or the Cannon models in price alone.""
"20111112","5.0","Great camera","I have had the camera for a little under a month.  While a bit bigger, the added features and megazoom more then makes up for not fitting into my pocket.  The clarity at extreme zoom is fantastic, and the included software very user friendly""
"20111111","5.0","Take sports pictures like a pro with this gem!","Let me begin by saying that my knowledge of cameras is very limited and I am as 'newbie' as they come regarding photography.  My son was going to be playing in a national lacrosse tourney in Florida (We are from the midwest) and I wanted to purchase a camera that would let me capture all the action.  I was looking for zoom, burst, high quality action pics, and a reasonable price package.  Done, done, done, and done.After reading countless reviews and trying to make heads or tails out of every photography detail out there, I finally decided to purchase this awesome camera.  I could not be more satisfied.  After downloading the manual, it took me a couple of minutes to read about and set the action sports & burst settings.  With a couple of turns and button pushes, I was ready to go.  The pictures I took at the tourney are absolutely stunning.  I used the 5.5 pics/second auto focus burst mode and captured unbelievable action shots.  When my son went to shoot, I would capture the entire sequence from beginning to end with perfect focus - about 5 pics from the load to the end of the follow through.  Amazing is all I can say.  All I did was zoom in, put my son in the center of the frame, and press the button.  I was at least 50 yards away when I took the shots and they are perfect - like I was right next to him.  High level lacrosse is a very fast moving game and this camera made it simple to catch the action.  I would like to take some credit, but I would have no clue how to catch the shots that I did if this camera didn't make it so easy.In between games, we had the opportunity to head over to the beach a couple of times and the photos taken there with iA were just as good.  We took photos in bright sunshine, the shade, and at dusk using the iA mode and all the pictures were excellent.  We took some movies with the camera as well and they are also excellent.If I was a camera aficionado, maybe I would find some faults with this camera.  Since I am not, I can't find any so far.  If you are a novice like me, this camera will have you taking outstanding pictures as soon as the battery in charged.  Speaking of battery charge, we took about 800 pictures and five short movies over two days.  There was a lot of reviewing of pictures in the stands during this time and the total battery usage was about 1/3 of a full charge.  We used a class ten memory card and had no issues with lag or inability to shoot pics.  The camera's ergonomics are good.  Everything I used was well placed, easy to use, and I had no accidental touches that changed camera settings.  The camera seemed very lightweight - I mountain hike and this camera will definitely be in my pack from now on.I rarely write reviews - usually only if something is terrible or is a real pleasure to use.  This camera is definitely the latter.  If you need a camera to capture action shots and want to spend less than $500 bucks for the camera, card, case, etc. - you can stop comparing because this is it.""
"20111110","5.0","A winner!","For many years, I used SLR cameras and purchased a DSLR a few years back. I finally realized that some super-zoom cameras were on the market that would take pictures good enough for everything I did and would not require me to carry around multiple lenses. I bought a Panasonic FZ35 and was quite pleased with it. It turned out to be one of the better super-zooms ever made. My complaint was that I would like a longer zoom. I decided to try out another Panasonic camera but was put off by the tepid reviews of the FZ100.Since the FZ150 had not yet been released and there were only a few reviews of the camera, I purchased the highly praised Sony HX100V even though it lacked some features I would like to have. I was pleased with the pictures it took - up to a point. Thanks to a generous return policy of Amazon, I returned the HX100 and bought a Panasonic FZ150 which was the right move for me. I reviewed the Sony camera and you can read it elsewhere but this is a review of the Panasonic FZ150.While the zoom of this camera is not as great as some competitors, the intelligent zoom makes up for this. I was able to take high quality pictures of distant objects under a variety of lighting conditions using high zoom and generally hand holding the camera. Impressive! The FZ35 did a good job of keeping noise low up to about ISO 400. The FZ150 does the same but up to ISO 800. Even ISO 1600 shows low noise. I was able to read license plates from 3-400 feet away even in low light. I suspect that Panasonic has found the 12 MP resolution using a small sensor is a sweet spot and allows good noise reduction even at high ISO.I was able to take excellent closeups, the wide angle works well with minimal distortion and you can choose to record in RAW for better control in post production. And all of this works rapidly and reliably. The image stabilizer worked well in all but extreme closeups.To test both the video and burst modes, I stood near a train track and took pictures of oncoming and leaving trains. The burst mode is outstanding and the video is as good as can be expected from a super-zoom. The sound is excellent although in a quiet situation, you can hear the zoom being changed during recording. I like being able to choose AVCHD or MP4 for video recording. This gives you some control over video size, video quality and easy of use by various operating systems.The Sony has a panoramic mode while the FZ150 has a panoramic assist mode. With the assist, you can fairly easily set up successive pictures for merging using software. I found this assist allows you to control the resolution of a panorama better then when the camera creates the panorama. This is not a big deal since I mainly use this type of assist to merge 2 pictures rather than merge 5 or 6 shots and the software merge is fast.I was impressed by how well the FZ150 handled white balance. Outside, the automatic worked flawlessly. But this was also true indoors. I watched the camera readjust the white balance as I moved it between scenes illuminated by different light sources. This produced shots with correct color balance. With the FZ35, I had to manually switch white balance to maintain correct color rendition.A couple of other super-zooms do not have lenses with threads for filters. I was pleased to be able to use a UV filter (mainly to prevent lens scratching while walking through the woods) and use a polarizing lens as needed. I noticed that there are additional lens modifications available that fit the threads.Unfortunately, printing a full manual appears not to be in the cards any more. The manuals, both basic and advanced, are available in PDF format which allows you to print off sections as needed. But I still would like a printed manual provided by the manufacturer.The articulated viewing screen has good resolution although not as high as some competitors. I very much like being able to turn the screen over and close it. This protects the surface of the screen. You can use the EVF viewfinder which I like to use but did find myself using the LCD screen whenever I could.The FZ50 apparently requires a coded battery in order to see the amount of charge remaining in the camera viewer. I bought a non-Panasonic extra battery for the FZ150 and find that the amount of charge is shown in the viewer. This is a $ saver since non-Panasonic batteries cost less than those from Panasonic.I have used most every mode on the camera and find them all to do exactly what they are supposed to do. In summary, I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to buy a super-zoom. You can use automatic features if you are a neophyte or use the variety of settings if you are a knowledgeable enthusiast. In both cases, you will be pleased.""
"20111110","5.0","Excellent Camera in its class !","It's two weeks since I have this camera and this is an excellent camera I've ever seen !The photos are sharp and the video is amazing ! Before buying this camera I tried other 3 different cameras and I found out that this was the best choice even though the optical zoom is not that the best among its class. I tried  Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ47 after that I tried Nikon P500 and finally I tried Canon SX40 HS. This last one I found it good with its good image quality, an enormous 35x zoom range, plenty of features but the overall, Panasonic DMC-FZ150K was the best of all.The FZ150 wins because of a very few extra features: a faster maximum burst rate, extra manual control including RAW capture, and a slightly higher-resolution LCD, to name the most obvious. Their image quality is very similar and they almost handle equally well.While the FZ150 comes out ahead in my choice, it's really too close to call, a toss-up at best. Hands-on, experienced photographers who are looking for a superzoom should side with the FZ150 for its extra manual control and, for sports photographers, the better stabilization. More casual shooters might be wooed by the SX40's longer zoom and cheaper price--it's understandable, though I'd still  much recommend the FZ150 most of the time.""
"20111110","5.0","Great Camera!","This is the best camera in it's class or the best camera for the money!I tried seven different cameras, including DSLRs, withing the last several months - and the FZ150 showed the best proportion of convenience and quality to the price.""
"20111110","5.0","Perfect for everyday use","I traded the older FZ100 for this new model and could not be happier. It performs well and exceeds the FZ100 in picture quality and usability. Handheld shoots with higher ISO are very usable. Works with my 3rd party battery also. Otherwise not much to add to all the lengthy technical reviews here and elsewhere. Highly recommended if you don't mind the relative bulk compared to the TZ series.""
"20111110","5.0","the best team","The FZ150 is not going to disappoint, excellent photography and video in Full HD.

I had been thinking that I should move up to a DSLR, but love having all the lenses in one place. With a bad back, carrying all the equipment for a DSLR is intimidating and I love to have my camera with me every moment. I have owned an FZ18, the FZ28 and now the FZ150. So far very happy with Panasonic. This is one of my recent shots with the new camera. [...]""
"20111108","5.0","excellent "bridge super zoom " great stills and video","I like this camera a lot. For it sensor size it takes excellent still pictures/videos with its cmos sensor. It would be a great all in one travel camera for lets say a trip to Europe, Washington D.C. etc for may people . With the hot shoe, flip out screen and raw file shooting and excellent video its a very flexible camera. But it not a DSLR replacement yes for its sensor size it produces excellent still pictures between iso between 100 to 800. I bought three cameras for testing the Panasonic LX5, the FZ150 and the Sony Nex5n .I kept the Sony Nex5n its 16mp aps-c sensor its photo and video quality blow away any small ccd or cmos sensor camera. I was looking for a more compact dslr replacement for my old canon xt and Nex5n fits the bill nicely. I like the zoom for fz150 but I want better photo quality over zoom power . But for someone looking for a 'bridge super zoom camera' I think the FZ 150 is the best in class . It's picture quality is excellent for a small sensor cmos (best Ive ever used) for its price, FZ150 has very fast camera focus, loads of exposure controls, external mic, etc...(almost as fast as the more expensive nex5n). For me I like the Nex5n better. But for it price point the fz150 excellent camera for a family wanting a all in one still/video package with lots of zoom and excellent fairly fast lens  or traveler looking for all in one camera and not interested in carrying extra lenses this is a great camera. That why even though I returned my fz150 I still give it five stars for it class of camera its excellent just dont think it will replace a camera with a aps-c size sensor but it will give the 12mp 4:3 sensor cameras a good run for the money. Heck if I go back to 2 week to Europe I might consider FZ150 or a LX5 as nice complimentary camera to the Nex5n . Its a great camera just don't be fooled in thinking its a replacement for aps-c camera.""
"20111106","5.0","Panasonic DMC-FZ150 Camera","I purchased the Panasonic DMC_FZ150 camera to replace my old Canon SX2-IS that had died.  In my opinion, Panasonic has pretty much got their act together on this one.  It is nothing short of amazing.  I have been a big Canon fan for years and still like Canon equipment.  I was in a big debate with myself as to a decision when replacing my old Canon SX2-IS when it died.  I did a lot of research on the Internet and found that Panasonic had just released the new DMC-FZ150 model.  It was getting really good ratings by professional camera reviewers.  So I bit the bullet and decided to try it and I was not disappointed.  Great camera for the price.Are there others out there that are just as good?  I don't know, but I'm sure am pleased with this one.""
"20111105","5.0","Best ever!","I thought my earlier long zoom Panasonics were great cameras. Well, they can't hold a candle to the FZ150.  The speed of this camera is amazing.  Start-up is fast, focus is quick, and shutter lag is non-existant not to mention as many as 12 pictures per second.  I have found the tilting LCD screen much more useful than I had expected and that alone is worth the extra cost over the FZ47.  The most important thing, of course, is image quality and I can only describe that as excellent.  Detail is extremely well rendered and I've found no fault with color and light control.  The lens reach isn't as long as some rivals, but the extra 32X digital iZoom expands the reach and loses no apparant detail.  I acquired the available adapter to enable use of my old Olympus B300 telephoto which works perfectly with the FZ150 giving me a lens reach of around 1000mm equivalent. The FZ150's lens is also threaded--some others are not--so I can use a polarizing filter. I haven't even gotten into the video portion of this camera which is supposed to be great as well.I don't think it gets better in this category of camera. Of course I wish it was smaller and lighter, but I doubt that's possible with this level of functionality and photo quality and it's way better for me than a DSLR with lenses.  My FZ8 is still in the house as my wife's preferred camera.  It is smaller and weighs much less, but I haven't even had the thought of grabbing it instead of the FZ150.  This is truly a GREAT camera.""
"20111104","3.0","Plastic Camera","Have had my Lumix camera for years. Thought I might get something better with better optics to replace my workhorse Lumix that is made with real metal.This new Lumix replacement is smaller than my 3/4 years old Lumix. It is made with plastic. Assume there is not a metal part to be seen.Am short so my hands are smaller. Found the camera cramped anyway. OK, the optics at long range do not give me a sharper, bigger picture than my old Lumix workhorse. My ol' Lumix is sturdy. It has been jarred/banged hundreds of times. Once it even was dropped. Nothing went wrong with the old Lumix.The optics on this FZ150K are fine but are not what Panasonic tech quoted me.Am old school. Want metal stead of plastic. Want a camera with real camera feel. Making a product cheaper and skimpier does not new and improved make. It means they are cutting production costs left and right.This camera is an example of what is out on the marketplace. I'll keep my workhouse Lumix for years to come.This camera was returned within a few days.In defense of this Lumix FZ150K, if I did not have my ol' workhorse Lumix I would keep it.

"20111028","5.0","Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ150 just arrived","For a few years I've had a Kodak Easy Share Z1012 and couldn't find a thing wrong with it other than it was slow and not so hot at night. I recently took it on vacation and it did as expected.I started reviewing Kodak's as soon as I returned and that expanded into Nikon's, Fuji's, Sony's and Panasonic. To be honest I'd never considered Panasonic as a camera maker. Anyway, after almost settling on the Nikon P500 I started to find reviews on the FZ150 and while the Nikon has a stronger zoom, there really was little or nothing else it did better.My two biggest issues with the Kodak was the speed and the low light pics. I've only had the FZ150 a few hours (and will add to this review in a few days when I've had time to test it further) but already the speed is impressive, and that's with a class 4 SDHC card, the class 10 will be here in a few days. I've not tried the low light yet, but with the flash it's very impressive.I had to take some detailed pics of the inside of a computer today and was very impressed at the detail this camera captured and that was on full automatic.I look forward to learning and playing more it.Will update review in a few days.""
"20111020","5.0","A Great Super Zoom EVF Camera for Beginner to Expert or Pro thats fun to Use","I bought the FZ150 to upgrade and replace my Canon SX10is which has proven to be an excellent camera.  I chose the Panasonic because of excellent reviews and it seemed to have the right balance of upgraded features and performance. Before I bought the FZ150, I checked out the Canon SX40hs because it also had excellent reviews. The camera took very nice pictures but the camera did not feel as solidly constructed as the Panasonic. The SX40 had many new features and better image quality than past models, but it is just an upgraded SX30 which I found very disappointing. I thought the 36X zoom was too much unless you use a tripod. The Panasonic in contrast has a very solid feel and seems to have an excellent build quality at least on the surface. The camera starts up very quickly, and has very fast autofocus even with extreme telephoto providing there is sufficient light. The image quality is very good to excellent at 100 ISO and higher and degrades  a little as you stepped up to 3200. The 3200 ISO pictures had some noise but were a lot better than I've seen on previous small cameras. The vast majority of images I took with the Panasonic came out properly exposed,looked very sharp for a small sensor camera. Is the Panasonic perfect....no! I think it is the best super zoom out there. The Canon SX40hs is also a very good camera and would have been a good upgrade for my S2, S3, sX10 so it would be natural to want the SX40hs but the FZ150 has it beat in  features, performance and especially speed.The image stabilization with the camera is impressive to awesome. It is possible to get sharp images with the camera hand held with full zoom providing there is sufficient light. I think the reason for this is possible because of the improved image stabilization. The FZ150 is incredibly light and with the EVF (electronic viewfinder), it is possible to hold the camera much steadier. The low light capability is much better than my SX10, so in most situations, it is possible to get an acceptable images at a higher ISO.The FZ150 accepts 52 mm filters which is a standard size and easy and inexpensive to purchase. It's important to place a filter on the lens to protect it. This also helps in image capture with UV or Polarizer filters. The raw format is another important feature missing from competitors cameras. The extra mike port and the remote shutter port makes the camera more  useful. The best part of the camera is the incredible speed of focus, and speed of picture taking that rivals DSLR's. This camera is a natural for anyone that already has a DSLR and wants an all in one big zoom. The macro capability is limited to wide angle for closeup but using the zoom you need to back up to get proper focus. You can get very good macro pictures but DSLR are far better at that. This is a problem with all super zoom cameras but with practice you can get great macro images.I found the camera worked great using the default settings even on P which means even a beginner could use this camera with ease and grow into the more exotic feature set. I even think the pros out there would have a lot of fun with this camera because they wouldn't have to keep changing lens and all that it entails.  If you are an advanced amateur, you would also have a lot of fun using this camera and you might want to quietly retire your DSLR and save it for the occasional need for extra image quality. When I need super images, I still take out my DSLR but not often. Nothing beats a DSLR for macro work.One problem I encountered was the rear dial which is very stiff and I kept pressing it while trying to turn it. I checked with Panasonic and this is done by design. Turning the rear control more slowly provided better results. The Canon rear dial spun very easily and I preferred that feel. I understand the FZ100 had a dial that turned too easily and this is supposed to be an improvement. This is the only control that I thinks needs improvement in the next model.The video was excellent and  continues to surprise me with how great it is. I don't think the video from this camera or any DSLR will match what you can get from a good HD camcorder. It's very convenient to have excellent HD video in one unit. In reviewing the video for the last month I am stunned that it is as good as it is.The bottom line is that as good as the FZ150 is and it probably is the very best long zoom camera, it can't replace a pocket subcompact, or a video cam. When I travel I will take the FZ150 as my main camera, my Canon S95 (this is a great camera) for the pocket camera, and my Canon Vixia HD Camcorder. The weight of these three cameras is less than a DSLR with one zoom lens. It is impossible for one camera to do everything well no matter how good it is. This camera comes very close to perfect.Overall, I really like the Panasonic FZ150 a lot and think it is well worth the price and 5 stars, perhaps 5 star plus. It feels nice in the hand and looks good too. It takes excellent images and video and allows a lot of photo creativity. If you have never used a super zoom, its a great camera that once you use it, you may want to put away your DSLR if you have one. It is a fun camera for a beginner or expert photographer. I have tried the other super zooms out there and most have similar features. I think the Panasonic leads the field but the Canon, Nikon, Fuji and Sony all make similar cameras but not as good as this camera. It can be hard to chose. I recommend this Panasonic model and Amazon as always is a terrific company to buy from.Update:12/27/11The camera continually amazes me with outstanding performance. The more I use the more I like it. I took it on a 11 day cruise to the Caribbean and took some fantastic images. One cruiser was so impressed with the camera that he purchased one (FZ100) at the next port we stopped at. I would not recommend that because of warranty issues. I've used the rainbow imaging wireless remote (Rolla recommended) and it works very well. The vast number of images taken about 3000+ have come out very sharp, well exposed with natural coloring. The image stabilization has been very effective with virtually all of the long range zoom images even up to 36+ ia. Having standard 52 filters has come in handy especially using the circular polarizer. One disappointment which is true for all bridge zooms is that macro focusing requires backing up about 5-6 feet from your target while in zoom unless you macro in wide angle which will focus very closely under 1 foot. I generally use a DSLR for any real macro work since lenses will allow close focusing.Since I purchased this camera I have looked in every camera store and never saw the FZ150 being sold. I bought this camera sight unseen so many of you if in the same situation may need to take a great leap in faith to purchase this camera. The camera seems in short supply now so you may need to be patient if you do decide to buy it. I think this camera along with the other competitors are improving the super zoom cameras by leaps and bounds and if they could enlarge or improve the sensor and continue with improved lense design that at some point in the future they could outsell the DSLR and render them obsolete. The picture quality is so good even now that most of the time I prefer using the FZ150 to my Canon T1i and Canon 18-200is which is no slouch.Update:4/6/2012The more I use the FZ150 the more I enjoy using it. It has performed flawlessly and is one of the first cameras I grab when wanting a quick shot. I do take more shots with my Canon S95 subcompact because it can be carried everywhere and it take superb images for a tiny camera. I am planning to take the FZ150 on a cruise to Alaska soon and will test it against my new Canon 60D DSLR with Canon 18-200 Zoom lens. This doesn't seem like a fair test but I am very confident that the FZ150 will hold its own because of it's speed, great EVF and versatility. The FZ150 is also much lighter, has wider angle, and more zoom so I expect it may get more use. I will report back in June with my results. The 60D does have better weather seals so if its raining, it may get more use. I was so impressed by the Panasonic FZ150 that I bought the Panasonic TM900 camcorder recently also sight unseen. Its a great camcorder and the video is fantastic but more surprisingly this camcorder takes excellent digital stills too. This was my 4th Panasonic camera product and they all have been excellent with very good quality, good performance and very reliable. One tiny tidbit....I tried out the new Canon G1X compact digital camera with the dslr sized sensor. The FZ150 significantly outperformed the G1x in every way except the G1x may have had a little better image quality but was a pain to use and cost twice the price of FZ150. I think the current $400 plus price for the Fz150 is a real bargain for this great quality camera.""

"20111015","5.0","Photography is fun again.","It all started with a trip to the grocery store with my wife.  There, in the parking lot was a car show; and all I had was her point and shoot camera.  At home, safely in the trunk of MY car was my professional DSLR with just the perfect lens for the cars.  As soon as I got home I went to[...]/  and did a camera feature search.In my opinion any of the current crop of 'all in one' super zoom cameras is capable of taking nice, sharply focused pictures, so the trick would be to find one that met my particular style of shooting.  I like to take pictures in the HDR (High Dynamic Range) style which means I would need a camera that would bracket exposures - with a single press of the shutter.  I would also need a remote shutter release and the ability to save the pictures as RAW (for HDR pictures when there is movement and multiple exposures aren't practical).  As it turned out there was ONLY ONE camera that met my criteria; the Panasonic FZ150.  Given a choice of one, the decision was easy.I've had the FZ150 for a week now and I've put it through all its paces and judged the pictures.  I am truly amazed at how far camera technology has progressed.  The FZ150 continues to surprise me with its sharp focus and bright pictures.  Exposure bracketing is limited to three shots (one press of the shutter, three rapid snaps) but with RAW I can pull out twelve exposures 1 EV apart.  The 'motor' drive is unbelievable with 12 shots each second.  The zoom is fantastic and I found that 24x (600mm+) allows me to take 'macro' shots of insects from four feet away.It seems like (for me) photography just got fun again.""
"20111013","5.0","Beginner Here.. and I LOVE this camera","I am a true beginner with a camera with this many features. I knew that I wanted a bridge camera with superzoom capabilites, and I read all the previews and early release reviews on this and other new cameras. I chose this one based on all that I read. I can honestly say that I am thrilled. I have only started to 'play ' with all the features as I am still learning, but so far the images are so true to life. The zoom is clear.  I have not rated the video capabilites as I have not used that yet.  I have picked up so many tips just reading all the reviews and comments. If you are a beginner as I am you will not be disappointed. This is soo easy to use!""
"20111012","5.0","ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!","I own the FZ35 and thought it was pretty good! I noticed Panasonic was coming out with the FZ150.  I was interested in the 3-D aspect of the new camera, so I decided to order it.I've had the camera now for 5 days and have only played with it iA mode and it has knocked my socks off!  Couldn't believe it! WOW!  What beautifully sharp pictures!Saw the moon out the other night, and wanted to take a picture of that.  Unfortunately, I didn't have a polarizer lens in the 52mm size, so I stood outside with camera on tripod, holding a 55mm in front of the lens (trying not to get my finger in front of the lens) and shot a picture. It came out OK, but will re-shoot when my adapter comes in.Please go to my Photo Bucket Site to see a few samples of the FZ150 pictures!  A picture speaks a thousand words![...]Please be sure to to click on 'Zoom' to original size.""
"20111012","5.0","SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!","I have researched the bridge cameras for several months, reading reviews, downloading sample photos, and the Panasonic FZ150 seemed to be the winner. So I decided to get it on Amazon and it is better than I expected. The photos are SPECTACULAR and so are the HD videos. I couldn't believe the photos I took in a low light environment. I am truly amazed at the quality of this camera and I have not even started to explore the functions and possibilities. I can say without a doubt that this is the KING OF THE BRIDGE cameras. I am in heaven, this camera is going to be my companion for many years, it is a MARVEL, I am in love with it!""

"20111010","5.0","Fantastic! Much better than FZ35.","Based on my extensive review of all superzooms, both in 'travel' and 'bridge' categories, I recently bought Lumix DMC-FZ35. I was hesitant because of its high market price for a 2-year old model. Nevertheless, Fz35 seemed to be the last 'bridge' superzoom from Panasonic that got the picture quality right (their move to 14 MP CCD or CMOS sensors has not been a success from the image quality standpoint). Canons seem to have the best I.Q. overall, but significant chromatic abberation of their lenses turned me away, in addition to their bigger size and weight (I did not consider the longer zoom that useful). FZ35 seemed to be almost the smallest in the 'bridge' category with significantly better picture quality then any 'travel' superzoom. So I snapped one while they were still available.Testing FZ35 confirmed its great picture quality in the good light. However, bumping ISO to as little as 400 (which is needed to take a shot with moderate zoom in a shadow) produces degradation in image quality (I guess because of in-camera noise reduction). Going higher on ISO makes noise clearly visible, so much that indoor shots without a flash (which has quite a good range I must say) are no better than the ones from my old cheap compact. Video at the highest AVCHD setting (720p) does not look bad, but compared to my beloved (ancient) Canon HV20 camcorder, it does look a little choppy (? captured at 30p and recorded at 60p) and without fine detail. Quicktime MJPEG 1280x720/30p looks better (some blurring seems to come from AF struggling to keep focus with movement/zoom) but the files are huge. Despite FZ35's modest size and weight, unobtrusive lens and GREAT battery life (2 full days of shooting still pictures and video, using LCD, switching between record and play and all the time and I still have one bar on the battery left), the testing left me somewhat disappointed.Shortly after I purchased FZ35, I found sample pictures from FZ150 at imaging-resource.com (their Comparometer is a great tool). They looked (surprisingly) better than FZ35 even at good light. So, I took the plunge and got FZ150 too.Comparing the two, the drawbacks of Fz150 are its bigger size and weight (almost in dSLRs range, but in line with the rest of 'bridge' superzooms) and shorter battery life.  The lens also protrudes nearly as much as some smaller dSLR lenses (albeit the zoom is much longer) and zooming does not feel as smooth/precise as on Fz35. Despite the size, the camera still feels balanced in one hand. If you like to hold it as a SLR, there is a new toggle on the lens barrel that can be used either for zooming or manual focusing (really cool). The rest is a litany of improvements over FZ35: LCD is fully articulated, twice the resolution and with very nice antireflex coating. The lens seems to have a better antireflex too. Image stabilizer and autofocus seem to be more effective. AF, and the entire camera operation, is MUCH faster. Burst mode works great and seems to be limited more by writing on SD Card than by acquiring/processing the images. Most importantly, the picture quality: In the optimal lighting outdoors it seems comparable to an entry-level dSLR. Detail definition the the dark areas is better and indoor low-light performance is much better than FZ35 (ISO1600 still usable; seems to be on par with or better than any other 'bridge' superzoom). Handheld night shots now use the same principle, acquiring multiple images with shorter exposure and combining them together, that has been a feature of Sony superzooms for quite some time. They still cannot rival long exposure tripod shots but are quite usable, at least for small prints. Finally, video quality is considerably better, not only because of 1080p mode, but jitter also seems to be less pronounced, even if the zoom is longer. (I still feel my old camcorder does HD video a bit better though. FYI, both MP4 and AVCHD play flawlessly on PS3 directly from SD Card with an USB adapter; or you can buy mini-HDMI adapter/cable.)I personally would love if Panasonic put the new sensor and image processor in the old FZ35 body/lens, but market seems to prefer longer zooms these days. From all other perspectives, FZ150 will be a great all-in-one camera for travel that will likely allow me to leave my camcorder at home.""
"20111010","5.0","1080i and 1080p are NOT the same!!!","Hi:FYI, the FZ100 has 1080i video and the FZ35 has 720p, neither has 1080p...BIG DIFFERENCE!!!...The manufacturers conveniently state 1080HD to cover the slower refreshing 1080i over the faster and higher quality 1080p...For everyone complaining about the jerky video on the FZ150 but then state the 1080 on their other cameras is fine, they need to know that 1080p on the FZ150 requires more processing speed...That sometimes includes the computer processor, video card, software, RAM and especially the SD card..The 1080p moves almost double the data over the 1080i...I'll post more later..""
"20111009","4.0","A Good Camera","I originally wrote a review for this camera but subsequently deleted it.  I unfairly criticized it for 'jerky' video.  It turns out that the video was not 'jerky' at all but the fault of my Microsoft Media Player program. That program, in my two year old computer, will not play video recorded in 1080p smoothly. I discovered Real Player will. Once I tried Real Player my criticism proved to be incorrect.Now I re-evaluate the FZ150.  It takes pictures as good as my FZ35 but no better. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it and the FZ35 produce images that are pretty darn good, especially from such a small sensor.Where the 150 really shines is in versatility and handling.  It has a nice 'heft' to it which, to me, makes it feel like a quality piece of merchandise and in my big hands it feels right.The battery life has proven to be very good.  I've had the camera a week and have taken about a hundred pictures, about 15 minutes of video, played around with the camera menu settings and the battery indicator still shows two bars of the original three.  Very pleased with that aspect.The overall stabilization seems to be a little better then that of my FZ35, especially when shooting video.My original intent was to replace my FZ35 with a 4/3rds mirrorless or a SLR. When the FZ150 was announced it's features were so intriguing that I decided to wait and try it out.Under the right conditions (outside in good lighting) the images from the FZ35 and the FZ150 are really quite nice.  I have compared them with those from mirrorless and SLRs and they are surprisingly comparable, but not as good as far as noise is concerned.  The winnder there is the Sony NEX5N (if you can put up with its other vagaries). The ease of use and versatility, for my purposes, outweigh the small difference in image quality that you might get from the others.  I don't need nor want a complicated camera and I don't enlarge photos beyond 8x10. I am not a photographer, I'm a picture taker, but I really like the features that the FZ150 offers. I was going to spring for the FZ100 a while back but reviews critical of the image quality made me hold off; I'm glad I did.  Panasonic and Canon both as much as admitted that joining the mega pixel race was a bad mistake and the return to 12 from 14 makes a lot more sense.I'm very happy with my 150 and yes,  I know there are better cameras around and I'll probably buy one at a later date for but this one serves my purposes well.  Me buying a high dollar SLR and a multitude of lenses makes about as much sense as my buying a Ferrari instead of a Ford to go to the market for a carton of milk.11/17/2011 Follow upI attending my woodworking club meeting tonight and took over 80 pictures tonight without flash under artificial lighting - mercury vapor I think.  It turns out that the auto white balance is considerably better than what I got from my FZ35. I am really pleased with this development.""
"20111008","5.0","The dmc-fz150 Saves Me a Bundle, and ya its fun.","I either would go this route or at least 3 times the dollar and learning investment into a T3i system. My needs are more tool than toy. I spent the best part of the day taking and analyzing about 1500 images and about 2 dozen short videos, mostly 1080/60p AVCHD or 1080/60i AVCHD and uploading to a private YouTube test channel.Also the other mixed bag of needs such as perfect color matching, macro etc.Simply put, it works, it just flat works, no fussing about, not super resolution yada that unlimited doe could buy, but better than anything I have tried with lots of flexibility to milk out every drop of goodness I need and then some.The video is smooth and keeps up with fast hand and body movements, the sound is solid and Gordon Laing of CameraLabs has confirmed it works with multiple Rode Mics. I've seen a simple intervalometer on YouTube doing its thing and I have the more advanced unit on the way. DPReviews second series of studio images proves exccelent high ISO performance is there to be had.

"20111007","5.0","Great Replacement for FZ100","As an owner of Panasonic FZ100, I was generally happy with that camera and I could live with its shortcomings because it did most things pretty well. But when the chance came, I brought the new Panasonic FZ150 to see if this camera can do better.It does! On the surface, the body of FZ150 and FZ100 are totally alike. Only major difference lies at the barrel where there is a zoom controller on the FZ150 and not on the FZ100. It weight about the same, same size, they even shared the same battery so if you own FZ100, the battery for that will work on FZ150. Very helpful for me and for any other owners of FZ100.In a nutshell, FZ150 does everything FZ100 can do and better. It doesn't add anything really new but changes what needed to be changed to make it better. They did switched out into a new CMOS sensor with lower megapixel and were successful in making the quality images that easily surpassed FZ100. There is a new OIS stabilizer and the high sensitivity mode that allowed you to shoot night photos has been improved. Auto-focus speed on the FZ150 have also been drastically improved. Like I wrote, everything FZ100 can do, FZ150 can do better.The video capability has been improved and I think there is a slightly better video coming out of this camera then its older brother.Some of the new features as 3D mode is nice but I have no real use for it. It doesn't have a GPS but who needs that in a camera??If there are people who might be thinking about upgrading, I would say its worth an upgrade because the improvements are pretty major. You would think Panasonic would give owners of FZ100 some coupon discount or something for the upgrade.For many, the major shortcoming of this camera is the 24x zoom which is one of the lowest in the ultra-zoom camera class nowadays. Canon SX40 got what...34x or something like that? But I do know that Canon SX40, their new flagship of the ultra-zoom still got a major autofocus problem that can't get a fix in changing light condition that FZ100 can do with ease. And if FZ100 can do it with ease, think what FZ150 can do!!If everything hold up well enough, I may hang on this camera for some times come. It is rather expensive buying a new ultrazoom camera every single year!!""

Great camera capable of so much more than I have the knowledge to do... yet I have been able to create amazing photos and video straight out of the box.

I am NOT a photographer by any means; I have been leaving the camera on its iA (fully automatic everything) setting, but the results have been delightful so far.  Since I've been posting images (above) I figured I should include a review as well.  The camera has impressed me thus far!""
"20111006","5.0","Exceeded Expectations!!","After trying out the new Lumix G3 to replace my FZ30, I was sorely disappointed. The sample images I viewed on dpreview.com were excellent, but the pictures I took were horrible. That's because they were using super expensive lenses. Hmm....The kit lens was useless and I wasn't wanting to spend lots of money on more lenses. I also missed the zoom capability....enter the new Lumix FZ150. This looked more like the camera I have been using since 2005 (the FZ30), just totally upgraded.Right out of the box, I was not disappointed. The FZ150 is smaller than my FZ30, yet still feels very comfortable and secure in the hand. All the buttons seem to be in the right place. (The G3 was not designed well and I kept hitting a button I didn't want to press when I held the camera.)The FZ150 also takes great, natural-looking pictures indoors (which was what I was looking for) without a flash. It also takes wonderful macro images, which the G3 had a very difficult time doing. The G3 wouldn't even TAKE the picture if it wasn't in focus. The FZ150 focuses quickly and accurately.The video looks great, as well. The only drawback is the format of MP4. It does not import in Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0 without first being converted to an avi or mov file, but that seems to be the trend in all newer cameras, so I won't fault the FZ150 there.All in all, I am very, very pleased with this camera and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants to take great pictures without the bulk and expense of a DSLR.UPDATE: I took this camera to an event this weekend and it performed almost FLAWLESSLY!! Out of hundreds of pictures only a few were deleted! Also took lots of video (in MPEG4). As a heads up, the video did have a jerky playback on the computer until I converted it to an avi.""
"20111005","4.0","Wow!","Wow!The features on the newest Panasonic Lumix 'Bridge Camera' are to say the least awesome!  I am not new to photography, having earned my way through college via wedding and portrait photography.  I own a Canon 7D and a Nikon S9100.  This camera is essentially the bridge between these two types of cameras.  My Canon does everything that I have ever asked of it.  The Nikon is an excellent 'Pocket camera'.The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ150 is an incredibly laden camera with rich features that I am still learning to use.  From the burst mode to video mode in stereo in AVCHD / MP4 Quicktime Motion JPEG to creative video mode to the iA - intelligent Auto Mode with it's auto scene selection  to the usual program modes, P,A, S, and M to the Advanced scene modes.  Stills are recorded in RAW and JPEGNot to mention the zoom to iZoom to being small and light weight!I am not here to compare to other 'Bridge Cameras'.  But this camera in all likely hood will be used a lot, especially on trips.Lastly, the fact that I can manually focus the camera when my Nikon S9100 can not is a big plus.  You also zoom two different ways.  One at the shutter release button, the other on the left side of the barrel of the lenses.This is no way meant to be a complete review.

"20110827","5.0","Great feature set and very good images","AMAZON HAS ASSIGNED A DATE IN AUGUST.  THE FOLLOWING WAS WRITTEN IN FEBRUARY 2012Update with info on RW2 (Panasonic RAW)--2/18/12In case anyone else is having problems working with RW2, I offer these findings.  My main purpose with all of the viewing progrrams is (1) to be able to see what the images are, delete the bad ones, and (2) get the good ones into JPEG to archive, or into TIFF or PNG for PP with PhotoShop CS4 or PSE.-- Xnview: didn't measure up.Color of larger thumbnail/preview at bottom is washed out, almost gray.Open the file: a dialog box says: 'This picture will be converted to RGB with 8bits per component.'Click OK. Open image. Image is washed out, dimensions are shown as 4016x3016x24, 14.33MB.Save as RAW: icon shows Adobe RAW, but if I open it in CS4 or PSE6 the result is abstract gray smears.  Forget this route.Save as JPEG: Image is washed out, dimensions are 4016x3016, 969KB!--FastStone: love it for other file types, but not RW2.Full-sized RW2 images are beyond washed-out; they have a serious color cast that is very difficult to correct. There also appears to be detail degradation.--Irfanview: with extreme highlights, requires a very dark setting.In an image containing breaking waves in sunlight the brightest parts of the foam are totally blown out. (This does not occur with FastStone in spite of the other issue.)  One fix: Options>Properties/Settings... check only 'camera whilte balance;' set Brightness to 0.5 (default is 1.0). This eliminated blown highlights and didn't appear to degrade color.--RawTherapee.  Works well, but clunky.Seems to avoid the above problems.  I don't like the UI as much, but it provides true color and luminance, and a variety of Save As... choices.RawTherapee allows viewing of an image that retains the visual characteristics of the original RW2 image, shows the original pixel dimensions, and will save in a variety of formats at original pixel dimensions without perceptible change in visual characteristics.--Adobe DNG Converter: the key to a solution.Not a viewer, but gets RW2 files into a more universal format.NOTE: If you convert to DNG, viewing with some viewers may be misleading.  Apparently the JPEG embedded in DNG is  size, rather than the  size used by RW2.  As a result, images on screen will appear blurry with some viewers.--Windows Viewer (requires DNG codec; see below): did the trick.Ended up doing the best job for the purpose stated above.  Windows Viewer gives a quick way to view 1/2 size DNG images, clearly and with no visible chroma or luminance issues. (The blown highlight issue persisted when viewing DNG with other viewers.) Unlike programs that open in half size and save in half size, with Winviewer you are one click away from opening a full-size image in Photoshop (CS or PSE), with no change in visual attributes.  The codec is quickly downloaded and installed.If you want the codec, it's at: http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/DNG_Codec............Finally I was able to get the FZ150 from Amazon after flooding wiped out the factory in Thailand last fall.  All the shots described below were hand-held.  All shots were ISO 100 unless noted.After using the camera, it is much better than I expected.  One reason I bought it was that a number of camera review sites called it the best superzoom available today.  One site had the Canon SX40 rated as #1, then the next week they tested the FZ150 and it outranked the Canon.  General consensus (by actual testing) seems to be that the Canon has slightly better IQ in terms of detail and sharpness, but the FZ150 is stronger in a number of other areas.My observations (all still shots; I will discuss video when I've had a chance to use it):I have some standard shots I take at full zoom, including structures 1300 and 1600 yards away, and shots of car license plates at distances ranging from 285 to 500 yards.--At 1300 and 1600 yards using full zoom, you can count the roof tiles on a house if you enlarge the image on the computer.--At about 300 yards, you can take a picture that allows you to easily read the license plate on a car.  At 500 yards, you can easily read street signs.  This compares amazingly well to a DSLR using 300mm zoom.--Color is phenomenal right out of the box; very natural.--CA/PF was minimal even at full zoom; only slight traces in high-contrast reflective areas (chrome bumper, in sunlight, against a black car), and even then not noticeable unless the image was magnified.--RAW is a huge plus.--Images are clean up through 8x10, and in many cases 11x14 or a bit larger.  If you crop and/or enlarge beyond that, there's more noise than I would like, but keep the ISO low (100-200) and you're OK.--Zoom is very smooth and quiet, and AF works well during zoom.--Image stabilization is phenomenal: full zoom, hand-held, with subjects almost a mile away resulted in images with zero camera shake at a shutter speed of 1/500.--AF is excellent, and actually performed better in complex visual environment than some DSLRs.  So far, no hunting.  I will have to see how this works in a flat light or low light environment.--Burst is great.  I prefer 5.5fps over 12fps because for birds, seals, breaking waves, and surfing shots (99% of the action I shoot) 12fps is overkill.  At 5.5fps I get about 3 seconds of action before the buffer fills and the camera starts to slow down.  I haven't timed the write time, but it isn't bad.  The entire burst mode certainly compares favorably with some DSLRs.  RAW files are bigger, so the buffer and write time get in the way a bit more, but the shooting speed is the same.Operation:--The dial (for aperture and shutter speed) is a bit small and a bit hard to turn.  Kind of cheap, actually, which is out of character for this otherwise very nicely-built and well-finished camera.--A tripod mount will block the batter/memory card door.--The EVF is pretty low quality (flickery)--but a whole lot better than nothing.  You can use it while wearing sunglasses.  It's satisfactory.--The articulated screen, which can be folded against the camera to protect the surface when not in use, is outstanding.--The Quick Menu, accessed by a simple touch of the button (which doubles as a delete button in the playback mode), is very convenient.--EV and ISO buttons are a great feature.--Video button is a great feature.--Pany makes sure you don't delete anything by mistake: you have to go through several choices and confirmations before delete happens.--CAUTION: Photoshop and MSoft do not recognize the FZ150's brand of RAW.  And many folks don't want the hassle of using the Pany softward.  Luckily, a free program called FastStone does handle FZ150 RAW.  You can open the image in FastStone; from there you can either do PP directly in FastStone or save the image as JPEG, PNG, etc. and then, with one click, open it in PhotoShop. NOTE: PhotoShop will tell you that the image does not have a color profile associated with it, and will ask you if you want to assign a profile.  You will get the best results if you select 'print' profile.  Colors will be much deeper and richer.BOTTOM LINE: I am amazed at how good this camera is for a hopped-up P&S with a tiny (1/2.3in) sensor.  I knew the feature set was great, but after buying an FZ100 and returning it because of abysmal IQ, I wasn't sure that the new sensor had fixed the problem.  It has.Additional information: I just took another of my standard test shots, of palm trees, tile roof and the ocean.  The tile roof is 400 yards away, the far palm tree about 440 yards.  The ocean is about 650 yards.  There is quite a mix of colors and textures.  Hand held, full zoom, f/4.2@1/500 using default color setting, converted to JPEG for uploading purposes.  I am frankly surprised at the IQ and resolution of these images.  They are better than some of the very same scene that I have shot with various DSLRs with kit lenses.  They are slightly soft due to lower resolution of the camera, but they do not display any blotchiness or distortion or PF, unlike some DSLRs with kit lens.  And the softness can be reduced with minimal sharpening.  (Before you tell me how kit lenses are not a real test, let me remind you that the lens on the FZ150 is a kit lens.)More later, after I've had a chance to do some action shooting outdoors in more challenging conditions.2/16/12Just took a variety of hand-held shots around the ocean.  All shots were ISO 100.  The results:--Native color/WB is excellent, very true to life.  If you want to make colors more vivid or extreme, it's easy to do with a number of settings.--Detail is very good.  At full zoom, things like scaffolding or venetian blinds are captured very clearly.  If you're printing up to about 11x14 or thereabouts, you should be happy with the results.--For extreme high contrast in bright light (such as white foamy waves against a deep blue ocean), to avoid highlight blowout it's a good idea to shoot at -1EV.  You can get good results anwhere between f/5.2 @ 1/500sec and f/6.3 @ 1/800sec; for consistency it's better to expose for the highlights and use the latter setting.--AF on flying birds was phenomenal.  Very quick and accurate.  You can get more resolution and better IQ with a DSLR, for sure.  On the other hand, many DSLR users report frustration with shots that are out of focus.  A soft shot is better than no shot, and so far I have had zero shots out of focus.  Keep in mind that pelicans, cormorants and gulls flying along the shore come in sight, pass by, and disappear very quickly.  There is no time to get set up for each shot; you have to pick your settings and be prepared for something very much like skeet shooting when a subject appears.  The FZ150 is very good in this regard.  Surfing shots are very easy by comparison.--Zero PF so far in high contrast situations at the beach.  A major plus.--My subjective impression was that in burst mode, shots were softer even though AF was on.  Not bad, but not as good as those captured by the larger-sensor (2/3in) Fuji S100fs in burst mode.  All the shots were taken between 1/500 and 1/800, which should have been enough to avoid blur due to motion; it's the same shutter speed range I always used with the Fuji.--The camera is small enough and light enough that you don't feel it to be a burden, unlike DSLRs or big superzooms.--Took some shots indoors at the supermarket while waiting for my coffee to grind.  Hand-held, f/2.8 @ 1/40sec, ISO 100, no flash.  It's not the brightest interior in the world, but the images were clear; you could easily read the closer labels, etc.  No blurring, but the images were a bit soft.  Exposure was perfect.  No complaints.  My subjective impression is that this is a better outdoor camera.--Bottom line outdoors: DSLRs and 2/3in sensors will get more detail, less softness, and higher IQ in most cases.  But the FZ150 is totally satisfactory for prints up to about 11x14 or so, the burst is outstanding, AF is great, and because the camera is less than half the weight of a DSLR or a Fuji 2/3in, it's a camera you will have with you.  Which means you will get more shots, and more good shots..............THE FEATURE SETI bought an FZ100 when it was a fairly new item.  It had all the features anyone could want, except one: it did not generate good images.  I sent it back; thank you Amazon, for standing behind the product and taking it back if it isn't up to snuff.  Even Panasonic had to recognize that the FZ100 was not a winner.  The FZ150 has a totally different sensor, with fewer megapixels to generate noise.  The IQ is much better.What's to like about this camera?  Panasonic is making one of the few, if not the only, P&S cameras with all the small features that enable serious picture taking.--Front threads (52mm) for filters.  This means being able to use CPL and other filters for great effects without having to resort to add-ons, apapters, etc.  The more you get into photography (especially in high-contrast or glare situations), the more you'll appreciate this.--Articulated LCD.  This is truly convenient for odd angles, so you don't have to get down in the dirt or climb a tree to get the low or high shot, or twist yourself into a pretzel for that perspective shot around the corner.  Also good to avoid screen glare.--EVF.  The articulated LCD is great, but there are times, especially with bright sun or long range with full zoom, that you'll see and frame your subject far more easily with the EVF than the screen.--Serious continuous mode.  12fps (no AF) or 5.5fps (AF) at full resolution.  Lots of cameras tout fairly high burst rates; they don't promote the fact that this is only possible at very low resolution, like 3mp.--Decent buffer.  For many types of action shots, 5-6fps is adequate, so if you keep AF on and shoot JPEG at 5.5fps you can get several seconds of action before there's a slowdown.  Lots of cameras tout high burst speeds; they don't tout the fact that you only get 1 second of burst before the buffer is full.--RAW.  If you care about color, this is major.--Remote.  Less commonly used, perhaps, but very useful if you need to put your tripod in an awkward place, where it would be difficult to trigger the shutter by hand.  Also avoids tripod shake.--Hot shoe.  I never use one, but for many people, it's a must for better flash, etc.--Plenty of manual control, for getting the picture you want.In short, this camera has all the features of a good enthusiast DSLR, and some features that are lacking even on some DSLRs.""

I didn't photograph everything I wished I did, over the years,not bringing the SLR along,becauce of its size, plus the lenses. I started using a digital point&shoot camera 7 years ago. Giving up the great pics.my SLR produced. Now with the Lumix FZ-150 I have both!Plus the superb video,which I used to get from my camcorder.My wife and I travel.Looking at a past trips pics., to us is a big part of traveling. Now not only will I take stills,but video clips as well. I looked at a lot of camears and bought,the Lumix FZ-150.Besides all its' features,I wanted.It also has full manual controls. Look at this cameras' features. You can use it as a simple point shoot or create beautiful,artistic shots!Or anything in between! Anyways,this is a real 'do-all-camera'.""
"20120512","5.0","We love it so far","We were looking for a better, but still simple to use camera for indoor and outdoor pictures of kids' sporting events and this camera is a noticable upgrade over our campact point and shoot Sony camera we only purchased last year.  The zoom is great, the picture quality is good and the burst functions are really good for sports.  We have used the 40 and 50 burst mode to take picture of our son batting.  With some many shots taken in such a short period of time you can playback the 40 and 50 burst modes as a slow motion video and we are able to take pictures with the baseball just getting to or coming off the bat.  We plan to use the burst mode to help analyze baseball and tennis swings in the future.  The 40 and 50 burst mode playback is similar to Dartfish for those familar with the sports videos. The camera focuses and takes pictures very quickly, another plus for sports photos.Battery life has been better than expected.  We purchased a 16 GB memory card since you can very easily take a lot of photos using the burst modes.The camera has many automatic settings to choose from and also has many manual settings to fine tune your photos based on your environment.  We still have a lot to learn about all the features but we have been very pleased with the camera so far and are pleased we purchased the camera before the recent price increase.""
"20120512","5.0","Great burst mode for sports and a long-lasting battery","I've had this camera for nearly a month.  I bought it to replace a Panasonic FZ-28 because I was having difficulty following the action in sporting events using the fastest full-frame (10 megapixel) burst mode with refocusing between shots, which was about 2 frames per second.  The screen freezes momentarily after each shot, and 2 fps was too slow to allow me to pan successfully.  The FZ-150 has a 5 fps full-frame mode (12 megapixels) with refocusing between shots, and that has proven to be fast enough for most, though not all, situations.  If I were in a situation where refocusing is not important, the FZ-150 offers 12 fps with the full 12-megapixel frame, and I may try that in the future.Eating memory with the burst mode is not a problem -- I got a 32-gig card.I like the frame selection feature in 1080p video in which you can take a 2.5-megapixel photo without interrupting the video.Battery life is impressive.  I bought some extra non-Panasonic-branded batteries, based on my experience with the FZ-28, for which 3 batteries equalled a full-day of shooting.  It turns out the FZ-150 can go a full day (in my kind of usage) on just one battery.  The non-Panasonic batteries have the 'chip' which allows the camera to read their state of charge.  I got them on Amazon from Big Mike's Electronics.  About $18 versus $47 for the Panasonic branded battery, including shipping charges for both.A downside is that the camera takes time to digest big photo bursts -- it says it is writing to the card.  This takes seveal seconds during which the camera's capablities are reduced.  It just seems to me to take too long -- my card is a class 10, so I don't think the card's speed is the limiting factor -- and I blame it on the camera's bufferEven with this downside, I give the camera 5 stars.  The photos are beautiful even under difficult conditions, and the video is sparkling clear, partly a result of very effective image stabilization.""
"20120511","5.0","Amazing","All I can say is, this camera FAR surpassed my expectations! Well worth every penny. I can't believe Panasonic isn't a more popular line of cameras!

"20120507","5.0","This is a six star review......","This camera has so many neat features, it would be hard to tell youabout all of them.... I particularly like I-Zoom.  You can go from 24X up 127X zoom in most modes, try the 'P,A,S,M' modes..Don't forgetto turn on 'digital zoom', too. The pictures, HS 240, Macro are just fantastic.  I prefer this over the Nikon L810.  A few hundred more, but worth every penny of it.Some of the features in scenes have not been implemented.  Like i-night, i-sunset,i-baby, etcMaybe a firmware update?I have yet to be disappointed by this camera. Motion detection would have been nice.  No other camera can match the 127X i-zoom!I use an Eye-Fi 8GB card in my camera.  BY the time I take picture andsit down to look at them, on my Samsung 55' LED ES8000 tv, theyare already there, to be published to my Facebook account or not.

"20120501","5.0","Awesome bundle in a small package","Earlier had the Nikon D90 with a couple of lenses, this camera is equal to that and more in a smaller package. Basically a bridge camera with a small sensor good upto 16x20 prints. the zoom range is excellent for both wide angle shots and telephoto shots.I have been very impressed with its performance. The in-camera processing is nice and you can output RAW for post processing. Make sure you buy a class 10 SD card for the HD video.""
"20120430","5.0","Performance beyond my expectations","The main competition for me was the Canon SX40-HS.  But it has firmware that severely limits its functionality for my purposes (iso limits, lack of RAW support, etc.).  It would otherwise be a very capable camera.First and foremost, the clarity and smoothness of the FZ150 video is far better than I had hoped for.  The 60fps frame rate makes all the difference in the world over 24fps.  I'm so glad I didn't settle for less!  It takes some processing power to play it, though.  My laptop isn't fast enough, so I either plug the card into my TV or PS3's USB or use a minihdmi-to-hdmi directly from the camera.Zooming and autofocus are enabled while recording, though autofocus is disabled while zooming.  The tracking focus can keep birds in focus as they fly by.  The only issue I have is with the camera automatically enabling OIS for videos.  It works great for hand-held shots at high zoom values, but only when the camera needs to be held still.  I found that overall it made my videos very jumpy/jerky, so I disabled OIS for videos in the options and it now works exactly how I like.The 24x zoom can focus in on objects only a few feet away, allowing near-macro shots or very detailed video of skiddish animals from a distance.  I dismissed the izoom feature as just a fancy autofocus (and imo, for full-frame images, it still is), but in video mode the izoom goes up to 32x zoom with no loss of quality.  That was a very nice unexpected surprise for me.This camera has a very fast shutter response and autofocus, greatly reducing the number of missed or blurry shots.  When zoomed in the autofocus tends to keep farther objects in focus.  This can be addressed by putting the camera in macro mode, or by using manual focus.  It can also take pictures very quickly.  It is hard to explain how fast 12 fps is, but I can best compare the sound of the shutter while in burst mode to a (very quiet) machine gun.  It also recovers _very_ fast for another burst.The color accuracy in the pictures and small screen is top-notch.  I take a picture, hit review, and the colors are very close to the real scene I just pictured.  I've tried this with mountains, clouds, flowers, and even a bon fire with great results.I read elsewhere that it had no HDR capabilities, which means I'd have to painstakingly adjust the EV up and down for each HDR I want, potentially ruining the shots.  But it actually does have automatic HDR functionality, even if it is hard to find.  In the P/A/CUST and a few other modes, hitting 'up' on the directional pad adjusts the usual EV and Flash levels, but there is also something called 'exposure bracketing.'  This sets the min/max exposure values around the center, and automatically takes 3 pictures with those values whenever the shutter is pressed.  So it can easily take quick hand-held HDR's.  Oddly, the bracketing is reset whenever the camera is turned off, so you have to set it again.The panorama assist function is nice.  No more need to approximate the overlap for the next image.  I still prefer to wing it to save time.There are some small complaints I have, though.  The options and button functionalities change depending on which mode the camera is in.  This got annoying fast, and made it difficult to really learn the camera well.  It's not a big problem, just takes a bit sometimes to find what I want.The HDR functions aren't in iAuto.  It is annoying to have to change modes so often.The lens is very vulnerable in its position.  I keep accidentally touching and smudging it.  I've ordered a filter kit so I can use the UV filter to protect the lens.On a side note, 'night portrait' mode isn't really designed for night portraits where there are sources of light other than the camera's flash.  A few of my first 'night portrait' pictures look very much like everyone in it was blazing with fire (it looked very real, actually). I later deduced that the shutter stays open for a short while after the flash fires, leading to some very interesting effects if the camera or subjects move after it fires. (In the flaming people example, I had apparently lowered the camera after the flash fired.)  This can be stopped by changing the mode to 'candle light,' among others.  But I actually like some of the odd effects it adds-- I see it as a feature.""
"20120423","5.0","Panasonic DMC-FZ150K","Pros: This camera went on a 10 day throu Germany and France and I am very pleased with the quality of both Video and Still pictures. The battery life is better than anything I have used from any other maker. This includes Nikon, Pentax and Sony. Interior low light subjects came out great and tele was fantastic. This is a great travel camera. Does it all and is light weight. Use of the flexable screen enabled me to get some intresting videos after putting the camera on an telescopic extender. The purchase shipment from Amazon was fast and easy.Cons: The only frustration with the camera came when I accidentally pushed the Burst mode button (which is easy to do as there are a lot of buttons) which then shuts off the forced flash function. Therefore I could not use the forced flash function when I wanted to. The problem was resolved in minutes with a phone call to customer service and the use of the Reset function.

I am also very happy with the super zoom function and the clarity of the photos it is able to take.""
"20120420","4.0","Using the Lumix DMC-FZ 150K","Since getting the camera, I have been putting it through its spaces.  On the plus side, the camera functions well and reliably.  The images I have obtained are as good as the ones I get with the Nikon D300.  In parfticular I like the inherent color saturation of the Lumix.  After importing the shot into Photoshop, very little manipulation is necessary to 'improve' the image.  Resolution is good and the picture remains sharp even after some cropping.  As a back-up camera, I feel that I made the right choice.  One of the features that I find very useful is the EV function in association with the built-in Histogram.  The Histogram shows the distribution of the light spectrum of the scene as I see it.  If the exposure has to be adjusted (EV) the Histogram shift as I make the adjustment.  All that before I even take the picture.  In essence, there is no guessing as to what the image is going to look like.  That function alone is worth the camera as a whole.  I also like the Quick Menu which allows me to make changes 'on the fly' as it were.  Another feature that I find valuable is the extreme close-up that it can handle.  When shooting small objects that is a very valuable.On the negative side, I am a bit dismayed with the eye level viewer.  It is cluttered with too much information.  The color rendition through the view finder does not represent the actual image.  The option is to take the shot using the LED viewer.  But that is awkward, particularly if one is trying to shoot vertically.  Another things that seems strange still is the extreme light weight of the camera.  This is in sharp contrast to the Nikon D300 which is heavy.  The lightness makes the hand-held shooting very unstable.  My recommendation is to use a tripod in most instances with a wire remote shutter.  Others have mentioned quick release plate blocks access to the battery, memory card compartment; not the best design.All in all, I like the camera.  I will keep it as a good backup.  I recommend it for the high quality images it records.""

I only gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 because of the view finder. May be my old eyes but don't feel like you can see well how the picture is before shooting. Overall I would highly recommend this camera!""
"20120416","5.0","Wow! Smarter than Me","This is a wonderful little camera. It is so small, sharp and intelligent. I upgraded from a Fujifilm FD 6000. This cameras is at least as sharp, low in noise and much more sophisticated. The sensor on this little baby is smaller than my old FD 6000 (6 MP and 1/1.7' sensor), which worried me at first. But, the images are probably better.I only took it out for a few shoots but I love it. So does my wife who isn't into photography. I've been a photographer for over 40 years. This is going to be my favorite camera.A couple things I like the most are the fantastic image stabalization, small size, low noise, long zoom, and RAW format. The Intelligent Auto function is awesome. I love the menu. There are so many features that I haven't had time to use them all yet.Buy this camera. It rocks!""
"20120415","4.0","Very handy camera with many functions","This review will be short.  There are a couple of well-written long reviews that cover many technical details that I will not try to repeat.I am a long-time amateur photographer who has used and owns many SLR models as well as DSLRs and mirrorless compacts.Although I get may compliments on my photos, I really don't make any prints larger than 8x10, don't do anything commercial and my principal objective with my photos is to have memories of trips, friends and family.  In travel, I love ancient ruins, architecture, some scenic views and lifestyles that are different from my own. I have found that changeable lens cameras take wonderful photos, but in many conditions (dust, damp, climbing a ruin or back road path) changing lenses is a hassle and the weight of the equipment is a burden.This camera offers fine quality photos that meet all of my expectations, an ample zoom range that covers more range than multiple lenses for my DSLRs, and a multitude of features that often exceeds the feature set of much more costly cameras.My favorite thing about this camera is that it offers RAW format in addition to JPEG.  At one time I wasn't much of a fan of RAW images, but as I learned how to use post-processing to regain details in otherwise washed out skies or dark shadow areas, I discovered that it is possible to get photos that reflect more of what is seen with the eye (which has a greater dynamic range than a camera) using RAW.  Now I shoot RAW plus JPEG in most situations.  The RAW feature on this camera is something not on most 'bridge cameras' and is the one single feature that convinced me to make the purchase.The camera's 24x zoom is not as long as the 30x and up on some bridge cameras, but the long end is equivalent to 600mm in a 35mm film camera.  That exceeds the focal length of virtually every interchangeable lens I have ever owned.  I don't need more.  Moreover, I don't want more.  At 24x, you are at about the real limit of zooming that can be done without serious quality sacrifice due to optical issues and due to the fact that at these extreme focal lengths, camera movement is wildly exaggerated, making it essential to have a pretty steady hand.On the negative side of things, I find the owner's manual to be irritatingly obfuscatory.  It really wouldn't take a lot of work to make it user friendly, but it seems to have been written by a non-native English speaker.  Struggling through it with camera in hand, you can eventually figure things out, but it is a labor of love at times.The camera has a mild HDR (high definition range) setting that is a little weak for true HDR.  I do like HDR photo capabilities -- not for their initial output, but for the fact that they can capture a wide range of light and dark and they can, with some tweaking of contrast and levels, become good JPEGs.  They can be very forgiving of difficult lighting situations.The camera is light to carry.  The battery has lasted longer than 300 shots (and I am taking shots with both JPEG and RAW outputs for the most part, which I count together as 1 shot) without going below 50% on the battery meter.All in all, I am very pleased with this camera and the photos I have been able to get out of it.  I expect that, in the near future, some e-bay shoppers will be getting terrific deals on my DSLR and mirrorless cameras as this camera appears to deliver everything I need.""
"20120414","5.0","A Happy Camper With This Panasonic","It came down to the new Nikon P510 and the Panasonic fz150, both super zooms using the same three digits in their names. The 42x zoom of the Nikon was very tempting, but ultimately I chose the Panasonic for its extra features, the great price I lucked upon, and its familiarity. The 150 is my third Panasonic and one of two ( a ZS7) I own currently. If you own or have owned a Panasonic, using the 150 should be easy for you.So far I have no regrets about choosing the Panasonic FZ150. When I buy a new camera (at least one a year) I look at as many photographs as I can taken with the candidates. Plenty of photos are on various review sites as well as on Flickr and Amazon.  In my internet travels I saw more outstanding photos taken with the Panasonic than with the Nikon.Some other things I considered:The Panasonic has the RAW photo option.The Panasonic can be fitted with filters and a telephoto lens. I have one on order.I liked the package of scene modes and effects on the Panasonic. Check them both out to see which you prefer.Yes, the Nikon has the longer zoom, but the Panasonic has something called Intelligent Zoom which will give you a 32x reach with no loss of quality. For twice that reach you'll have to drop down to five mega pixel pictures, but I've found even those to be acceptable.Also consider that the Panasonic has a hot shoe and a flip out LCD screen that enables you to even take pictures of yourself. The Nikon may have a brighter and better LCD screen, but the Panasonic's can be adjusted for brightness, and when the sun is just too much, there's always the viewfinder.More goodies on the Panasonic are the mike jack, large mode dial, great battery life, excellent image stabilization, a dedicated movie mode, and a zoom/focus control on the camera's side. Video quality is good on the Panasonic and with video configurability, one can get very creative.I have found the Panasonic to take excellent pictures in low light or bright light. Not all of the pictures taken with this camera have been keepers, but the majority have good color, tone , and detail.As a former owner of a Canon SX30, which isn't a bad camera, I prefer the performance, speed, and automatic settings of the Panasonic FZ150.UPDATE: A few dates after posting this review I took a series of shots of Mrs. Spudman's anniversary roses. Took some with the Panasonic and some with the Pentax K-r.  I could barely tell which pictures came from which camera. One of the best of the bunch came from the Panasonic FZ150. It's posted on Amazon..UPDATE 2 - Ever greedy for more zoom I bought a 2.2x telecoverter for the camera from a vendor on Amazon. On a trip to Cape May I didn't use the converter until the last day there, not out of need but out of curiosity. Even with 'only' a 24x zoom, I seldom have a need for more reach except when I go undercover for the CIA. The teleconverter did expand my reach but at the expense of clarity and blur. A steady hand, some support,  or a tripod is recommended for these long shots.""
"20120412","4.0","Good multi purpose camera","pros:Very good all around camera.Easy to use, lots of features and modes.Good video quality.Flip out LCD screen is super handy!Very good electronic view finder, best I've seen on a point and shootTreaded lens for filters, nice feature.Real lens cap.Hot shoe for external flash (I'm using my old Nikon flash, cool!).Cons:So so low light level quality (like most point and shoots).Hunts for focus in low light.Lens tends to feel lose even though it's secure.""
"20120405","4.0","FZ150 a big improvement over earlier models BUT ...","The Panasonic FZ150 is a big improvement over comparable earlier models I have owned, especially in the image quality which has improved dramatically, even at full telephoto range. There are far less chromatic aberrations(color fringes)and very little noise in low light or in shadow areas even at 400 and 800 ISO. This is most likely due to the quality of the lens and a better sensor. I miss the manual focus feature of my old FZ20 that actually had a focus ring like older 35 mm cameras. The specifications say the FZ150 has manual focus, but in reality it is a digital feature that you can control with a button, not a manual focus ring, which for me would be more intuitive. The flip out LCD viewer is sometimes annoying because it gets in the way of where I would like to position my camera for a good shot. The camera is a bit smaller and lighter than my earlier models, and for me I would prefer larger and heavier, which keeps it more steady for telephoto shots and video. The position of the buttons on the right side are a nuisance when holding it because they lie directly under my thumb and I am always hitting either DISPLAY, VIEW or MENU by mistake. I didn't have this problem with earlier miodels. I have to retrain myself. The video features are much improved over earlier models too. They had low resolution video, and you could not zoom once switched into video mode. You had to zoom in to your subject before turning on the video recording. I'm not a big video user, so this improvement isn't a big deal for me, although it might be for others. Overall, the improved image quality is what makes me happiest about this model.""
"20120405","5.0","AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I had the Panasonic FZ47 before the FZ150 and there is a big difference in low light/high iso photos!!. Full HD videos are really great. I really love this camera!!!!!!!!!!""
"20120330","3.0","Haven't Given it a Fair Chance Yet...","After spending countless hours researching 'bridge' type point-and-shoot cameras, I took a leap of faith and ordered this camera. I had just about zero time to put it through its paces before leaving on a trip to Japan, so I pretty much kept it on the IA setting since so many folks here had suggested that setting was more than acceptable while getting past the learning curve. I'm home now and just downloaded the shots I took, and have mixed reactions. Some of the shots are quite good, and some are disappointingly bad. The color on most pics is quite a true representation, which is great. The macro shots I took are stunning. Many of the long-zoom shots are also quite good. In both of those instances I switched the camera to the mode specifically for that situation. What's not so great thus far are many short-to-middle distance shots taken with the IA setting.  Not sure why that is, since some shots taken from the same spot with the same settings are just fine. Obviously, now that I'm home I need to take the time to really read through the manual and try all settings. I had considered returning this camera, but after re-reading reviews here, I've decided against that for now. My point is to say that just using the IA setting out of the box did not produce the results for me that others seem to have achieved.But to be fair, I haven't done enough homework to give any further review. Will do so once I have, but for now just suggesting to others who may be in the same time-crunched boat I was: IA settings were not quite what I was expecting.""
"20120330","4.0","Too Early To Tell, But I think I Can Love This Camera","I've only had this camera for a couple of days, and haven't had much time with it.  But here's a quick, almost out of the box, review:I was looking for a good camera that I could do stills, and 2nd angle video's mainly for on-location, live music.  Obviously low light/backlight/stage light performance is critical.  The two camera's I was considering were this one, and the new Nikon P510.  Given it's intended use, I went with the FZ150 for the four following reasons...it has a hot shoe for mics & external flashes, much better video performance, a threaded lens for filters & special lens attachments like a telephoto lens or polarizing filter.  From what I gather, the P510 may take better still pics in some situations.  But the FZ150 is more verstaile with much better video, more features, and more functions.Here is what I DON'T like so far.  The ONLY way to turn the flash off & on is to open & close the flash boom...that sux!  You can, if it's already open, and you're in some of the manual modes go into the menu and control flash & type.  But if the flash boom is closed, even if you have the flash set to on in the menu...it will not pop up & fire.  All this makes for missed opportunities, and more time fiddling with the camera instead of using it.  I'm used to a single external button to manage the flash no matter what mode I'm in.Another cumbersome thing is the thumbwheel control...it's very difficult to use.  I've also noticed that some settings in the P Mode will effect how it shoots in auto, (IA), such as color balance.  So again, this adds fiddling time...and possible missed opportunities.  I'm used to Auto being totally independent of any other settings accept being able to turn the flash off with the press of a button.Some of the GOOD points are it's extremely fast when shooting pics, it's very sexy, macro shots are amazing, landscape shots are amazing, night shots of skylines & buildings are awesome even when shooting by hand, indoor shooting is equally as impressive.  Lighting does sometimes have a yellowish look to it unless you change the color balance, but at least that's quick & easy.  With a hot shoe, ext mic jack, threaded lens, video capabilty & features...you will not find a more versatile camera.  And it seems to do it all fairly well.  In short, my issues are with function set-up, not performance.  I'm not sure yet...I need another shoot or three.  But I think I can really love this camera!!! :-)""
"20120326","5.0","very good","I'm far from being a photo pro, so this camera works for me perfectly. Especially all quick-shutter modes (like 240 fps video or 12 fps photo). Just add some filters and you will get outstanding pictures!""
"20120324","5.0","In Love with this Camera!","I am one of those people who researches for hours and hours before purchasing anything. I read all the reviews and watched all the video's. It came down to Sony's HX100 and the Panasonic FZ150. Right now I couldn't be happier with my choice. This camera has wowed me from the moment I took that first picture. The lessened zoom power has not bothered me at all, especially since its optical zoom extends it 32x (plus extended zoom up to 50x with certain pictures sizes) and it works great! And thats without a tripod, no blur at all. The Intelligent Auto Mode is fantastic! I had a hard time finding the slow motion video, finally found it under Scene Mode (scroll down to High Speed Video, thats the slow motion). I love all the different modes. I was blown away by how well I could photograph my dog (a greyhound) running at full speed, unbelievable! I have a canon DSLR, but the FZ150 is my new favorite. This camera just feels so confident.""
"20120324","5.0","Panasonic Lumix FZ150 Camera","Although I haven't yet used this camera extensively, so far it has worked easily enough and has taken pictures which are perfectly acceptable to me.  The FZ150 got great reviews from most of the online sites I checked and was the top pick in the 'super zoom' category for several of them.  Furthermore it has 4 features I consider essential: a viewfinder, a fully articulated LCD, an adequate zoom (24x) and the ability to take pictures in rapid secession.  For the camera I selected a LowePro Edit 110 bag which comfortably holds the camera and its essential accessories and which can be carried by its handle, shoulder strap or velcro-attached belt loop.  I intend to learn the FZ150's features in the coming months so I'm prepared to use it to full advantage on an upcoming fall trip.  I have no significant negatives to report at this point.""
"20120322","5.0","This is the one I've been waiting for","I am not going to go into all the technical details because that has been covered here thoroughly in other reviews.  I have been taking photos all my life and have always been a good amateur but not quite a professional.  This camera is exactly what I was looking for.  It takes wonderful pictures and videos and has a bounty of features.  I needed something to take sports photography as well as family photos.  This fits the bill perfectly.  Between the Leica lens and the CMOS sensor and the burst feature I am now set with anything I need to do and not have to carry around a bunch of heavy lenses.  After it came and I played around with it I was so thrilled that I ordered a second one as a backup just in case anything ever happened to this one down the road and they weren't available anymore.  I rarely do that so that is my highest endorsement.  Five stars!""
"20120321","4.0","Amazing but ...","I absolutely love this camera. The slow motion feature makes everybody jealous!But two weeks after buying it, the internal lens began cracking spontaneously... No hit, fall, nothing. Just poorly assembled.Hope it doesn't happen to you! Good luck!""
"20120320","5.0","Great for those who want the camera to do all the work","I've had the camera about a week.  Previously had the Lumix FZ50 and have really enjoyed the features it offered.  This model is incredible.  We usually are taking landscapes and as we spend a lot of time in the San Juan Islands, WA, sealife is our standard.  The stills are easily taken with mode option made so easy it encourages you to try.  The ease of using the video obsoletes our camcorder.  The quality of either stills or videos is like real life.  While walking around the airport where we live, I spotted a unique WWII plane.  Although I had gloves on, I fumbled pulling out the camera, advancing the telescopic lens to chase him down the runway, and got a burst of 3 pictures, which even showed the pilot in the cockpit. I was impressed.The camera is smaller than the FZ50, which is what my wife wanted.  She also wanted to take pictures of the bald eagles which we see quite frequently this time of year in the islands, but the telescopic feature of the FZ50 blurred when taken at full optic range.  This model does not.Inside pictures using auto take very good pictures, either still or video without additional lighting.  It appears to be able to take low light pictures but does start showing some noise when there is no outside light.This camera feels just right for doing the rigorous outdoor life we enjoy.  Time will now tell if that holds true.""
"20120320","2.0","Photo examples here are too soft, poorly exposed.","If I had to judge from the sample photos submitted, and not by the written reviews, I would Not buy this camera.  Most of the photos here look as though the photogs did not know how to take full advantage of this kind of camera, or it just doesn't take good pictures.I guess one really just has to go to a showroom and try them all out oneself, then buy the model he/she likes best, preferably the one actually tried out.Good Luck.""
"20120319","5.0","Read the Manual.  Great camera.","My initial review was wrong - the camera comes with built-in memory, you can add a memory stick.  There is a setting that essentially gives point-and-shoot.  But this is a very advanced camera with lots of settings and lots of adjustments.  It's very quick - startup, downloading pictures, etc.  As I learn all the in's and out's I'll be able to do just about anything I want.  It deserves 5 stars.""
"20120312","4.0","Wish the price would come down","I remember seeing this as a pre-black Friday special for somewhere around $327.  They sold out within an hour.  They were then on sale all the way to Christmas for about $370, I think.  I guess I should have acted, back then.  Nikon lowered its camera by almost $100.When will the price come down on this baby?""
"20120309","5.0","Very pleased with camera","I bought this camera for taking indoor and outdoor amateur sports shots, group photos, artistic landscape pictures and pictures of people at events.  I wanted a camera that worked in high and low ISO ranges, had burst mode and a good wide and telephoto range, and had a viewfinder.  I also did not want to pay the expense of a DSLR or have to keep swapping lenses.After just a few weeks, I am very pleased with the FZ150.  It is significantly better than my previous digital cameras.  The 25mm to 600mm range is more than enough for most macro, wide angle or telephoto pictures that I can imagine taking.  As a test, I read a standard printed letter posted on a bulletin board from about 25 feet away by zooming in and reading it off the LCD screen.  At its widest setting, I could capture an entire room in one frame.  I am able to stand half as far back from groups as I needed to previously to get the entire group into the shot.  I was able to take a great macro shot of a remote control from a couple inches away, as well as of a trophy from 10 feet away.  The stabilization makes taking shots at 24x very doable even handheld.The burst mode menu is very nice and easy to access from a dedicated button on top of the camera.  Most cameras require a complex menu system to turn on and off the burst mode.  At 5.5 fps, I shot about 6 or 8 seconds of shots before a 1/2 second pause, and it continued with another 6 or 8 seconds of shots before the next pause.  The autofocus during burst was pretty good too, though obviously not as good as without burst mode.I like the on/off being a switch instead of a button.  One of my old cameras used to come on in the carrying case and chewed through batteries like candy.  The battery for the FZ150 seems to be pretty good.  I have done a lot of testing, including a lot of LCD screen and flash testing, and it seemed to take a while before it dropped a bar.  My only beef is that the charger does not have a light to indicate when the battery is done charging.  It merely turns off the other light that indicates it is charging.  The first time I went to charge the battery, I was not sure if it had come unplugged.Taking daylight scenery shots was very impressive as was the full telephoto range of these shots.  Taking nighttime shots was rather impressive and much better than any of my previous cameras.  I have not had many opportunities to take high ISO shots, especially indoor sports shots yet, but the limited shots that I did take give me hope that I found the camera that I want.  I will know more when spring sports season starts, though the high ISO sports shots will have to wait till fall sports to test.The biggest drawback to this camera is my inexperience with the Panasonic menu system.  It feels almost like relearning how to take pictures compared to my other cameras.  The menus and features are easy to get to and to manipulate, but without knowing what many of the icons mean, it is hard to know what to select.  The pdf manual is next to useless.  It took me nearly an hour to determine which setting meant 'fine' vs. 'normal' JPEG photo quality.  The manuals were useless and the web was no better.  I eventually figured it out by seeing which setting had the most number of pictures left on the card.  (The answer is that the arrow with the 2 rows of bars was the fine JPEG setting).  I suspect that anyone already familiar with Panasonic cameras will not have this issue, but it is a learning curve for me.  Also, for someone who just wants to leave it on iA mode, the camera can do all the work for you and the difficult menu icons are not a problem.  The iA mode actually does a fairly good job of selecting the right mode for the given shot, though it is not as consistent as manually turning the dial to the right mode, and often changes modes from one shot to the next, even if the situation has not significantly changed.Other than the learning curve, this is a wonderful camera.  The picture quality is very good.  The download software is good for an out of the box package.  I love the stereo-audio HD movies, though I do not shoot movies very often.  I like the fact that I can capture 3.5 Mpixel pictures while recording movies or after the fact in post production.  The native HD format was exceptionally good, though the translated MPEG2 format was a bit grainy.I was worried about the flash after reading some reviews about reflection from dust, but I did not see much problem with that, even when taking pictures out my open window during a snowstorm.  There were some 'bubbles' but nothing that I have not seen with flashes from other cameras.  I also like that I have full control over the flash being open.  Many digital cameras automatically pop the flash up making it difficult or cumbersome to turn the flash off.  On this camera, if I don't want the flash to fire, I just don't pop it up.  I also like that it has the option to add an external flash or remote trigger, if I want to purchase the accessories.I was also worried about the 'plastic' feel that many reviewers claimed, but I have not found any issues with that.  The camera feels solid and fits well into my hand.  While the zoom lever is not as comfortable as the barrel zoom of a genuine DSLR, it is still at least as comfortable and easy to use as any bridge or point and shoot camera that I have tried.  It is a little bigger than most point and shoot cameras, but it is smaller than most DSLRs and many bridge cameras.  I suspect that the reviewers who were complaining about the feel of the camera were comparing it to DSLR cameras.  This camera is probably the second best 'feeling' digital camera that I have ever owned, after my seven year old Sony, which really did feel like a DSLR.  The biggest problem with my Sony is that it is hard to carry around, which is part of why I wanted a new camera.  The FZ150 is much easier to carry back and forth everyday.Overall, I would recommend the Panasonic DMC-FZ150 to anyone who wants a really good camera and doesn't want to fuss with the expense and additional lenses of a DSLR.As a note, I bought some accessories when I bought this camera.  Buying a filter to protect the lens is always a good idea.  I would recommend against doing what I did and buying a doubler and wide angle add-on lens for this camera until you see how well you like the range that it already has.  I am very pleased with the out of the box range and wish that I had not purchased the additional lenses, though they seem to work fine if as long as you use manual focus.For reference, I am a high school teacher and amateur photographer.  I take pictures of various school indoor and outdoor sporting events, as well as pictures of the students during classes, pep rallies and other special occasions.  I am the unofficial school photographer for the yearbook and school newspaper. I also shoot outdoor landscape pictures for fun.  I have been taking pictures with various cameras for about 30 years, starting with a Brownie Hawkeye as a child.  My previous digital cameras were Canon, Sony and Nikon brands.Update (3/14/12): I tried out the lowlight features at a high school musical this weekend and it worked great.  I put it on the 'high sensitivity' scene mode and was able to take fairly clear pictures from row M.  It was a dark stage except for the spotlight on the singer.  From wide angle, the faces were washed out, naturally, since the costumes were dark, but when I zoomed in to let the performer fill the screen, I could actually get the eye color of the performer.  I had no trouble zooming even father to fill the screen with just a head shot that looked like I was standing 5 feet away.I took movies and captured still pictures both at the time of the event by pressing the button (which slowed the camera a little for half a second) and after the fact in post processing of the movie.  Both seemed to come out nicely, thought the post-processing pictures were smaller than the ones taken during the event.  The sound quality seemed to be as good as any dedicated amateur movie camera that I have seen in the past.""
"20120304","5.0","My first upgrade from the Wal Mart special.","Love it!  Wonderfull pics of my daugther's volleyball games.  Wish I would have bought it sooner.  I am looking forward to taking it on vacation this spring.  Great camera for a beginner.""
"20120301","5.0","Fun camera: Does it all, goes everywhere !","This is a remarkably good superzoom from wide to telly and macro. Photo IQ is very good across the entire range of the zoom lens. Some fringing is present if one enlarges to 100%, as is small sensor noise but for screen display and moderately sized prints the FZ 150 is more than adequate. High def videos are excellent, and in terms of focus speed, accuracy and sound quality better than my D7000 Nikon.  Its simply a very good camera in a very portable package: no extra lenses, minimal bulk and weight, and a very good image stability system. With raw capture and three customizable shooting settings you get to have full control over your images. Also exposure bracketing, 3D picture mode, slo mo video, and many other features add to the fun of the camera.Ok, so there are a few minor shortcomings:  a larger, more easily operated rear thumbwheel would be good.  The one on the camera is a bit slippery (wheel indents are small and rounded) and can be hard to turn, especially with cold hands. The functions accessed and adjusted with the thumb wheel are well chosen and for that reason the thumb wheel should operate a bit better. The articulating screen is very bright and clear but can be a bit difficult to open when mounted to a tripod (I frequently leave the screen closed to avoid damage or scratches). I added a small flap of self-adhesive fabric (velcro loop side) to the back of the screen for a grab handle. Also it would be nice to access the SD card without removing the tripod plate. The lens cap inner pinch points are quite slippery, I added small pieces of self adhesive velcro (hook side) to improve the grip. I'd also like a bulb setting for long exposures and an IR remote control.  But really these are all minor points, this is such an excellent camera as is, and I know I'll enjoy it for many years.""
"20120228","5.0","Best Bridge Camera on the Market","Since this camera is not easy to find, I too purchased it based on other user reviews and I am glad I did.  I always made excuses for not taking pictures, but after owning this camera my excuses are all gone and I am having fun.You get what you pay for, and this digital camera is positioned in the market right in the middle of a compact $100 camera and a $600 entry level DSLR- (plus all of those expensive lenses you would need to buy which would easily jack the price up to $1,000).  That's why at 4-$475 and the impressive and useful telephoto lens, I don't have to mess around with changing lenses.1)  I believe this is one of the fastest cameras out there in terms of capturing the shot in focus in real life situations both indoors and outdoors.  The other cameras from Nikon and Canon are very slow, but the Panasonic captures shots very quickly and since I am usually trying to capture kids running around like crazy I am very confident when using this camera.  I am a novice photo person, and one of my shots won picture of the day in one of the websites that I submitted a photo to.2)  This camera works perfectly in low light situations, which is paramount during performance that mandate 'no flash photography'3)  I have the option of shooting HD Videos as well, and the autofocus works perfect.4)  Very simple and logical controls.  I read the manual, but just trying different settings on the camera is the best way to learn.I have no regrets and I am very happy I bought this camera.""
"20120227","5.0","The best bridge camera so far","My previous camera was the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX100V. It has build-in GPS, more zoom, more mega-pixels and auto panorama.

I sold the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX100V.""
"20120225","5.0","This is it for me","I have playing in photography for fifty years, and have upgraded of late to a Canon 5D Mark II and a bag full of L-series lenses.  I finally decided this package is just too much in weight and size to carry around.  While I have a couple of point and shoots, neither have really good resolution.  After doing some research I decided a 'good' mirror less bridge camera would fulfill my needs. I didn't realize I was beginning a quest.  The short version of which is the Panasonic is my seventh camera to evaluate.  What I wanted was a light weight mirror less unit with excellent resolution, good zoom and auto focus, flash and electronic viewfinder.  All the cameras had video, but I don't normally use it.  I should also mention I take many pictures of animals, dogs, horses and the miscellaneous bird.  Zero, or close to it, shutter lag is very important, as with some of the units tested my dog could literally walk out of the picture by the time the shutter tripped.  It was also very important my wife could pick up the camera and take a picture of whatever hit her at the moment.I bought my sample cameras at Best Buy, Costco and Amazon, which is my favorite except for the fact one can't handle the camera beforehand.  All have excellent, no hassle return policies which I made use of.  I evaluated two Nikons, at least one Sony, Canons and two Panasonics.  One Nikon was the relatively new V1, which took the best pictures (I felt) but didn't have a built in flash and I was  trying to stay away from interchangeable lenses.  Oddly, I could usually tell within five minutes whether the camera of the day was the 'right one'.  This bugged my wife who in the beginning would say 'why don't you give it a chance?' to now, 'you haven't liked six others, you won't like this one!'  Not surprisingly however, time won't cure the fact the camera doesn't feel good in one's hand, can't focus nor do whatever else you want.I should mention in passing my testing method is extremely rigorous.  I sit on my porch and take pictures of my dogs and horses who wander around the property.  One wouldn't think a camera would have trouble taking sharp, in focus pictures of a dog eight feet away, but most did.  As my price range was roughly $500 to $1,000, I don't think I was asking 'too much' of the respective cameras.The Panasonic was ordered from Amazon and felt right coming out of the box.  It even had a user's guide which many did not.  It has no shutter lag, takes excellent sharp, well saturated pictures.  Low light sensitivity is good, and it is light weight.  It is a camera I will be comfortable using around town and on trips.  If you're on the fence, buy it from Amazon and you'll be happy you did.""

"20120211","5.0","Excellent Camera","This camera is amazing. I bought it as a christmas present for my wife who enjoys taking photography but is a long way from being a professional. A DSLR and all the lenses and complexity of use wasn't practical for our purposes so I researched the upper echelon of 'superzoom' cameras and most of that research suggested the fz150 was superior to its competiors and after taking this camera on our last vacation I'm sure I made the right choice. It takes incredble photos, it even does well in dimly lit rooms without the flash which was a surprise to me. Some of the other cameras feature a higher zoom but I haven't really needed to make use of the 24x yet so I wouldn't worry about pushing beyond that.Its a great easy to use camera that takes phenomal photos, this camera should fit the needs of most people who enjoy photography but don't earn their living with it.""
"20120210","5.0","So far so good","I was skeptical that such a small, lightweight camera could produce top-quality, high-resolution images. So far I'm very impressed with its powerful lens, image stabilization, RAW image capture, battery life, and flexibility. I appreciate the threaded lens, on which I've used UV and Polarizing filters. This camera will be great for travel, bike rides, and hiking. Because it's so small and light, it will come along on many adventures while the big packpack full of my more 'professional' gear will stay behind.""
"20120205","5.0","Better than Canon SX40","Tried both Panasonic FZ150 and Canon SX40, and my observation is: FZ150 wins over Canon SX40 by a good edge. The Canan SX40 (that I tried) has major AF motor noise (hissing sound) when zooming in or out (maybe due to it's heavier/powerful zoom lens - a deal breaker. FZ150 has much better motor noise, and much better auto-focus (speed and accuracy), and better picture quality (dark noise, maintain edges, depth, and dark level).When taking pictures during a video recording, SX40's video would 'break' by the picutres, while FZ150's video is smooth (both with default settings).I think FZ150 beats SX40 and the performance difference worth the $100 difference. After ~10 years using Canan point-and-shoot cameras, this time I am switching to Panasonic.[...]""
"20120129","4.0","Remarkable small things continue to amaze!!","Hello, I never do these things but I felt I must based on the fact that I have been a consumer of cameras for years and years now. All I can say is be careful what you get rid of over the years because someday you may want it back depending on something  you may not consider at the time.First, I still own the fz50 and I have to say that it is totally a better built camera than the fz150. There is actual metal on the fx50 and I can say that it just feels more rugged than the fz150. That said, I dropped its predecessor ( which I also owned) and perhaps due to its heft and of course its nemisis, gravity,  it killed the camera for good which is why I got the fz50.  So recently I got the fz150 and I have to say I do like except for a few details that I think Panasonic should have noticed but cared not to.  It seems that before companies know how to save money and they are trying to break into a newer market, there are no holds barred so to speak. Then,  a company is able to scrutinize its product then they are able to cut corners in ways that we consumers eventually notice. Such is the case in the fz150. First, and most noticably,  the camera is light which is good I suppose but I feel like it would break if I looked at it wrong. Second, some of the buttons seem a bit 'wonky' or giggly. Maybe they are supposed to be this way for reasons I don't understand. Also, the buttons are small. Much smaller than for instance the fz50. It seems to take great pictures and video and has tons of little options and menus which you could deal with for days and days if you wanted. I like the camera and will probably keep it but I just wish it were a little sturdier feeling. Another thing is that the roller knob on the back is stiff to roll and I just don't like it. Also, there is only one rolller knob when the fz50 had two which is very convenient. I think they do these things to save space in the camera. One other thing, they should have put some grippiness on the squeezer things on the lens cap.To finish, for the money, this is a great camera and don't be afraid of what has been said to deter you from getting it. If you are looking for pro results, don't get it. If you a are looking for great results with tons of options and exellent hd video, do get this camera.""
"20120128","4.0","Pretty good overall with one problem","Let me start off by saying that I use this camera primarily for it's manual features and I do not use the flash very often. The reason is that I found the auto bracketing system for exposure and white balance (the picture takes the same image three times, one at low exposure, one at mid, and one at high, and combines them into a single image) could produce brighter images in low light using a faster shutter speed than I could take in low light using a slower shutter speed. These speeds are based on my ability to keep my hand steady and take a picture without a tripod, and of course this camera has its limits before the flash is necessary. I did not get the 'soap bubbles' effect that another user seemed to experience, though I have gotten that effect on other cameras for outside shots in high humidity and I don't think there is a whole lot the camera can do since the camera can't make water droplets not reflect the light from its flash.The video quality is very very good. I was debating between buying the Panasonic TM900 with a separate still camera but I've been pretty satisfied with the video on the FZ150 that I'm just going to stick with this camera. It seems to have very low noise in low light and a big part of that is due to the fact that, not only can you adjust the ISO sensitivity while shooting video, but, if you set the camera to manual focus, you can slow the shutter speed down to 1/8th of a second. I really like that. The video is obviously a bit blurred but, if using a tripod, it is a great way to brighten the scene without increasing the ISO. With autofocus enabled, you can slow the shutter down to 1/30th of a second. The autofocus is pretty quick.And that brings me to the one problem that annoys me. When shooting video in manual mode, the camera does a good job showing you how dark the image will look as you adjust the settings in real time. However, once you are recording, depending on the lighting conditions, the LCD screen will adjust in brightness to compensate for the scene. While this can be great, this freaked me out at first because I thought that it was also changing the exposure of the video being taken, but it does not. Sometimes. The brightness does change when you zoom in and out depending on the light, and I'm not sure if that's just the light flooding the lens but the increase in brightness happens in subtle but noticeable steps, not gradual. Again, this seems to really happen while zooming, and this is while the camera is in manual video mode. The only way to get around this is to set the video mode to 'Program AE', which is stupid considering I should be able to lock the exposure completely within the manual mode. In 'Program AE' mode you cannot change the aperture or shutter and the LCD screen will still change brightness while the video does not. I have not been able to find a way to lock the LCD brightness in this regard. Also, while the LCD screen will darken while you increase the shutter speed in real time, it does nothing when changing the shutter speed while in manual photo mode. You have to press the shutter button half way down to preview the brightness at that setting. While that is not a big deal, it is an example of the kind of inconsistent performance this camera has between scenarios. While the camera is in manual focus, it is possible to blur the image while focusing beyond the infinity mark somehow...it's weird.One reason why I chose this camera over the Canon SX40 HS was due to some reviews that mentioned how useless its starry sky 30 second exposure mode was. Unfortunately, the FZ150's starry sky mode is just as useless, being locked at 200 ISO. If you can change it, I haven't seen how. The low ISO lock meant that I was able to get far brighter images using the camera's regular manual mode (which can shoot a single exposure for up to 15 seconds) with a higher ISO.Despite the odd issues with exposure changes in manual mode, which I can understand might be a deal breaker for a lot of people, I do intend to keep this camera because, for the way that I film and what I film, it shouldn't become that much of an issue all things considered. I also really like the 1/8th of a second shutter speed using manual focus. Plus, as someone who loves time lapse photography, the fact that I can plug in an intervalometer is reason enough for me to stick with it without going into a pricier DSLR. The white balance and exposure bracketing works well. For the price, this camera really is a good choice. Just understand how it behaves in relation to your shooting/filming habits. If anybody has suggestions on why my camera might be adjusting exposure in manual mode while zooming, please let me know. If I find a way to overcome that I will post it here.""
"20120127","4.0","Updated Review, sort of.","My original 'review' focused on the so-called manual for this camera, and I was (and still am) unhappy that Panasonic chose to not include one, or even make one available. This is a fine and complex camera and deserves a well-written printed manual.So much for that.  I have since purchased the camera, so let's move on.  First, I'd bet I'm not alone in how much the term 'bridge camera' irritates me. I feel that that term implies that hey, I'll just get this little make-do camera until I can step up to the plate and commit to buying a 'real' camera (read: dSLR).Years ago, I used to schlep around a bag of Nikon stuff: three F2 bodies, four lenses, lots of filters, converters, and other accessories.  When I got tired of packing 20 pounds of gear, I graduated to about the same roster of equipment, only this time using much smaller Pentax bodies and lenses.Enough already.  Those were my 'bridge cameras' from where I moved up into digital photography. There have been several cameras since then, but my latest one, after many hours of research, is this Panasonic FZ150.  It had to beat my trusted Konica-Minolta A200 that has been serving me will for several years.  The FZ150 is so good that I'll even give up the K-M A200's amazing mechanical zoom.It's interesting that it doesn't seem to compute, even to professional reviewers, that a superzoom fits many people's needs and that they are not buying one because they can't afford some big, clunky dSLR with its less-than-stellar kit lens.  They still can't resist ending their reviews with something like, 'It's a terrific camera, but don't forget that for a few dollars more, you could buy an entry-level dSLR and kit lens.' For my use, I wouldn't trade my FZ150 for ANY dSLR, entry-level or not!I'm not going to repeat all the positive attributes that have already been presented here over and over; I'll just confirm them.  One of the criteria for me to make this purchase (and keep the camera) was low-light performance.  This camera seems to make light where there is none.  I have taken amazing photos by candlelight with this thing, and once you set it up properly, there are no noise issues, either.  I use a setting of -1 on noise control and +1 on sharpness and the images continue to amaze me. My disclaimer:  I'm looking for excellent results at the 11 x 14 print level.  I am not interested in printing posters or murals from my photos.Here's a simple little event that really impressed me with the capabilities of this camera:  We have a neighbor with a pet Macaw.  He's a huge bird of amazing color.  One day we had bird-lover friends over and they really wanted to see this bird that frequents the huge redwood trees that make up our environs.  The bird opted to perch high in one of the trees, but with the sun off to the side behind him so all we could see was a small silhouette.  I got out my new camera, zoomed in tightly on the bird and took the picture in 'intelligent auto' (idiot-proof) mode and what I got was a brilliantly clear picture of the bird with all of his gorgeous colors intact.  We were all duly impressed.Anyway, please forgive the non-technical 'intro' to the up-coming 'real' review. I'll update as I get time to become more familiar with the camera.  So far, I absolutely love it.  I still wish there had been a manual with the camera and feel Panasonic is really failing their loyal customers by not even making one available as an extra-cost option. I did print the entire pdf version of the Advanced Manual on a duplex (both sides of the page) printer, trimmed the pages to 5 x 8 inches and bound them into a very nice book.  I should not have had to do that!""
"20120126","5.0","FZ150 the Swiss Penknife","I returned my FZ100 to Amazon because the price dropped and they did not want to refund anything, and while waiting for a good price I got depressed about the negative reviews, especially the one saying it is 'unloved'.The FZ150 is much better and with more features, and all reviewers seem to agree it is the best all around camera for stills/video that is also small and lightweight.I'm still planning to use the rip offs CO179EP belt pouch (2oz) so the weight for everything is under 22oz which doesn't include a spare battery (kept in jacket pocket).. I may not use the lens hood or lens cover, but am going to use a nikon clear filter for lens protection. Still going to use case logic DCB-304 belt pouch for storing in carry on hand luggage and for use in a car-it has more padding and has more room but also more bulky.I'm very pleased with the test shots -using the maximum zoom I can get sharp shots without a tripodeven with iA on which gives about a 32X zoom. (Did lean against wall though).Some test shots include a power transformer on a nearby power pole down the street, and I can read the small label on the side and see the bolt head writing. Could not tell the difference in quality between regular and iA by the way.Made in Japan.You can get a printed FZ150 advanced manual 5.5' X 8.5' with spiral binding and thick cover for $13, -download the manual and take the CD to your local printshop or office supply store. Take the official Panasonic CD if you are feeling lucky-they might not want to print it though.""
"20120119","3.0","Great features, great lens, less than stellar engineering","I researched this purchase for several months, watching videos made by others using the camera, and pictures taken. I was very impressed with the video quality and picture quality from my research. It also had all the features I wanted (RAW shooting, flip-out LCD screen, a relatively decent 'superzoom' lens and small size). I was aware of complaints of build quality, and the user interface, but I wasn't as concerned about that as with the features for the price.After using the camera for a few months, I have several things to mention.1.) The HD video quality is top-notch. Very impressive. I love the camera's ability to zoom and refocus while capturing movies. It makes my shots seem more 'cinematic'.2.) The photo quality is also excellent, pleasantly saturated colors (adjustable), although a bit grainy at the higher ISOs (not surprising given the camera's sensor size)3.) The build quality is indeed less than stellar. It seems a little more 'plasticky' than it's competitors. This probably adds to the camera's light weight (which I do like), but when I use it, I feel like I have to be more careful than with other simlar camera's I've handled. Consequently, I carry it in a well-padded bag.4.) The interface is a bit confusing and overly complicated. Panasonic should take a lesson from Canon on interface design.5.) The buttons are a little small and tightly arranged. Although I've gotten used to it, it does make using the camera feel a little cramped - not a huge issue.6.) In at least one instance, the EXIF data indicated the flash did not fire, when in fact it did.7.) This is perhaps the most troubling issue (a glaring design flaw, in my opinion), and the main reason for not giving this product a full five star rating - In some pictures using the flash, white disks or 'soap bubbles' (as the camera's manual calls them) appear superimposed over the subject. This phenomenon is mentioned in the PDF manual on page 197 (you can download a PDF of this Manual from Panasonic's website and read it yourself). I did read the PDF manual all the way through before buying the camera but I did not expect those artifacts to be so common (the shot in the manual showing the artifacts is not a picture style I typically shoot). The manual says they 'may appear as a result of the flash reflecting off of dust particles in the air'. To me, this is a major design flaw and has already ruined a number of my shots. I have never seen such artifacts from any cameras with on-board flash. At times the artifacts are subtle enough to where you don't see them until you download the pictures from the memory card to your computer and examine them - too late to re-shoot the photo without the flash. Of course, I have never seen the problem in video clips, but I have never used a video light source with the camera so I can't say if they wouldn't appear in that case.I am hopeful a firmware update will fix the EXIF and 'soap bubbles' problems. If so, this would be a five-star product, in my opinion. In the mean time, I have created my own 'DIY' flash diffuser for the pop-up flash that will hopefully eliminate or lessen the problem. If I can post a follow-up review, I will report the results of the change.""

I have asked to return it and will look for another brand similar camera. I hope I could be able to return and be refunded. It was a gift and I got completely shamed about this situation.""
"20120107","3.0","Good but with caveats","Bought this camera after reading all the reviews.  Wanted camera with wide angle to long tele for scenery and then wildlife. Clearly best reviewed non-dslr, long lens digital out there.  This wass underscored when I found there were none in stock anywhere and a 5-6 week backlog for orders.  Looked at the Canon SX40 since I am a real Canon fan.  VERY disappointed in that camera.  Felt small and cheap.  Focus would not work and that was the reason for replacing my Samsung.  Have only had this camera for a few days but here are first impressions:PRO1.  Build quality seems good.  Feels solid2.  Fastest focus I have ever experienced.  See eagle in the sky?  Snap the camera up, get it anywere in the viewfinder, push the button and you've got the picture.  Amazing.3.  LOTS of features.  Almost too many.  Will have to relearn photography again to take full advantage.4.  Piictures seem to have good detail.5.  Color seems ok but maybe a little off.6.  Lerns hood and ability to put filter over lens7.  Lens looks and feels professional8.  Good macro focussing9.  Winde angle is terrific.  We had 16 foot xmas tree (always get big trees).  This is first camera that could get the whole tree in the pic without having th back up a city block.10.  HD video seems good and can zoom in it.CONS1.  Camera is short and if you have big hands like miine it feels a little precarious2.  Biggest problem are indoor photos.  Simply does not even get close to the true color on indoor photos using IA.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.  Probably the worst indoor color match of any digitial I've had.  Just discovered this morning how to go into manual mode and make manual adjustments to white balance to approxinmate the actual colors but who wants to have to set up the camera every time you go indoors?  A major ssurprise and disappointment.4.  Flash  does not ccmpensate for exposure.  Tried to get pic of a painting we received for Xmas.  Could not find away to get the flash from putting a huge bright spot in the middle of the picture.  Tried the manual adjustments to flash and aperature to no avail.5.  NO MANUAL.  Major bummer since the online version is over 200 pages.  At a $500 price point, they  Panasonic could afford to include a print manual.6.  Camera is very complex and you will have to go to school to learn and remember its features.7.  The rotary dial on the back is small and hardd to turn8.  Don't like location of the video switch.  Hard to feel with your finger compared to the last two cameras that had it on the back where I could just activate it with my thumb.9.  The four-way button is a little small and hard to operate with regular sized hands.This sounds like I am disappointed in the camera.  Guess maybe I am a little but there are a lot of good things about it. Hate to say it, but it is heads and shoulderss above the Canon.  Probably will keep it but there are some surprising and disappointing flaws in it.  Probably biggest concern is the indoor color balance which is just unusable.""

For this test I used the cover of a computer magazine, a DVD box, and a colorful cover diskfrom the magazine.  (Geeky subjects I know!)  So I shot these at 100 iso, 1600 iso, and 3200 iso.I was amazed at the results.  Viewed on a 19' monitor I was really struggling to see any difference at all!I had to check the ISO of each photo in Irfan View to make sure I wasn't fooling myself.  Then I put them into a slideshow & viewed them from about 1 meter.  You know what they all looked pretty much perfect.  The one shot at iso 100 had a shutter speed of 1/8 sec & stilled looked sharp.  The auto white balance looked perfect too.  These were all taken without flash.

Unfortunately the one on the lens can be covered by the tulip shade when it's in the 'store' position.Aperture/Shutter shifting made easy with the thumb wheel.One button movie shooting.EXCELLENT standby battery life.Excellent LCD with pivot.Good viewfinder with diopter, but wish it had a groove around it so that a rubber gasket could be attached to protect my glasses.While others have been singing the praise of the higher ISO, I'm not so thrilled with those settings to let the camera shoot beyond ISO400 which can still be noisy with no flash indoor shoots.Great Intelligent ISO setting for when the subject is backlit, but not perfect when the backlit area is large like a window.Intelligent Zoom is useful to extend the zoom range, making the camera up to 37x and it's not detrimental to movies in particular.Multiple face recognition works great.Burst modes galore up to 12fps.Shoots compressed and uncompressed RAWTripod/monopod recommended for extended zoom and movies. The field of view is small so the slightest movement can make the subject bounce.60 fps on 1920x1080 progressive, up to 2 hours on 16Gb SD card in AVHD. Can shoot MP4The HD video is awesome. I like that you can also use special effects such as tilt shift (miniature) and Sepia et al, in Movie mode.

"20111223","3.0","Not what it seems...","As an avid photography enthusiast, I was quite excited by the prospect of getting a bridge camera that allows you to do RAW, as well as any number of other bells and whistles that have been sufficiently described by other reviewers. I did extensive research into the camera prior to purchasing it and was willing to make the switch from Canon to Panasonic as a result. I have several Canon L lenses and DSLRs, so one could say that I have a fairly high standard when it comes to image quality. That said, I realize that this is NOT a DSLR. As such, I compared the image quality to that of my 2-year old Canon Digital Elf point-and-shoot. Given that this camera is several hundred dollars more expensive than the Digital Elf, I expected there to be increased functionality and image quality. While the CONCEPT of such functionality does exist, the execution unfortunately leaves much to be desired. Here are some of my major gripes with this camera, which ultimately led me to return it and purchase the Canon SX40 instead:1) Color: This camera does NOT perform well in low light and tends to skew images to a darker, more grungy color scheme. Color quality is NOT natural at all. Having played around with various modes and options, I was hard pressed to find one that produced natural rendering. While the camera does have RAW as an option, it would be nice if you could use this camera on JPG if you want and still have the option of getting accurate colors and lighting. This is, after all, a glorified point-and-shoot, so you don't necessarily want to have to spend hours doing post-production work just to get images to look realistic. My Canon Digital Elf has far more natural color and lighting, even on auto.2) Viewfinder: The viewfinder on this camera is pretty much a novelty item, not an actual feature. The image appears blue tinted and looks as though you are looking through a cheap, fuzzy, plastic screen. Given that it is useless for composition, I'm not quite sure the purpose of its inclusion.3) Overall design: Call me crazy, but this camera just looks cheap. It has a plastic aesthetic that doesn't do it's $450 justice.4) Mac compatibility: Transferring videos to my mac was not necessarily straightforward. It is doable, but far more of a hassle than with any of my prior Canon cameras. It's not a deal-breaker, but it is still a bit frustrating when you combine it with some of the other irritants.OVERALL: GET THE CANON SX40 OR AN ENTRY-LEVEL DSLRIf you want the IDEA of good features, then this camera is for you. However, the execution is far from ideal. Now, some of this may be personal preference. I know that Panasonic is known for shooting slightly cooler toned images, whereas Canon is warmer. However, I must say that I tried my Panasonic in numerous different types of light and was hard pressed to get accurate color. I have since exchanged this camera for the Canon SX40 and am happy I did. At $100 cheaper, it may not shoot RAW, but the images it does shoot are infinitely more true-to-life. The auto focus seems a tad slower than the Panasonic, but the ultimate image seems sharper and cleaner.So, I think it depends on what you are wanting. If you are someone that is looking for a true bridge camera that accurately renders color, then I'd say go with the Canon SX40. If you are wanting features such as the ability to shoot RAW, then pay the extra money and get an entry-level DSLR. You'll be glad you did.""
"20111220","4.0","Very nice camera","Pros: threaded for filters, on/off switch, view finderCons: Poor documentation, no play-only settingAfter the usual searches of the usual sources for info/recommendations on the usual brands, I ended up with something entirely different. Just happened across a review of the Lumix and was hooked. I haven't tried everything yet, but I mostly like what I have tried so far.The first thing I noticed on the camera was a real on/off switch, NOT a button! Love that. Then I noticed the lens was threaded for filters, just like a 'real' camera. Nice thing is, it's 52mm, which is the filter size of my old 35mm camera, so I had a UV filter ready to be used. I like the view finder, I sometimes prefer to use same, and it's optically compensated. The digital display is large and clear and can be swiveled in various directions, making it easy to get those not-head-on shots. And when it's not being used, it can be flipped around so it's protected in transit. It can shoot RAW format which, while I rarely need it, is definitely nice to have for certain photos. Ditto for its 3D ability. It has all sorts of high-speed options and you can choose how long (or not at all) you want an image to display after you take the shot.I've found only a few annoyances so far. The big one is the (now standard) lack of a real manual. Hard to believe, Panasonic, but not everyone has a computer! And no computer is as handy to carry in my pocket as a manual would be. The other annoying thing is there's no play-only setting to look at your photos. In other words, you must power up the camera in record mode, have the lens extend and then press a button to switch to play mode. This extra in and out wastes battery power. Minor annoyances are interface related. The camera comes with a USB cable but it's too short to be very practical. And, while it has HDMI capability, the camera does not include a cable for same.I'll try to post a follow-up after I've used the camera for a while. I expect I'll be quite happy with it.""
"20111216","4.0","Great walk around camera","Practical things: (1) It has a viewfinder that works great; (2) it is small and light. (3) Yes, people, it has a GREAT lens. The quality of glass is in direct relationship to the money you spend. For a $500 camera, you're getting the best for your money. I use the camera to walk around in areas where I do not want to take my D90. Please realize that I do not expect this little camera to match my D90 quality but for shots that are of better quality than my smaller DMC ZS5. In fact, I would say that the FZ150 will take great tourist/travel photos. It is not great in low light conditions but it is not poor either. I really like the fact that it has a viewfinder because, although the back screen is large and nice, in conditions of extreme light I cannot see anything. I use the back scree for videos. On the other hand, I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 for two reasons: the lens cap sucks and the sunshade too. Both for the same reason: they are clumsy to put on and off. The cap is worse than the shade. Panasonic gives you a thin wire to hang the cap but this wire is mother of all problems because after you put it in the cap it is almost imposible to keep the cap in place. Even more, you cannot use both together, that is, either you use the shade or you use the cap. Otherwise the cap will be getting off all the time. My solution: I got a filter and forget about the cap but you would agree with me that this is a not a real solution.""
"20111215","5.0","Pretty much the best "bridge" camera right now","I gave this camera 5 stars, based on my experience with other superzooms or 'bridge' cameras.If you're reading this review, you probably are already familiar with its features. By the time you learn to use them all, the camera will be a couple years old, and there will be something else. But it will take something truly exceptional to unseat this one. I just used mine at our office Christmas party, and I used the Manual mode to capture the true color of all the lights. Until you try Manual, or the other creative control settings like Aperture and Shutter priority, you can't fully appreciate what this camera can do. I love the little bar at the bottom of the screen in manual mode that lets you see the exposure level (+/- 2 stops) as you scan around the scene. But that's just one of what seems like hundreds of features. All I can say is buy one, and then experiment. Every time I pick mine up, I find something new.Someone said this is not supposed to be a video camera. But isn't THAT one of the main reasons for buying a digital camera with video? It's like hunting: years ago they made rifles that also had a shotgun barrel under the rifle barrel - you never knew which one you'd need in the field. Well, THAT'S the reason for having a combination still and video camera - sometimes you need a camera, and sometimes a camcorder. With this one, you can truly carry just one lightweight device.I loved the AVCHD on my FZ100, but having both 1080p AVCHD and H.264 Mpeg4 in the same camera is a real deal-maker for me. The AVCHD is as smooth and clear as a camcorder, and the H.264 lets me take low-light hi-res videos that play on a computer. And the 1080p H.264 on this camera blows away the 1080p on my Nikon 8100. Rather than rave on, let me just summarize what I think are some pros and cons:Pros:  - Battery meter works with 'aftermarket' batteries as well as Panasonic.  - Both AVCHD and H.264 Mpeg4 video recording in 1080p mode.  - True dedicated hot shoe, compatible with Panasonic and Olympus flashes  (most, anyway).  - Lightning fast burst modes: faster than the FZ100, and it smokes the SX40HS.  My sports pictures amaze people.  - New sensor works better in low light. Pictures are good up to ISO 1600.  - Q Menu button allows for quick setting changes. This makes the camera more  fun to use.  - The Leica lens is more accurate than other brands. Very little chromatic  aberration (green & purple fringing) at the edges of the pictures.  - IQ mode works well enough that my family can also use this. Well, maybe that  should be listed under 'Cons.'Cons:  - Tele/Wide button on the lens barrel is too close to the Macro/AF/Manual  focus slider switch. It's easy to accidentally move that slide switch  while using the tele/wide button, so I just don't use it.  - As with the FZ100, the electronic eyepiece viewfinder isn't as good as it  could be, although I like the diopter eye correction wheel on the side.In a nutshell, this camera gives me features and results that are close enough to an entry-level DSLR that I no longer pour over the Sunday ads, trying to find a special on DSLRs like the Rebel T3i or the Nikin 5100. So I'm keeping it!""
"20111214","5.0","Great Proconsumer Point and Shoot Zoom","After readng a number of reviews on proconsumer point and shoot zoom cameras, I choose the FZ 150.  My prior proconsumer was the Nikon E8800 zoom.  the camera provided sharp outdoor pictures but struggled to focus and capture indoor shots.  The FZ 150 has numerous bells and whistles.  Once you master the settings you will find that this camera takes fast sharp pictures in all lighting conditions.  For example, taking a portrait, there are numerous combinations of settings that are available.  The bottom line - This is not a camera for someone who just wants to just point and shoot.  This is a very creative camera and only is limited by the photographer.""
"20111212","4.0","Wonderful features, slightly disappointing results","Let's get one thing straight. What you (should) look for in a camera first is picture quality, then features. My mistake was buying this solely on the features...mainly the incredible zoom, raw support, excellent video recording, large flash, and fast shutter speed. Overall, I would say picture quality is good. I was  disappointed with the somewhat inconsistent results. Sometimes pictures are sharp, other times they are not. Low light shots are decent. The noise reduction is good, but sharpness just isn't what I was hoping for. I had the Lumix DMC-LX3 and really thought the picture quality was better. I returned it due to a defect (pictures were coming out green above ISO 200) and got this instead. I would say the LX3 had sharper images, but didn't have the zoom I was looking for.Do not buy this if you don't know how to use manual controls. I still think it's a great camera, but that's mostly due to the feature set and not image quality. However, having so many of these features (such as zoom) can help get shots and results you couldn't in a more compact camera. Bottom line is pictures can come out good, but may require some work. Raw mode is a must...don't expect to snap in jpg and keep all your results. I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could...but I am giving it 4 since 3 is not really fair. It really is a great camera, just wish the results were more consistent.""
"20111212","4.0","A great camera for beginners and amateurs of photography.","The image quality and the perfect treatment of RAW capture, make it the perfect choice for users who make the leap from compact cameras to SLR type cameras. Many people believe that this leap intermediate options 'bridge' are useless, indicating that the correct choice would be an SLR. However, in this case I think is right, the option of feeling in his hands the handling of a compact and well made the favors of a DSLR without spending much money. Whether intelligent auto mode or full manual control, flexibility in taking pictures cover a wide range of possibilities, though, taking a longer or less long and devoted to studying the manual and test every of the options. 'Things to be improved? sure, why not?. The optical viewfinder would be a nice material to support the eye, and the wheel of functions (control A/V and priorities of speed and aperture control) may have a touch more pleasant way. The folding display is a success, and truly spectacular optical zoom. In my view the purchase of this camera has been a success.""
