As soon as she determined the need for a micro card, she had to have it, and she had to have it now.  I just kind of ignored her until we went to Wal-Mart and I found the SanDisk micro card in our shopping cart.  At that point I suggested we put off the purchase until I had an opportunity to compare prices on the Internet.  She hesitantly agreed, and I'm sure glad she did.  I found the exact same SanDisk micro card with adapter at Amazon.com for about half the price we would have paid at Wal-Mart.  I combined my purchase with another 'must have' item in order to qualify for free shipping, and within a week my wife had her micro disk.  I was happy, more importantly my wife was happy, and most importantly my bank account was happy.  As a result, I highly recommend this product.""

With the adapter, it's just as good as the regular size but I can inter-change as needed with all my toys. Also, if I misplace an adapter, the micro still works in another--even a different brand.Now, I'm seriously considering replacing the thumb drives for my music and picture libraries with microSDs, just for the convenience of the smaller size. Plus, the prices are falling almost daily.If you're like me, with multiple toys that call for different sized SD's, you can't go wrong with a micro with an adapter.""

I can't fault the seller for thinking it was nothing but an upgrade, as the Class rating doesn't consider small-block random writes (which were acceptable), but this spec may possibly be important if you're running your OS from the actual card (Nook Color CM7 from SD, etc).  Benchmark is below for the card, and was taken on an internal card reader that's connected via USB to my mobo, prior to having written any data to the card.  The card didn't quite hit the Class-4 promise of 4 MB/s sequential write speed--luckily that's not important for my usage, besides which, the item is listed as Class 2, and the card does exceed Class 2 specs.

I can even store a few books-on-tape on the micro disc, and then use the same disk in my MP3 player to listen to a book while I walk.Very versatile!  I love the freedom it gives me to do my computing wherever I want without having to lug a computer around with me.""

My boyfriend and I both have the enV touch - a multimedia phone that comes with virtually no extra storage space.  I got one of these micro SDHC cards for each of us to use and we love them.  I strongly recommend grabbing one of these for your phone - it instantly adds tons of space for pics, vids, music, etc.  You can also use it to store music and vids your MP3 player.  For 8 GB of storage, this is a great price - you can't go wrong.  In my experience, SanDisk is a trustworthy and reliable brand.This memory card comes with an adapter that works well if you want to use in your camera.  If you will be frequently tranferring data to/from your micro SDHC and computer, then I strongly recommend grabbing a micro SDHC card reader to use - they are inexpensive and make using your memory card quick and easy.

This item is so versatile.I'm using mine in my Blackberry and even though it reads it as only a 4GB, I haven't had any problems.  I have been told that this happens a lot in phones.  They see it only as a certain amount that the company has 'maxed' on the device (probably because an 8GB didn't exist when it was manufactured), but I've loaded all kinds of photos and music onto it and have had no problems.

"20120218","2.0","SD Adaptor does not work!","Shipping was amazingly fast. However, I'm not totally satisfied with the item. Yeah, it comes with the SD Adapter, but I can't use it because it says the SD card is write-protected. I can't save things in it or anything. I can only use the SD card when it is in my phone/camera and I plug my device via USB cable..""

"20120209","2.0","the adapter does not work","the micro sd works but the adapter does not. I have contacted the seller and he has sent me another adapter but the second one does not work as well. I was contemplating a refund but the Seller was prompt on getting back to me and did attempt to resolve the issue.  So I guess I will just keep the micro SD card and call it even.But if you bought this product for the sole purpose of using the adapter you may want to think it over.""
"20120208","5.0","perfect 8gb wow class 4!","Ya this is perfect for you Boost mobile phones and Virgin mobile because I tried it on these device.wow I was expecting a class 2 for $6.32 but I got a Class 4 8gb wow its worth way more and its the real deal. No bootleg, its not fake its a real sandisk 8gb class 4 .. it comes realy in a (7.4gb) micro sd card form. So that a normal genuine msdc from SanDisk 8gb class 4 wow. I took back my 4gb class 2 msdc Sandisk from radio shack that cost me $12.99+tax way worth it.. so now with my money back from radio shack I'm buying more of these high quality product... trust this dealer only""
"20120207","5.0","Got more than I expected!","When my MicroSD card arrived, I noticed that the invoice said it was class 2, and then I was worried that I had ordered the wrong thing, and that it would be slower than the 2 GB card in my Evo Shift. However, I looked at the card and it is actually class 4! I tested it, and sure enough, I was able to write a 51-MB file in about 12 seconds. The little case locks, BTW. So far, it is working just fine.""

"20120205","1.0","The SD broke in 2 days!","The SD I received was different from the picture shown. In the picture, there are SANDISK LOGO, but there is no SANDISK LOGO on the  SD card I received.I doubt the SD card was made by SANDISK.  Every authentic SANDISK SD should have SANDISK Logo on it.The quality of the SD CARD was very poor, it broke in 2days.The seller's customer service was very very bad. Not helpful at all.""
"20120204","4.0","Good card but no case","I really like the card, it works very well and is cheap. The only bad thing about it is that it shows that it comes with a case to put the card in on the picture but when I got my package, I did not recieve a case with it.....""

"20120114","3.0","works, but not on all computers?","Just got this the other day to transfer things off my microSD card from my old phones. While it worked nicely on one of my laptops, the SD adapter wasn't recognized on my other computer, or if using a USB adapter. Not sure why, but wish it just worked like a normal SD card.""
"20120113","4.0","Works great","It's amazing! It slices, it dices. It purees. Oh wait, wrong review. It stores data! OOOOHH! It lets you then read that data back! AAAAHHHHH! It's small and yet BIG (as far as storage goes)! KA-POW! And best of all it was cheap! Not cheap as in cheap dollar store made in Saskatchewan cheap. Cheap as in 'that's usually expensive but now it's not!' cheap. What more could you want in a small piece of plastic that stores data? Buy one today and we'll throw in a FREE lifetime supply of SMILES. Or at least a couple days worth. Offer not available in all areas.""
"20120113","1.0","Not what was advertised, very unhappy","Using a seller through Amazon, I was under the impression that I was buying the real thing.  Not so. The SanDisk label was wrong (it should be red and blue, but was all red). It, and the small plastic case look NOTHING like the image on this listing.  The micro SD card doesn't even lock into the plastic case like a real SanDisk product shown in the listing. And the gold seal on the back of the card doesn't have markings.It didn't arrive in original packaging, just the small plastic SDHC card flip case in a brown envelope.  The microchip did not work. Evidently, this same thing has happened to a number of other buyers.I have no one to blame but myself for not paying attention to the reviews.Luckily, I'm out less than ten dollars.I have bought online for years, and this has been the first transaction where something has not been as advertised and apprears to be not what it's supposed to be.I CANNOT recommend this seller, and my one (1) star rating should not be construed as any type of approval or recommendation.""

"20120110","5.0","Works Great!","Not much to review about here. Mechanically it fits good and no problems, microSDHC card fits great into the device and the SD adapter as well as the SD adapter fitting into the card reader. No problems with storing or retrieving data. Works great, bought 4 of them.""
"20120110","3.0","make sure you read the fine print!!","I feel the picture and posting title of the item are a bit misleading, it shows and states that the item is a SanDisk microSDHC 8gb class 2 card with the SD adapter (SDSDQ-8192). But I only received a used 8gb micro sd card, there was no SD adapter or even a plastic case. I contacted the sellor and they pointed out that in the product description it clearly stated the SD adapter was not included and that the card was used. On the good side the card works fine and I did learn an important lesson:  make sure to read the actual product description, because the posting title and picture may not be  what you are actually buying.""
