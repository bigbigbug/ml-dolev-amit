"20120410","5.0","Great Case","Amazon offered this as a companion product when I purchased my Sony DSC-H70 Cybershot. It says it's for Slim Cybershot cameras, and I thought my camera was pretty slim. But Slim is part of the name of the camera, I guess, not just an adjective, because my camera was a little too long, and the velcro closure couldn't close. For the correct camera, I think this would be a very good case.""

"20120305","5.0","Best protection","I purchased the Sony Bloggie and thought this would be a good way to protect my new investment. Unfortunately, the case is a bit too small length-wise. I already have a Sony Cyber Shot camera so it didn't go to waste. This case is a better fit for the Cyber Shot camera than the mini video recorder. The video recorder is too long to fit properly in this case. I keep my camera in my purse at all times to capture what life has to offer. But when you do this, sometimes the power button gets hit and you get a dead camera battery. The bottom of my camera where the battery/sd card slot is sometimes comes open too. This case solved all the issues my purse was causing. Couldn't be happier.""
"20120128","4.0","Tight fit for Sony DSC-H70","I needed a cheap small case for my wife's new Christmas present, a DSC-H70. This fit the bill of being inexpensive, and small. We have a bigger case to fit chargers and batteries and such, but she wanted a small case to fit in her purse. The case looks nice, but the DSC-H70 is a touch bit too long. The Velcro flap has to be pulled down pretty tight to make it stay closed. Like I said, it fits, but it is pretty tight. I'd be willing to bet that after some time it might fit better, but new out of the box, it is tight. Width and thickness is good, just the length is a bit off for this DSC-H70.Other then the fit, it is a nice cheap case. The zipper pouch on the front is big enough for another card, but not big enough for an extra battery. The snap closure belt loop on the back seems useless to me  - as well as the 'D ring' loop on the top.I did not give this case 5 stars because the fit is not exact. I understand this is billed as a universal style case (and it was like 8 bucks), but it says it fits my camera; and while it does fit, it fits tight, not exact.""

At first, this case was perfect, the size, the extra pocket for 1 extra Memory Stick and closed belt loop. Then one day, I took out my camera to find that the screen was cracked!What did this? I handle all of my electronics with care. In my possession, you will find PS2, televisions, other digital camera's in immaculate condition (dust free, smoke free, white glove treatment!). Steamed that I just losted my favorite discontinued camera, I wondered what may have cause this. Was it cheap parts? Defect?How could it be cheap parts? This camera lasted me about 1.5 years with no problems and is very sturdy, not to mention was still made in Japan. So I walked myself the day's event. Found it!What caused my camera's screen to break was the case's belt loop's snap button. Depending on where the screen is, if it's on the other side where the snap button is (meaning you have the camera's screen closest to you and the len's outward), with the soft case, you have a chance of applying pressure points on the inside of the case with the snap button. CRACK! even with the slightest bend of your body if looped on your belt or placed in purse.Sad to say I lost my $399 camera due to a cracked and bled screen with Sony's own protection case. WTF! It was one of the saddest days in my digital life. But made me realize to never spend top dollar again with Sony.""
"20100105","4.0","Suitable for a sony w290","The sony w 290 fits snugly in this case.

The strap on the back is attached by a magnetic button and i would not trust it to hold on to my belt.  Even if I did the whole thing is just to big and bulky for that.

"20090509","4.0","Bought it for a Sony DSC-W150","If you are like me, when you read the reviews here to select a camera case, it was quite confusing based on what I found...I never could decipher if the camera I had would fit this case. I paid about $10 and received free shipping.Here we go, I have a Sony DSC-W150 (3 3/4 x 2 3/8 x 1 3/16). The inside is made of a soft material that won't scratch any of the camera's surfaces on either side. Outside it's that tough, tight knit nylon that will hold up forever. It has no long shoulder strap. It has a sewn-in belt loop that runs the length of the whole backside of the case with a metal loop at the top. It has a little zipper pouch in the front that I store an extra battery, the memory stick adapter, and an extra memory stick and there is no unsightly bulge. The camera fits perfectly width wise. When you insert the camera into the case, length wise, it sticks out about 1' above the sides and a 1/4' above the front. NOW, if you have the wrist strap attached to your camera, you have to fold it up at the top of the camera before you close it and get the Velcro to securely attach...which it does about half way up the Velcro patch attached to the front.My opinion is that this is about as small a case you can get for this size camera and still hold what you need to go out. The whole thing fit into my cargo pocket of my shorts. Keep in mind, even if you don't use it to take to an event, because the camera is so small, you still need something to store the camera in around the house and to throw in the car. I've taken it to a ball game and to Universal Studios, taken the camera out of the case and just put it in my pocket and returned it to the case when we got back into the car.For the money, it's well worth it. I rated it 4 Stars because nothing is perfect and 5 Stars would have to exceed my expectations.I hope this helps some you folks out.""

Another reviewer suggested that this case was a little 'snug' for his Cyber-shot camera (a different model), and the pictures he posted made me unsure whether the case would be a good fit.The fit is perfect, and the case is perfect to protect the phone. With the phone in the case, the zippered compartment at the front (under the flap) will hold a spare battery with no problem.The case is lightweight, and should easily protect the camera from a reasonable drop. It has a D ring at the top/rear of the case which you could use to attach the case to something with a carabiner; it also has a loop that is sewn into the top/rear of the case and snaps to the bottom-rear of the case -- this loop could be used as a wrist strap, or you might use the loop to attach the case to your belt (but you would want to run your belt through the loop and not between the case and the loop because the snap could come undone without your realizing it and 'goodbye camera').I strongly believe this case is preferable to the Sony LCS-CSQ/B case for my camera.""

The stiff back of the case does wonders for protecting the screen (if you insert the camera with the screen facing the back of the case); and while the external zippered pocket may be good for holding an extra memory stick, I wouldn't recommend putting an extra battery in it, as there would be some difficulty in removing it.All in all, this a great case for protecting your digital camera; without costing an arm and a leg.""

(DSC-W120).It is absoultely tiny. Couldn't even get the camera in it..no way! My son was extreamly dissapointed as its a present for today (Christmas day)!I just got online and ordered THIS ONE: (Precision Design Compact Digital Padded Carrying Case for Sony Cybershot DSC-T2, T70, T77, T100, T300, T500, T700, W35, W80, W90, W120, W130, W150, W1)Here's hoping it will be big enough!""
"20081221","4.0","Great fitting case, but beware the snap...","I love this case for holding my DSC-T100. The soft lining prevents scratches and I can get to the camera quickly with the Velcro closed top flap. My main concern (and it could be a big one if you aren't careful) is that Sony chose to use a cheap button snap for the belt loop. it doesn't require a lot of stress on the snap for it to open up and for the case to fall away. This happened to me several weeks ago at a hockey game and I was relieved that my camera wasn't in the case when it fell away. Sony should have used a better mechanism for closing the belt loop. Still, I liked the case so much that I went ahead and bought the same case to replace the one I lost.""

However, I would be more please if the case were a touch larger. The camera alone is a tight squeeze to fit into the case and renders the small zippered pocket is useless.

"20081101","4.0","Excellent value, nicely padded, and too bulky for jeans","Great price! Excellent padding! Excellent finish and workmanship! Those are the pros. The only disadvantage is that I wanted a slim case to protect my camera's nice finish, something to tuck into my pocket. I definitely can't do it with this camera, so I was disappointed with it overall. However, my wife loves it, because she doesn't carry the camera, and said that it was nicely padded and would keep the camera safe, and that if she saw it in a store, she would purchase it. Ok then, so we kept it - I would have given it 5 stars, but there are small openings on the side of the case through which you can see the camera. If you are traveling in places where it rains excessively, and you have this on your belt, I would be concerned about water seeping in. But, for under $9, you can't beat this case!""

"20080705","5.0","Perfect for Sony DSC-W170","I read a large number of customer evaluations before buying this for my Sony Cybershot DSC-W170 digital camera, which it fits perfectly.  Regarding the little zipper pocket in front, it can hold either a spare memory chip or a spare Sony NP-BG1 battery (which fits that camera) but not both.  The case is very trim and well-made, a bargain for the $7.50 I paid for it.  The only gripe I have is that the attachment strap on the back of the case should be wider.  The attachment strap has an interesting design however, which allows you of the choice of snapping it over your belt (with a substantial snap) or threading your belt through it, which would definitely be better for risky travel situations where somebody might try to grab the camera, case and all.  If you wear it at your waist in front of you, in the latter situation you can unsnap it when you sit down in a bus or restaurant and it frees the camera from your belt without actually detaching it from your belt.  The camera sits on your lap on a secure nylon webbing tether about 5' long.  I would consider this a very secure arrangement on vacation in a country where thieves are present, and I have not seen this particular design on any other camera case anywhere.  Regarding whether the case is 'too tight' for a Cybershot-size camera, I observe that this is a 'soft' case which will stretch and loosen up over time, so I wouldn't want it much larger. It has a very nice, soft, velvety interior that won't scratch the camera, whether or not you put a spare battery in the front zipper compartment.""
"20080705","4.0","Good for just the camera","I got this case for my Sony DSC-W170.  The camera fits almost perfectly and is held tight.  The camera stayed in while I held it upside down with the flap open.  With the 170 the extra pocket is almost a mute point.  I put my spare battery (plastic case and all) in it and then could hardly get the camera in and the case closed, it was pretty much the same without the plastic case.  An extra memory card would probably fit ok though.  The case seems well constructed enough to help the camera survive a small fall and even does a decent job of shielding the entire camera.""

No, it's not going to save your camera if you run over it in the car or drop it off a cliff, but it should withstand minor accidents.

It makes my camera go from less than 1 inch thick to almost 2 inches thick, which is not so good for carrying in my little purses.  but besides that its great.  when i need to put it in a smaller purse I just use my iPod sock, which fits it perfectly with no added width!""

I put it in the junk drawer immediately - if it were more expensive, I'd take the time to return it.  Problem is case doubles size of the camera for no good reason and that changes it from a compact thing that fits anywhere to something that is not.  I think what you really want is a very soft case with shock absorbant qualities (like neoprene used in diving suits) vs. this case which has a lot of structure and heavy seams, etc. made of ballistic nylon fabric.

Beacuse of the large screen on T-100 you need to have a case to protect the camera. The inside of the case is soft and avoids any scraches to the LCD screen. The convenient belt clip allow the user to access camera very easy and fast, makes your hands free not to carry the camera all the time. A small zipped section in the front helps you store extra memory card or adaptor. I took this with me to my trip to Tokyo. I felt this is a great buy and a great price at Amazon. com.

"20111128","5.0","Perfect Protection","I have just purchased another Sony Cyber-shot but wanted the same case I have for my original DSC-W150. I love this case! The options of belt loop attachment with the snap strap or threading a belt through allow me to choose the security level I need while leaving my front jeans pocket free for car keys and change (both of which would scratch my camera). The metal d-ring at the top of the case provides a third option, allowing use of your own caribiner or other snap on clip. And yes, it protects the camera well if dropped. I've accidentally dropped the case with the camera in it a few times and the camera has never been damaged.The velcro flap allows me to quickly get the camera out of the case. Zippers are too slow if your photo op is about to disappear! The little zip pocket on the front holds 2 pro duo chips or a spare battery easily, but would be hard pressed to hold a chip and a battery unless the battery is one of the new super slim kind.This case will not slip into a pocket but since the idea is to protect the camera from damage, I'm okay with that. This is a bargain at 1/3 the price of other Sony cases that do not provide nearly the protection. I think you'll be pleased with this case for your camera, too.""

It says it's for Slim Cybershot cameras, and I thought my camera was pretty slim.  But Slim is part of the name of the camera, I guess, not just an adjective, because my camera was a little too long, and the velcro closure couldn't close.  For the correct camera, I think this would be a very good case.""

"20111011","3.0","OK for W560","This case fits my DSC-W560, though because it is designed for many cameras in mind, the camera will stick out of the pocket so that even if the flap will close correctly, part of the camera is exposed.

"20070417","4.0","Does the job just fine","I bought this soft case for my recently acquired Sony DSC-T100.  The case fits like a glove.  It has a velcro front tab closure that works (no surprise).  There is a belt loop on the back that fastens with a stiff snap at the bottom (can go through something stationary like a belt loop).  It's got a convenient D-ring for attachment to a pack clip or carabiner, and it has a tiny zippered compartment capable of holding a few spare memory cards or a spare battery (both would be tight).  The case is padded lightly but surely all over.  The top flap is wide enough and sturdy enough on the edges to protect the case's contents if it should fall on something hard like tile or concrete.  And it looks OK, too.  I'm of two minds about the Sony logo on the front -- sometimes I think it's safer to not advertise what's inside a case, but, hey, it's their product and they seem really fixated on getting their name on EVERYTHING possible.  It seems like it's only a matter of time until Sony and Starbucks duke it out in a takeover battle.""

It's very soft inside so you don't have to worry about scratches and it opens wide so you don't have to worry about the zipper scratching anything also. The only problem was there wasn't an extension for the handle, but you can always buy one.

The fit is neither too small nor too large. Check out the dimensions if it may fit other sony cameras. But for the T-10, it is perfect.

I will probably invest in a  bigger case so I can fit more items in it, like pictures, adaptor for computer, battery charger, memory stick, etc.  Other than that it works out fine for me.""
"20061111","5.0","Perfect Choice","This item fits the camera very well and provides a good level of protection.

"20061009","5.0","Great for DSC-T9","The previous two reviewers failed to see that more than one seller offered this case.  I bought it after the first complaint-about-shipping-review for under $13 from antonline through amazon.I was worried about buying it since the other reviewers failed to confirm whether or not you can fit the battery in the front pouch.  I can fit a spare battery, with plastic case, inside there with a Cybershot DSC-T9 no problem (and yes, you can squeeze a memory stick duo in there, except you might want to keep the battery's plastic case off for that).The case felt a bit large for me and I just don't like carrying things on my belt so I added a hook to the other end of the case (very easy to do) and then a strap from another camera case.  This thing fits perfect with the strap around my neck and the case comfortably at the side, or however anyone wants to wear it.I uploaded photos of the battery fitting and my added strap to amazon's customer images for those curious.  If you find a seller without the $50 shipping problem (which you will on amazon) then go ahead, you can't get a better case for the DSC-T9 and maybe entire DSC-T series.""

There's also a small zippered pouch on the inside front that you can put an extra memorystick or even battery. The only thing that could make this case even better would be a clip for those who don't wear belts but still wear pants.""
"20060603","5.0","Great case that fits Sony camera DSC-W50, W70 serie","I bought this case for my wife's new Sony DSC-W70 camera and she loves it. It is pretty slick and fits the camera just tight and right.  Its plush interior foam pad offers plenty of protection.  I'd say that the camera would suffer litlle damage when dropped.  The exterior case is made with a high quality material that not only looks good but will also last for years.  The whole thing stays small enough to be carried in my wife's purse easily.  Keep in mind that its overall thickness is about 1.5 inch (while the camera is just 0.5 inch) so it won't fit comfortably in any pant/shirt pocket though.  If this is what you want, then probably get the leather case model without foam instead.  On the other hand, we like the extra protection, zippered pocket, the handy belt loop and the unbeattable price/quality/look.""

This one is a real keeper!!!!!!!""
"20060405","5.0","Perfect for the my camera, and at a great price!!!","I just purchased the new Sony DSC-W50 and wanted a case to protect it. This is a great case in my opinion. Soft and plush inside, but firm and protective on the outside. The camera is held firmly in place from the moment you first slide it in the pocket. The additional small zippered pocket on the outside is handy for extra memory sticks, or maybe even an extra battery. The belt loop is very handy, and there is even a metal ring so that you can attach it to a carabiner or something of the like if desired. However, what I like most is that it will protect your investment and look good doing it. I think it's one of the best buys out there. It can be had for less than $15 delivered from several sellers through Amazon.""

I was looking for a small compact camera case that still have some type of padding or support.  While at the store, I compared the case meant for the Canon to many others.  I picked up this one mainly because it had much more protection compared to the Canon case, and it came with an extra zipper in the front, perfect for that extra memory card/battery you need to carry around.  Even the inner lining of the case is exceptional, with fuzzy material soft enough not to scratch the LCD screen.  My SD300 fits perfectly in the case, and although they may not be the same brand, it definitely was a great buy.""

There is a small front pocket for a battery/camera card. I was just able to squeeze the plastic battery container in the pocket. (The battery is the Sony Type G Rechargeable Li-Ion) It is tight, but doable. On the back of the carrier is a small strap that can be used as a wrist strap, or snapped down on the case so you can slide it onto a belt. There is also a strong metal ring on the back, so I used a small spring snap fastener to hook it to my belt loop since I don't wear a belt. It worked great.I want the things I tote to be small, light, and less cumbersome than what I've used in the past. This little case is all those things.

Beware the customer photos - the selling point for me was the apparent shoulder strap but, the description clearly states 'belt loop' which I'll never use because I don't wear a belt.

The only strap is the camera strap which protrudes from the case if you let it.I would recommend buying a different case if you need to carry such optional equipment.
