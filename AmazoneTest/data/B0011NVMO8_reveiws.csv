"20120602","4.0","Great focal range as well as focusing speed as long as you know its limitations","Specified use:  Taking candid pictures of family (especially my grandaughter) without being close.  Pictures will be taken outside (pools, parks and backyards) typically with great to good lighting.  If you are looking to take pictures in this type of environment (100-200 ISO and aperture of 6.5+) then this should be a lense to consider due to low cost, good feel/balance and lightweight. While my primes are sharper this lense is a great compromise for range and light weight.  BTW, I saw others with great lenses (Canon and Nikon) for capturing the moment (speed and sharpness)...but they were alot more uncomfortable by the end of the graduation program due to the weight and unexpected heat wave that blanketed the football field which was not foreseen (see background section).A little Background:  I purchased various lenses on May 31, 2012 before a graduation ceremony and was immediately put to work taking the grad pics.  All went well even without first hand experience about the limitations (see recommendations for more detail) of the lense (first time use).  Plenty of light (although some extreme backlit situation was a challenge) allowed me to play with various aperture setting to see what would look best for this shooting situation.  At 100-200 ISO (depending on direct sunshine or in shadow areas) and shooting at 6.5+ apertures produced some very stunning and sharp results.  I took about 350 pics with about 10 that was not useable (blur or exposure problem since this is the first time I used this particular lense).  Handling and balance is great.  Burst shots (3-5) was amazing with no lens creep (some of the shots had extreme upward/downward angles).  Focusing was fast (remember that I did not encounter dim or evening lighting), quiet (compared to 18-55 and 50 mm 1.8) and sharp. As the heat passed 85 degrees with full sunlight into our faces, I had to go further out to secure better shooting opportunities/angles (1.6 crop with 250mm really helped in this regard) with virtually no blurred shots...impressive for first time use.Highly recommended, but know its limitations which are: slow focusing in dim lighting (still manageable or manual focus if you don't want the hunting), some softness (center is still sharp and I typically crop using thirds guidlines), and FT manual focusing not available (you need to switch from AF to MF). Even with the limitations noted here, it is a great lense coupled with my Canon 20D and certainly worth a look.""
"20120527","3.0","Maybe for You...NOT for me.","I purchased this lens for use on my Canon T2i to take photos during the day of wildlife and boats on the water.  I have used the 17-55 kit lens and found it to reasonably sharp though it lacked contrast.  With the 55-250 I found that the images were not sharp beyond 200 with some barrel distortion below 100mm.  These made it unacceptable to my standards.  I like tack sharp images just getting the shot is not good enough...it must be clear too.  I have been using Canon autofocus cameras since they were introduced and I have owned at least 5 film bodies and four digital bodies.The long lenses I have were the old type without image stabilization so I thought hey, for this kind of money why not give this lens a try  Well, save your money and buy a better lens if you want an acceptable image that you can print at 16 by 20. However, if you take snapshots and capture memories of your kids and not photographs to be used as art...this lens is fine but don't pay more than 175 for it.""
"20120525","5.0","Life through a longer lense","My new Canon telephoto lens is exactly what I hoped. The zoom in long enough to shoot birds and flowers, but light weight enough for me to handle.""
"20120515","4.0","Decent versatile lens if you have realistic expectations","I bought this lens because I wanted a single walk-around lens that would cover a broad zoom range, and in that capacity it performs well. I knew I would sacrifice some quality for the sake of versatility, which is certainly true, but the lens is still able to produce good quality images.The obvious: This is not an L series lens, so build quality is noticeably cheaper. Image quality is not as great as an L series or as a Primal lens.Pros: A very light lens, easy to carry around. The zoom range is pretty nice, and if you have a 18-55 kit lens, it complements pretty well, on a crop frame the long end of the zoom is pretty long (around 400mm equivalent on full frame) which probably suits most tele-photo needs, and the shorter-mid zooms are great for portrait work. This is a very affordable lens, if you take its versatility into account, that's pretty great bang for your buck.Cons: Autozoom seems to have trouble locking on under less than ideal lighting conditions, especially at the longer end of the zoom. The lens extends quite a bit (about double length, or almost) with zoom and focus, which can be impractical in some situations. Lens does not include a hood, so you might want to add that to the price. There's no FTM (Full Time Manual) which means you have to flip a switch to go into manual focus mode, instead of just moving the focus ring with your hand. As all EF-S models, it won't work on a full frame camera, so if you're planning to upgrade, this lens is probably not a good choice.Conclusion: if you want a versatile and affordable lens, and you're willing to live without the build and image quality of higher end lenses, this is a good choice, you will be able to get very nice shoots in portrait and tele-photo ranges. If you really want high end image/build quality, and you are willing to pay for it, you should go for the L Series 70-200, that's a great lens and the non-IS version is quite affordable. This is my go-to lens for carrying around when traveling, and I really appreciate the benefit of not having to switch lenses ever 5 minutes.""
"20120515","5.0","Nice lens for casual photographer","It was an upgrade for XTi with stock lens. It works great as promised and pictures are good and clear. It's light and some says the quality of material is cheap. In my experience, it's not too bad and solid product because I dropped it from about two feet high to hard floor but nothing was broken and works good as before.""
"20120514","5.0","Needed a zoom lens and this one fit my needs perfectly!","I am a fairly new photographer and I purchased this zoom lens to add to my Canon Rebel T2i kit lens. I had my new camera for about a month and was really realizing that I needed to get more zoom. It was very disappointing going to the wildlife safari and not having enough zoom to get a decent picture of the animals. I read all the reviews and decided to give this lens a shot. I am so glad I did! I don't have alot of money to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on new lenses, so this one was in the perfect price range.  I am able to get alot closer to whatever I am wanting to photograph with this lens. I always keep my 18mm-55mm lens with me though, due to the focal range on this zoom lens starts at 55, so if you keep it on as your walk around lens, sometimes you find yourself on top and too close to your subject. I would definitely recommend this lens.""
"20120513","5.0","Great lens","This has been nothing but a great lens from the start. Other reviewers said the focus can be slow or the IS doesn't work at 250mm but I've had none of those problems. The true test for me was taking pics of the moon at night with full zoom. What amazing shots? The photos almost look fake because there is so much detail. After about 1 month I am very pleased.Nutshell- Great lens for the money and I would highly recommend it!""
"20120510","5.0","Great lens!","Great lens! Great  all around lens. Have been using a few weeks and have no complaints.  Produces nice sharp pictures. Wonderful not to have to change lenses as much when using this lens. Very pleased with my purchase!""
"20120509","3.0","Good Lens; Could be Better","The lens has a great zoom range, and takes nice clean, sharp pictures thanks to the image stabilization.  However, the auto-focus doesn't work all that well if the lighting isn't perfect.  Given a nice sunny day, the auto-focus is very responsive and accurate.  If you're indoors, or shooting at dusk, be prepared to wait up to several seconds for the focus to be set; if it can acquire focus at all.  I find that if I am dealing with dim lit shots of a static subject, manual focus is much more effective.Upon the first use of this lens, I thought something was broken.  This is because the image stabilization makes a light grinding noise.  While the noise can be annoying while taking pictures, it can be catastrophic when recording a video.  Consider that the grinding noise is coming from a lens directly attached to the camera.  This grinding travels very well to the internal microphone, and is forever recorded with your video.As a side note: It would also be nice if Canon started putting their lens caps on leashes.  For those that don't like a dangling lens cap, they can remove it.  For those who like it, we wouldn't have to buy a new lens cap!""
"20120430","5.0","Ridiculous value proposition","I've shot with both the 70-200 F4 (Non-IS) and the 70-200 F2.8 IS II lenses, and this thing gives you 90% of the image quality at 10% of the price. That's ridiculous value. Canon has tele-zooms down to an art.Of course it's plastic. Of course it will hunt a bit in a dimly lit gym. But in a blind test (no pun intended), the average hobbyist (not the pixel-peepers who pore over the corners at 100% crops) would have a hard time distinguishing output from this lens as compared to the high end zoom lenses - it's that good.I think Canon has just come out with the II version of this lens - just buy it.""

"20111212","4.0","Outstanding lens for what it is","If you're looking at this lens, wondering if you should buy it, you're new to DSLR photography. Welcome! And the short answer is, yes you should.With this lens, you get a great focal range - if you're using it on a crop sensor camera (and again, if you're looking at this lens, you are) it'll effectively take you from an 88mm focal length all the way to a stunning 400mm. This is because most of Canon's cameras have a crop factor of 1.6, which means you multiply the lens' claimed focal length by 1.6 to get the comparable focal length on a full-frame camera. What that mumbo-jumbo means is, this camera will get you some great pictures of stuff that's pretty far away. When you have this lens and the 18-55mm lens that most likely came with your camera, you've got 99% of the focal range you'll ever need covered. It's great for capturing sports, wildlife, parades, speeches, or any other subject where you can't get close to the action.Higher-end lenses with comparable focal range cost three or four times as much, with less range. And that's without IS (image stabilization). Add that to the more expensive lenses and the cost doubles. Here, you get it almost for free. Image stabilization, also present on your kit lens, is a small motor connected to a gyroscope that cancels out the usually-imperceptible tiny shakes of your hands. These shakes are really noticeable when you're zoomed in, and can ruin an otherwise great shot. I would go so far as to say that beyond 200mm or so, image stabilization is an absolute must, even if you're shooting from a tripod - the lack of it is why I do not recommend the 75-300mm lens, even though it has a greater range and a lower price. Not only that, image stabilization can also let you take pictures with a slower shutter speed (even the sturdiest of hands can't go below 1/60th of a second), which is really helpful in low-light situations.Speaking of which, one potential downside to this lens is its aperture, especially at maximum zoom. While I don't have the space to go into the relationship between aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, a lower aperture is generally preferable. A lower aperture means the lens lets in more light, which leads to lower shutter speeds, brighter pictures, and a better end result. Again, generally speaking. This leads to a related point about lens sweet spots - that aperture setting where the lens is its absolute sharpest. It's not at the lowest setting, f5.6. In fact, on my copy, it's around f13 - which makes it great for daytime shooting, outdoors, in full sun or in the shade. When the clouds come out, or the sun goes down, or the action moves indoors...well, your pictures suffer. Either you'll adjust the aperture down, or the camera will if you're shooting on Auto, and overall sharpness takes a nosedive. This isn't a problem specific to this lens. EVERY lens will do this, though this lens' sweet spot is at a high enough aperture setting that it can be a problem. Your pictures will still look great, but they won't be as great as they could be. At f5.6, things can get pretty blurry.Build quality isn't great. The mount is plastic, not metal. Actually, most of the lens is plastic. The lens itself is incredibly light, but in a way that makes it feel less than solid. The rear lens cap doesn't stay on very well at all. QA isn't as strict on the lower-cost lenses, so you might find a copy with flaws. I don't mean to say that this is a poor investment. It's not. Just be aware that lower price comes at a cost. If you treat your camera gear well, the plastic construction shouldn't be a problem. Use the neckstrap on the camera, and keep lenses in a closed padded bag when not in use.The only other downside, while minor, is the autofocus motor. It's slow, and it's loud. It's not as loud as a barking dog or a tornado siren, but it does make noise while it's trying to focus, and the IS motor makes noise as well. This lens doesn't have Canon's USM motor, which is no surprise at this price point. If you're trying to get a shot of a fast-moving subject, you might miss it while waiting for this lens to autofocus.Overall, for its faults, this lens is an excellent value for someone just getting into DSLR photography. The price is just too good for what you get. Not only is it wonderful to learn and practice on, you really can get some fantastic shots with this lens. At the end of the day, there is almost no reason why this shouldn't be the first non-kit lens you ever buy.""
"20111212","5.0","Completely Satisfied","I got this lens to take along on long hikes and while snowshoeing, times I really don't want to have to carry a tripod. I enjoy taking pictures of the wildlife here in the Rockies and the 75-300 NON IS lens that came with the camera demands the use of a tripod and a remote shutter release. This lens solves that problem, and while I have only had a few weeks to play with it, I have found that it solved the problem of relying on nature for a usable tree stump or a slow exhale followed by a shutter release, neither of which was a very satisfactory solution to no tripod. While I am certain that this lens will preform even better with a tripod, I can get very good pictures just by leaning against a tree. I am very happy with this lens, and just wish I had not taken so long to make the purchase.""

"20111208","5.0","Great value for new photographers","I'm just a beginner when it comes to anything photography, and I think that's exactly who this lens is catered to: the beginners and occasional novices who need extra reach. One of the reasons I got my DSLR in the first place is because I was tired of lugging around both my Canon Rebel XS and my HD Sony camcorder and having to constantly choose between great picture and no video option vs. OK picture with great video. My Canon T2i covers the great picture and video aspect, but I was missing out on the zoom. Because of that, I picked this lens up and it makes a great compliment to my kit 18-55mm lens for the times that I need that extra distance. For the price ($199.99 at the time of this review) you can't go wrong if you are looking to expand your lens collection without breaking the bank.""

Perfect for the weekend shooter if you understand it's limitations. Auto focus is accurate most of the time. Low light shooting gets tough due to the f4 max aperture. I do mostly landscapes and mountain shots, some wildlife, and some motocross and it has been super solid. Combined with the 18-55 kit lens I have a pretty good all around setup. I'm not a pro by any means, but I've taken some great shots with fairly entry level DSLR gear. A good grasp of photography fundamentals will do more good then spending a ton of money on high end gear that you don't know how to use. I give this 5 stars for being a great lens for the money.""

It feels lot heavier and sturdier than the kit lens. Auto-focusing takes longer than the kit lens, and is little bit nosier too, especially in low light where it struggles a bit. Zoom ring is not very smooth. Pictures are very sharp and the image stabilization works great!

I was amazed at how close this telephoto lens got to the subject.  The day I got the lens I went to shoot a building in town for the webpage.  I put the EF-S 55-250mm lens on the camera and walked the three blocks to the building.  I could not get the building in the frame without crossing the street and introducing traffic and traffic lights into the picture.  I used  the kit lens (EF-S 18-55 mm) and got the shot.  I have used the lens at a Fly-In at the local airport.  I was able to zoom in as planes landed and you can see the pilot's faces as they were landing.  Also you could get great shots of the aircraft taking off and get several shots  after they were in the air.  The shots were always sharp no matter how far the subject was away from the camera.  I remember from the old AT-1 zoom, the further the object was away from the camera the more a tripod was needed.  Not with this lens.  The IS worked very nicely and every shot was sharp.  I would recommend this lens.""

My point and shoot still zooms farther but of course doesn't get as good of images or have IS. This is really good for getting images of animals that would otherwise run if you got close. I have no real complaints about this lens.One thing I will point out, it seems to be a slight issue with a UV filter on this lens when it is zoomed. You get some bad internal light reflections. This happens with a cheapo UV filter and a nice one I have. Only noticeable at night. I don't count off because the lens without a filter works great.

"20111004","5.0","Awesome Quality Lens","Having the OEM 28-55mm on the camera and now having the next step up 55-250 it makes photo life what it was meant to be--fun and inviting.. I can't wait to get out each and every day for my walk and take it with me. I find I use this lens more than the smaller one as it has so much more flexibility in the shots I am looking for. Good value for the dollar with this purchase.""
"20111003","4.0","Cheap and OK","The 55-250 IS is a good value - at $200, image quality is about what you would expect.  It's soft when shot at maximum aperture (Sharpness is OK at f/8-f/11), has relatively poor contrast (images are a bit dull) particularly when the lens is set to 250mm, focusing is slower and more difficult than on a lens with USM.  If you're looking to shoot sports, or birds in flight, I'm not saying that it's impossible with this lens, but I am saying that you will be making things hard on yourself.Want to take the camera to the zoo?  This is a good choice for that.  Kid's daytime baseball game? Sure.  Just don't kid yourself.  For anything you may want to do with this lens, you can get something significantly better for 2-3x the price.  I've even nabbed a few good pictures of birds in flight, but that was as much a matter of chance as anything else!This lens can produce great results, in the right circumstances, but it can also be a hinderance in many others.  Trying to focus on a bird in a tree with a distracting background is a difficult thing - and yes, the bird may fly away before you get it to focus on the bird.  In tough focusing situations where there are a lot of contrasty things to focus on, even my 7D has trouble picking what to focus - it jitters back and forth, and you often don't find out that your shot was totally out of focus until you see it on the computer.  My experience with my 70-200 F4L IS lens is quite a bit different than the 55-250 - the L lens snaps in to focus with ease.If you're looking for more reach or somewhat better focusing performance, the 70-300 IS lens is significantly better across the board.  The only downsides are price and size - the 70-300 is a bit larger and quite a bit more epxensive. The 70-300 IS, performs much better than the 55-250 at 250mm - everything extra is a bonus.If very fast focus, superb sharpness and contrast, and a larger aperture are what you need, just get the 70-200L already.  It's sharp enough that you're better off cropping images shot at 200mm than using the 55-250 at 250mm, and the difference in focus accuracy and performance are tremendous, even on a lowly Digital Rebel. You may give up IS with it, but, let's face it.  The 55-250 is a daytime lens too.The image stabilization works very well.  In the real world, I get about 3 stops of stabilization - I can shoot still subjects comfortably at shutter speeds in the 1/50 range - it just takes a few images to guarantee a sharp shot.In the end, the 55-250IS serves its purpose.  It's not going to amaze you with anything, frankly.  But it will pleasantly surprise you with how good it is... for the price!I can only seriously recommend this lens to someone who is highly budget constrained, or to someone that already has a large telephoto lens, and needs something tiny to use for casual snapshots. It's a starter lens - it may be adequate for you, but if there's something that you need above and beyond it, you will be able to tell pretty easily.  The other lenses I mentioned are thoroughly superior, but cost hundreds more.  At the $200 price point on Canon mount, however, there is no better option.""
"20110929","5.0","Great Lens!","I am a beginner photography hobbyist and had a hard time trying to choose what type of lens to get in addition to the kit lens that came with the camera. I am very happy I chose this one! I've taken some amazing pictures with this! The image stabilization is fantastic. I really needed that since I don't have a tripod, yet. Even at 250mm the camera holds steady and can take some amazingly detailed pictures. Some reviews I read said the build quality is sub-par. Yes, it does have a plastic mount, but it feels very solid so that isn't even an issue for me. This lens is perfect for any hobbyist. I definitely recommend this to anyone.""
"20110928","3.0","Great for the price, but not great","I read a lot of reviews before buying this lens. They all said that the lens is great for the price. This is true. But, it's not a great lens. After three weeks with the lens, I'm returning it and looking for something better. Sure, I'll have to spend a lot more, but I won't have to add the caveat 'for the price' when looking at my photos. If you're on a budget, I recommend this lens... it'll give you much better photos than a point-and-shoot. It's built better than the kit 18-55 lens. If you want edge-to-edge sharpness and contrast, look elsewhere.""
"20110927","5.0","Great product. UNBELIEVABLE price","Very good quality lens that is great for close and landscape type long shots. I wasn't able to find any lens with this wide a range. The images come out crisp and almost as good as my Nikon AF-S 105mm, though not quite there yet. But this lens is less than half the price so I can't complain. The image stabilization sems to be working well so far, not blurry aspects when clicking. The only one issue I have with this lens is that it is not great in dim light conditions. I find it extremely difficult to capture good shots even with a really slow shutter speed. But the frames overall come out okay. In bright lights, this lens is as good as any other expensive lens out there. And did I say that the price was phenomenal?""
"20110926","5.0","Excellent price!","It is priced very very reasonably and is very easy to use.

AF often misses, images frequently come out soft and IS is quite noisy. However it is light-weight and inexpensive. Just remember to make several shots to make sure you get the subject in focus.""
"20110918","4.0","Good lense for the price","I bought this to mate it to my T2i. It is a very good lens for the price. It is a bit slow in low light auto focus, but you would have to pay hundreds more for a nominal improvement. Most of the time if I am shooting something in low light I manually focus. The same is true for fast moving objects. I have had better luck using it manually. This is an entry level image stabilizer and in most situations it performs well. I have noticed long range shots can show some signs of destabilization, but the frame rate is fast enough that you can usually get a decent shot off. The construction of this lens is mostly plastic which is understandable at this price point so it may not hold up over the long term. It should hold up long enough for the average user and last long enough to justify the expenditure. You will probably want to upgrade to newer or better technology before this lens fails. The only real detractor for me with this lens is the fact that the auto focus is a bit loud to shoot wildlife. I have spooked away a few good shots because I forgot to switch to manual focus. I have never shot video with this lens but I have been told it will not auto-focus in this mode so it is very difficult to get good video.OverallProsGreat lens for the price at $150-$200 pictures are clear and natural looking with good detailGood IS performanceConsLoud auto focusonly fair auto focus performance (it can be slow)not designed for videoBottom line unless you are a pro this lens will suffice for most situations. I use mine primarily for wildlife and landscapes so the noise and auto focus has been a factor for me when shooting wildlife. I have still taken some fair shots and am happy with this lens for the price.""
"20110916","4.0","Great value for the quality and features","This zoom lens is very easy to workwith when taking a snapshot of a distant object.  The IS is a wonderful thing.

You are not going to be able to take fast action shots with auto focus on but for the hobbyist who has a little bit more time to set up a shot, this does the trick perfectly.This lens was well used in Alaska, especially useful when taking closer up shots of eagles and whales. Eagles remained high on their tree perches so photos easy to take.Whales on a moving boat was trickier but still managed to get a few good shots.Overall am very pleased with this lens. It suits my needs perfectly for the time being. Barring professionals (hence they have the 'L'-woooo series which costs many times more than this) this will suit the majority of people's need.""

"20110912","5.0","Just an amazing value in lens degign","I have to say that I am absolutely blown away that Canon was able to build this much quality at this price point.  I bought this lens as a small and light travel and camping telephoto with only moderate expectations.  I also own both the 70-200 2.8 IS and the 100-400L telephotos, so I have some quality standards to compare it to.  Yes, its not quite as fast optically or speed of focus wise, but it is shocking how comparable the images are from this small and light lens.  Did I mention that it weighs but a quarter of the weight of the 70-200 and actually fits just fine in my jacket side pocket.  I have more years with Canon lenses than I would care to admit, and have been a devotee of several of the L models for many years, but I have to admit that this lens has got to have 90% of the performance of its expensive cousins for a fraction of the price.  Between this, and the recent 15-85mm, Canon has really produced some bargains.  Unless I have a need to really shoot wide open at fast apertures, (which I occasionally do), I really have no problem with the compromise of this lens.""

According to Cannon, the newer version is improved as follows: 'The main differences between the newer and older versions of the lens are the weight (slightly lowered) and the design of the zoom ring (changed to conform to newer lens designs.)'I asked the Cannon people how customers are supposed to know if they are getting the old or new version - in other words if the description of the product, or a code, or the wording on the box was different.  The reply was:  'When an authorized dealer lists the product, they should list the correct product designation.' I'm not sure what that boils down to, but I didn't see a statement from Amazon.com in the product description stating if what they are selling on-line was/is the old lens or the updated version.I ordered the lens from Amazon, but returned it because it doesn't work well enough for my purposes.  The color doesn't seem true, the auto-focus has problems - so much so that manual focusing is more dependable.  It's not particularly good in low light, and not fast enough or sharp enough for my needs - and with visual limitations I can't tell the results of shots until they are on the computer screen.  Bottom line - I need a lens a can depend on, not one that sometimes results in a good shot.Note:  The lens is made in Malaysia, not Japan.Other:  Someone at Amazon keeps meddling with the wording of my comments, and taking pertinent information out, such as the same lens being available at Cannon for less.

From what I've read, most of what is being done in the next version is mostly cosmetic, so hopefully the things I'm reviewing will be similar in the new generation.The lens focuses faster than I thought it would (have read so much about the ultrasonic motor system for auto-focus vs. the one this one has) and usually focuses well.  Occasionally it will take a little longer than you would hope, especially if it is zoomed out to 250mm.

Get a lens hood and uv filter and you will be good to go.Why 4 stars? I am into technical details - It is not as sharp as a 'prime' (non-zoom) lens. It is not as sharp as a $1000 zoom lens.

Lense has a plastic base, a cheap feel and is noisier when compared to lenses costing hundreds more, but it takes good pictures. I have not taken any pics in with low lighting yet. All the photos I've taken are in day light or with a flash with good results. This lense replaced an older Canon 70-210 ultrasonic lense which weighed about twice as much.""
"20110812","5.0","Using is a breeze","This is my second lens for a new rebel ti. Just as the other amazon reviews stated, it's a great second lens to add to the stock 18-55. Image stabilization is key. I'm just an amateur, and using it is no problem""
"20110811","5.0","Can't beat it for the money","At $189, this is probably the best deal for a longer zoom lens out there, hence it's nickname of the nifty 250.  It's not too bulky or heavy, takes excellent pics, and is quick to focus.  The focus ring is quite responsive without being sloppy (give manual a try, you might like it) and the IS works like a champ.With the crop sensor in the rebel series, you're looking at the equivalent of 88-400.  That's a great range.  Minimum focus distance is about 3.5 feet if you're trying to get those great blurred background shots.  That's been my favorite thing with this lens so far.Pros:Excellent picture qualityFairly light and smallFast auto focusGood focus ringImage StabilizationCons:Plastic build (expected at this price)If you want a great, versatile setup go with this lens, the kit lens, and the 50 1.8.  They're all plastic builds but all take pretty good pics and should do you just fine until you really figure out what type of photography suits you.  Then go drop serious money.""
"20110807","4.0","Canon EF-S 55-250mm lens","This is a great lens for people on a budget. I am new to the DSLR world but I read reviews on this lens and for the money it is really nice. I like the quality of images it takes more than my kit 18-55mm lens. The only thing is I have to step back about 10-15 ft. for this lens to take wide enough shots of people. Its good for big areas and for when you can't get really close range to your subject matter. Also the Image Stabilization really helped out when zooming while I used my camera handheld. I recommend this lens to anyone on a budget looking for a good zoom lens.""
"20110807","5.0","Great Lens at a Great Price","After reading the reviews for this lens I decided to add it to my 'toolbox.'  If you are an amateur photographer looking for a great lens in the telephoto range at a great price.... look no further.  I appreciated some of the critical reviews, because it gave me some things to consider in purchasing and using this lens.  In the end, I decided that if I couldn't put the time and effort in to making a good value lens like this work for me, then I probably was not very committed to serious photography, and spending hundreds of dollars more on a more professional lens would be pointless.  Some day I may be able to justify an L-series lens, but for now I am happy taking some amazing photos with this lens.""
"20110806","4.0","Much better than the price reflects","As a former professional photographer I know how important it is for pros to own the best. That's why Canon can ask and get $1500+ for their bestselling L-series zoom. Those who need pro-quality lenses should expect to spend that amount and far more. Those non-pros who have the money and just want the best, should definitely buy Canon L-series--why not?  When I decided to sell my dated professional cameras (the 'D' was on the other side of the model number) I did a lot of soul searching and researching before I decide where to go next. My lenses were still top quality and fit the newer EF bodies, but lacked modern technological advances like IS. I no longer saw a reason to spend $1000+ on a camera body and $1500+ on a lens. I didn't need video capability. Most of what I take goes up on the Internet, so 10-12 megapixels provides all the cropping room I need. I wanted light weight, good picture quality, and a reasonable price. I found it in the lowly but capable Canon XS (read my review elsewhere). I have no problem with the 18-55 kit lens, but I frequently used my older 28-105 USM lens instead, because it focused faster and was slightly sharper.In anticipation of an upcoming hiking excursion on Kauai, I decided to pick up a new longer-zoom lens with image stabilization and I again set about doing my due diligence. What I found was that there just wasn't any good reason to go to Canon's middle ground when it comes to lenses. A wide array of testing and reviews showed that Canon's S-series 55-250 was not that far removed from anything short of an L lens -- except in price of course. I was almost embarrassed and feeling a little cheap when I ordered this lens. But now that I've had it for a couple weeks, there is no question in my mind that I made the right choice. I love the size and light weight. The stabilization works like a dream. I've always be a stable base for hand-holding a zoom lens, but I'm now shooting at 250mm 1/200 sec and getting tack sharp results. There is no question that his lens is worth far more than what I paid--thank you Amazon.What do I wish this lens had that it doesn't? I suppose a metal attachment flange would make me feel more secure.  A stop or two more speed, sure. But my only real complaint is the exterior focusing movement that I didn't have to deal with in my older EF USM lenses. The front of this lens moves around a lot, and even if you set your zoom and focus first, using a circular polarizer is a royal pain. For the same reason, I can't use a tulip hood, which is far and away preferable to the ET-60 'Dice Cup' Canon designed for the 55-200. (I did, however, just order one--what choice did I have?)Is the Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens perfection? Absolutely not. Does it perform far above this old ex-pro's expectations? You bet it does, and for a price that is, in my opinion, way below its worth.Addendum: I forgot to put in my two cents re: the noise mentioned by other reviewers. Noise levels may vary depending on the lens you get--I can't speak to what others are experiencing. However, my lens makes no more noise during focusing than any autofocus lens I've used or been around. The stabilization mechanism makes a mild, almost humorous crackling sound--kinda like paper being wadded up--but on my lens, there has to be dead silence around me in order to hear it. I never notice it under typical shooting conditions--and believe me, no one is more sensitive to noise than I am.""

"20120413","5.0","Love this lens","This is a fantastic lens considering its price, its zoom range, its compact size, and its light weight. It's by far the cheapest lens I own (the others are the $700+ Canon 15-85, the $400+ Canon 60 macro, the $400 Tamron 28-75).I considered getting the Canon 70-200mm f/4 IS L lens but for 5x the price you get less zoom range, a heavier and bulkier lens, and perhaps a little more snob appeal with the white barrel and that precious red ring.  No doubt the L lens surpasses this one when you photograph test charts (how often do you do that?), and its weather sealing allows it to withstand thunderstorms better, but frankly speaking, if you're not a pro who pushes the envelope, who cares?If you have a crop camera, this lens lets you take advantage of the smaller sensor - you're not paying for (and lugging around) all that extra glass.  Maybe the extra $800 you spend on the L lens will make a difference in 1% of your photos, but you realize the benefit of the lighter weight and smaller size 100% of the time.  Plus you're more likely to bring it with you.Yes, at longer focal lengths you lose one f-stop compared to the L lens.  But at those focal lengths, DOF is short anyway, so you can still get portraits with blurred backgrounds at f/5.6.Sure, the front element rotates and the autofocus is slower, and you can hear the IS at work, but are those worth $800?""
"20120410","4.0","Well Priced, but --","This lens is well priced, but suffers from being quite soft and has some minor design issues.First, I don't think anyone could really expect this to be tack sharp at this price level, but it's not terrible either. As always though, you get what you pay for. Second, if you buy the lens hood with it, you'll find that it's difficult to remove the lens cover with it on. It's a minor complaint, but you'll need to work around it.**Heads Up** I bought this lens for roughly $180. Currently they're charging a bit more than that, but someone else on Amazon is selling the newer IS II version for a lesser price. Search for that instead. ;)""
"20120409","4.0","Better for Macro than Telephoto, Good value for money","This lens makes a good macro lens. I have tried it for telephoto but the Image Quality is not very impressive. But Its an okay lens, definitely great value for money. If the choice is between no telephoto and cheap telephoto, I'd go with this lens.I always considered myself a landscape person, macro was never my thing. But ever since I tried this lens to shoot flowers from up close @250mm, I'm so swayed by the results that I am now totally into macro photography. For a starter like me 18-55mm and 55-250mm make a great walk-around combination. Yes you have to change the lens sometimes, but the results are decent enough and don't cost a fortune. And for those low aperture shots, there's the nifty-fifty.""

Picture quality!you will get less distortion and superior optical quality.With only 1 lens, you will get noticeably more distortion at the extreme ends because compromises are put into the manufacturing process to keep cost down, weight down and to extend the focal length.This lens is a keeper and I would recommend it to anyone as a first telephoto lens.""

I so far leave this lens on unless I need to get the real wide shots, and the 55mm seems to be right at the same focal point as my eye. Images have been clear, color good, and it's put a smile on my face several times already.

I tried the non-is version of this lens and returned it after a week. I eventually got the IS version which is this particular product. I have to say it met my needs 90% of the time. I thought it took amazing shots during the day, and early evening. I had to switch the camera to full auto mode to get a decent night shot. The true test was when I used it assateague island, MD where it's inhabited by wild horses. I got to use the lens to full capacity and felt it did the job enough.Pro's:A. Price is greatb.

It doesn't work that well in Tv mode.C. Slighty loud when focusing.D. It kind of becomes annoying if your trying to concentrate on your shot.Overall:I thought the camera was awesome for somebody of a novice level.

"20110705","4.0","Great lens!","This is my first telephoto zoom lens, and I have been having so much fun experimenting with the new abilities it gives me.  It does a wonderful job at doing what it was designed for: taking quality pictures at a distance.  So far, I have used it to take pictures of wildlife and pictures at a concert, and I've been quite happy with the results.  Previously, my concert photos always had to be cropped way down, and the image quality was therefore not great; but with this lens, I finally have some true-to-life pictures.  The same goes for pictures of wildlife (I've snapped shots of beaver, deer, muskrats, squirrels, chipmunks etc).  With my 58mm lens, I could take pictures, but it was difficult (if not impossible) to get close enough for a high quality image.  This lens gives me a much more crisp, clear image that I don't need to crop much.As someone who only takes pictures as a hobby and for memory-keeping, I like that the zoom mechanism is plastic and lightweight. I want to be able to carry my camera on walks and not feel too weighed down.The limitations of this lens are that you must be standing at several feet distance from the subject to focus: so if you want to catch a dragonfly on a flower, you have to back up a few feet and then zoom in for a close-up shot.  I learned this the hard way!  It is also slower to focus than the 58mm lens that came with my Canon Rebel T2i, especially in lower light.  However, for me, it was most important to be able to take quality shots at a distance at a relatively reasonable price and this lens performs very well.""

I find no drawback in the fact that the front element rotates as focus is made; my 18-55 IS does that also. For the money it is hard to say anything but this lens is a great value.

"20110621","5.0","One of my favorite lenses (for the price)","I am an amateur photographer that loves kids portraits.  This lense is ideal to take kids pictures! You can just be at the back taking candid shots.  I think it is very sharp considering the price and the IS is a good feature because it compensates the aperture limitation.  Just be aware that IS will still give you blur pictures because compensates for your camera shake but at slower speed, if your subject moves, then your picture will still be blurred.  Also, there are some instances where I have to switch manual when taking pictures with low contrast.  Turn off the IS when not needed and the autofocus would work much better and faster.  For action pictures like kids sports, if you have plenty light you may be better off without the IS as well.  When it comes to lenses you have to compare apples to apples.  It is not the fastes glass, the focusing may not be the fastest either,  the built cheap (but is very light in comparison with the focal distance it covers) but for the money I think is pretty good lense and great complement to the 18-55 you find in most rebel kits.

This lens is an excellent addition. I really wanted to find a cheap lens, though after paying a grand for a camera when I barely know how to use it, that may sound counter productive.Pro's:  Price, capabilities, plug and play.Con's:  Noise, build quality, weight.It doesn't seem that cheap, it appears to be identical to the stock 18/55mm lens, but the increased size gives it a less than solid feel - it's not flimsy, just doesn't feel super strong.  It is also considerably heavier than the 18/55 lens, just from the feel in hand I'd say it's 3x the weight.  It also seems to make a lot more noise when in AF than the smaller lens, I don't know if it's this particular unit or something else, but it's noticeable and borderline obnoxious.Despite this, it's an excellent lens for a beginner like me, and well worth the price when added on to the price of the camera.""

Before buying this lens I'd been using a Canon 75-300 USM non-IS lens (the first version) I'd borrowed. That lens was awful, colors were unsaturated, it had horrible chromatic aberration, and pictures were blurry anywhere over 85mm. The 55-250 is a bliss, from the instant I started using it I've been extremely happy with the quality of pictures. Very sharp throughout the focal length range, very little chromatic aberration in few situations, good color rendition and contrast, nice bokeh. Focusing is not the fastest, but it's fine if you don't have too high expectations. Mount is plastic, you don't want to be too rough with it, and that's ok with me, I treat my equiment with extreme care. IS is awesome it's incredibly helpful. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent telephoto at a low price, forget the cheap 75-300, this one is so much better and 50mm less won't really make a difference.""

Anything better you'd be paying 500+ for the next one up.Image quality is great and as I said up above for the price you can't beat it.The IS never seems to fail no matter how much I tried. I was shooting for almost 3-4 hrs and didn't see a drop in battery life. The IS only works when the shutter release button is half pressed so as long as you keep that in check you'll be fine.Don't be fooled by the plastic/rubber body. It's pretty durable. The zoom feature is a tad stiff at first but will ease in time.-Cons-The weight of the lens is fairly heavy. I'm using a Canon EOS Rebel XT which is a fairly light model but the lens makes its a tad front heavy. Tripod would be recommended depending on what you're shooting. Now this will vary on your camera.The focus is somewhat slow so that can limit what kind of subject's you'll shoot. Also it's not the quietest lens out there. The IS is barely noticeable but when focusing its loud for a lens. Again this might change what subject you'll be shooting.Overall a great lens for those who want to excel their skills. I'm very happy with this lens and look forward to capturing amazing images with it.""
"20110418","5.0","Great quality with affordable price","I have a kit lens 18mm-55mm, and this lens is a complementary to it.. I really love the capability to zoom, and the quality result..so sharp.Plus, it came with the affordable price!!!""
"20110409","5.0","This Thing Is A Tank!!!","Ok, this isn't really a review; it's just me sharing my story. (I'll keep it as brief as I can)My family and I are running in the rain to catch a cab, this lens was in my jacket pocket. I jump in the back seat and slam the door shut, but it bounced back open. My coat had gotten stuck between the door, and the lens was smashed between the door and the car. In the cab I pull it out to see if it is ok, and glass is everywhere. I wait to open the cap off until we are outside. I open it up and look at it: Yep, glass smashed in. Looking at it closer, the smashed part was just the filter! I throw the glass away from the filter, and unscrew it; only to find the lens in 100% condition! Not even a scratch on it.THAT is build quality.Now I just need to shop for a filter.....""
"20110409","4.0","Great first telephoto","This is my first telephoto lens, and comparing it to my 18-55 f3.5-5.6 lens, its much stronger. It has a great range for shots, and does some very nice bokeh. Having a minimum aperture of 4 makes it impossible to take a picture of anything within a meter of you, but its a telephoto, not a macro. It is my main lens I use for sports, travel, and general use. I would recommend it if you dont have a telephoto already.""
"20110407","5.0","Easy to use and makes you looks good doing it.","I love this lens. I got it about 3 months after getting my T1i with standard kit lens and I do not regret it. The kit lens is great for party shots and snapping on the go, but this lens is great for adding that professional look to your pictures. I am not a pro nor to I claim to be, but this lens is great. The only draw back I have seen is that I have to keep a pretty good distance between me and my targets if they are a group of people. Not hard to do, but sometimes it can be a challenge to find a good place to retreat to so that you can get everyone in the picture.""
"20110407","2.0","OK lens","Shipping was very fast.  The lens quality is great for the level of lens.  This lens does not perform well in lower light, like cloudy days at the soccer field.  I was hopeful not to have to spend $900 on a lens, but I probably should have saved my money and gotten the more expensive lens.  SO far, we have taken very very good photos on normal sunny days, but not on cloudy overcast days.  We're still learning to use the camera, so maybe some of this is experience, but I think more of it is the lens.""
"20110405","5.0","Great Lens","I was looking for a lens to compliment my standard lens on the Cannon Rebel.  After reading a lot of reviews I decided to use this lens as the Standard lens 18mm - 55mm did not have the zoom range I was looking for, the Standard lens is great for close up shots.The new lens is a 55mm - 250mm and has a great zoom on it, I am now able to capture pictures from afar without scaring wildlife and so on, as a budding amateur I was concerned about what sort of lens I would need, I did not want to purchase a lens that would be no good for me.Some have mentioned because of the size of the lens it takes more time to focus, yes it does but this is to be expected as the drive now has more of a range to cover then your standard lens, but don't let this shy you away from it, does just what I need it to do and I am happy.Build quality is good, nice sturdy feel to it and the quality you would expect from Cannon, Manual Focus and Images Stabilizer switches on the lens just like the Smaller lens.Can't wait to use this lens more and get some great pictures from it.""
"20110323","5.0","55-250mm lens","I like this lens. It is a little noisy if you are not use to the sound of a telephoto lens. Otherwise it works great.""
"20110322","5.0","Great addition to your kit lens","I have had this lens for almost a year now, and I have to say it spends the most time on my camera.  It is an excellent addition to the 18-55mm kit lens on my XSi.  I find this lens very versatile and I do take most of my pictures with it.  As other reviewers have said, if you like the kit lens you will like this one too.  The IS is noticeably noisy, you can definately hear a buzzing noise but then again the camera is up beside your ear while you're shooting.  It has gotten that I don't notice it unless I think about it.  Image quality is great for what you pay for this lens.  I'm not a professional and no one sits down to scrutinize my photos so the quality is more than adequate for my needs.  The Autofocus is a tad on the slow side if you are going quickly from something near to far, but small distance changes are no problem.  I did pick up a Zeikos UV filter and ET-60 hood for cheap for extra accidental bump and glare/flare protection.  I have taken this lens to Greece and the Dominican Republic in the last year and I am very pleased with the photos I was able to take in the bright glaring sun, no flares with the hood and filter on.  Currently I have a Sony close-up filter on order and I will be trying out some 'almost-macro' shots this spring.  With this lens I can go from wider angle landscape/portrait shots (just stand back farther) to tight and close head shots, wildlife, close-ups and macros.  The only issue I have found are the filter threads on the end of the lens.  It is very difficult to thread filters straight without cross threading onto this lens, an issue I don't have with my 18-55mm.  Overall I am very happy with this lens and I highly recommend it to any amateur photographer.""

I thought something was wrong with it but after researching I realized it's normal. The zoom is nice and thats about all.  I would recommend going to your local camera store and testing it out before you purchase it.""
"20110216","5.0","Pretty Good Lens!","I'm no professional, but I have been able to get some great pics with this lens with a still subject. At first I was very disappointed because I wasn't able to get very good action shots.  I know some have said that it will take great action shots, but I haven't been able to accomplish that yet as I can't get focus and zoom fast enough to catch the shot.  Maybe that comes with practice.  Overall, I think that it is a pretty good lens, just will take some time to learn its limitations and adjust my own technique.""

After waiting almost two weeks,  received the lens. To me it was light, but the focus/zoom felt right. Problem was: it didn't fit my 5D because it was an APS-C lens! Duh!. It fit my EOS Rebel T1i, which, since I already had a lens of 28-135 on it, this lens didn't help me. I took a couple of exposures on the Rebel to look at the quality in Photoshop. (Pretty good, I thought.) I reboxed the lens in reverse order and sent it back on 3-day UPS ($28).When they received it, I got dinged a 10% re-stocking fee (another $30). I ended up ordering a Tamaron 70-300 through Amazon and got it in a few days. It is a bit heavier, but better glass. It was also $100 cheaper that Ace Photo's cost!!""

"20110209","5.0","Better than Sigma 18-250","I purchased a Sigma 18-250 zoom lens to replace my Canon kit lens (18-55)and this Canon 55-250 IS. After months of owning all 3 lenses I just now decided to do some testing/comparisons between the Sigma and the 2 Canons (cold winter boredom I suppose).The Sigma looks and feels like a great lens, but as far as image quaility (i.e. sharpness), not so great in my tests.I took identical photos with these lenses comparing variuous aperatures, focal lenghts, IS on/off, flash on/off, etc. (I was the same distance from subject, used the same subjects, used a tripod, etc.)This Canon 55-250 IS is diffinately sharper than the Sigma, especially at the 250mm end where it counts the most to me. The Canon, though inexpensive and seemingly not built that great, took sharper pictures, hands down. The Canon peaked at around f8 for sharpness at 250mm (and it was pretty sharp), while the Sigma was around f10-11, and still not near sharp.I didn't compare all of the image quality parameters, and perhaps the Sigma might fare better in others respects, but for me if I can't obtain relatively sharp pictures, the lens is, at best, only good for very general photography where sharpness doesn't matter.Not only this, but at 250mm the Canon photos are obviously zoomed in further than the Sigma. There appears to be some where around 30mm differance. Either Canon has under rated their lens or Sigma has over rated theirs, or something. In any case the Canon gives you considerably more zoom than the Sigma. If you should happen to own both lenses as I do, try this for yourself to see if I'm just imagining this.Also the Sigma did not seem to do any better than the Canon 18-55 IS kit lens, or maybe not even as good. But there wasn't a great difference on this end of the spectrum. The Sigma does OK here on this end. I might add, though, that the kit lense at 18mm was slightly wider than the Sigma at 18mm.So now I don't know what to do. I guess I'm sort of stuck. If I don't care what my pictures look like the Sigma is an OK one-size-fits-all lens for vacations and long hikes. But why not just use my really nice point & shoot that takes better pictures and has an even longer focal range? Or I can just go back to changing my el-cheapo Canon lenses again.Bottom line, the Cannon 55-250 IS lens is 5 star for what it is and what it does. Its not an L lens by any means, but for 250 bucks, give or take, its a pretty respectable lens. I've taken some pretty awesome pictures of birds-in-flight with this lens at 250mm! I might add here that pictures from this lens usually require a little post-prossessing, at least that has been my experience. This, however, usually involves quick, farely minor enhancements.""
"20110130","4.0","Decent Lens for the price","This lens came in a kit with my Rebel XSi. Well, not really a kit, but it was a bundled deal.At first I really liked using this lens a bit more than my wide angle lens, but it was very limited in many situations. You generally don't want to use it indoors for many things to say the least!It's also not very fast. It has trouble focusing in on things and taking pictures in low light.For the price I think the lens quality is pretty good, but it's certainly not going to be as good as some of the stuff you'll pay 3-10 times more for...I'd recommend it if you can get it on sale and you're not looking for top quality glass.""

"20110124","5.0","Quality on a budget","I shoot family & fun, not professionally. I look for quality on a budget.  I was looking for a telephoto with image stabilization that wouldn't break my bank.  I have an old full frame 70-300mm w/o IS & it has limitations. With the crop factor on the 55-250mm lens, I am actually not losing much at full zoom. This lens has inexpensive build quality (same plastic & light weight construction as 18-55mm kit lens). I may regret this some day, but not now. To compare, I also looked at the 70-300mm with IS.  It was more than twice the cost as the 55-250 mm that I purchased.I have been pleased to very impressed with the shots that I have taken with this lens. The autofocus range is quite far, so the focus time may be longer than expected.  Also, it does not always focus on exactly what I expect, but that has been the case with every telephoto I have used. I would put the focus time on par with other similar quality lenses. The color is vibrant and the images are crisp. Finally, I like that the threaded accessory mount is 58mm, the same as the kit lens. All of my screw on filters can be used with this lens.I would highly recommend this lens to any non-professional that is on a budget and looking for quality results.At the time of purchase (Dec 23rd), Amazon had this lens at $207, free shipping, free next day shipping, and they threw in a $12 haze filter for free. I ordered at 1:30 p.m. and the lens was at my door 26 hours later... Xmas eve. Spectacular job Amazon!""

"20101221","3.0","Good entry level to IS telephoto zoom lenses","I received this lens as a gift.  Of course that means nothing since I specified it.  Here are some of the issues I've discovered:1.  I understand other reviewer's concern with the plastic filter threads, and I have placed a Tiffen 58mm METAL UV filter on the lens for protection.2.  I have experimented with the lens in some very demanding light situations and it failed terribly.  - At full extension in poor light, in a moving vehicle, the images were worthless.  - At full extension in poor light, in a standing vehicle, the images were little improved.  - A large part of this problem was not the IS, but the difficulty of focusing in poor light.3.  I have taken a few pictures of stationary subjects from a stationary vantage point, with adequate light and the IS works very well.  Of course the depth of field improves dramatically with the decrease in aperture of well-lit subjects.4.  I have not added a polarizer yet, nor a lens hood, so I can't predict whether these accessories will cause any vignetting.  I'd be curious to hear of other's experience in this area.5.  I was concerned with some of the comments on the 'mechanical' speed of the lens, but did not find that to be an issue.I'm sure I'll have additional comments as I have more experience with this lens.  My overall impression right now is that it is an adequate accessory.  Don't expect to be able to do well in near impossible scenarios.  For most scenarios with good light, and slow moving subjects, it will be fine.  The 'cheap' construction may be an issue long-term, but I cannot begin to speculate on that now.  This is not a professional product, so manage your expectations accordingly.""

I thought I was ripping Canon off with this amazingly low priced lens with IS. It's not the miracle I wished it to be but is definitely what it promised and that is a lens that is fairly adequate. It's sharp but not that sharp; the contrast could be better but then for 200something dollars it's not bad at all! the more I played with it the better it proved to be. Didn't like taking portraits with it but other random pictures were good. And interestingly i didn't have to tweak the sharpness or contrast! the reason i gave it 4 stars is because it is fairly good for the low price it is for! I have a 100-300mm as well without any IS and tho that lens is way better in picture quality in terms of sharpness or contrast or built, my reason was the IS and well the image stabalization is not bad at all.

The zoom has been invaluable but the f-stop is insanely high. Don't bother trying to use this camera in low-light situations unless you are very patient and can spare the disk space for the hundreds to pics you'll need to snap to find one good one. The IS is a neat concept, but I don't see a difference between it and the stock lens in terms of blurred photos: again, probably a factor of the high f-stop. Then again this is a really cheap lens that can serve more than one function, I suppose. Average at everything. I give it 3 yawns out of 5.""

"20101126","4.0","Good enough for me","I got this with my Xsi and feel it's a lens that is under-rated.  I am just a hobbyist, but have used this lens for my kids baseball and other uses and have always been happy with the results.  I love the image stabilization.  I took shots from a moving boat, of my son while waterskiing AND blew it up to 20x30 and was more than satisfied with the sharpness.  Colors are not as bright as some of my other lenses, but for the money, it's a great option.""
"20101124","5.0","great size, ease and value.","Lens is great for the price. Focus is quick and all but quiet since this lens does not have USM. Pictures are crisp and true but I have not tested many adverse picture taking situations yet.""
"20101123","5.0","Excellent Lens","This is an excellent lens, no doubt. I have a Canon 18-55mm lens that came with the camera (Canon T1i). I am a beginner, but, I think would have been better if I had bought the camera (body only) and Canon EF-S 18-200mm lens, because it would be easier to carry only one lens, which I think is best for a trip.""
"20101120","4.0","Review: Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS Lens","I purchased the Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS telephoto zoom lens from Amazon last Saturday for a mere $208 with a free Tiffen UV Filter. I was not expecting much as far as superior optics or build quality, but like many, I was attracted to the small price tag, and abundance of features including Image Stabilization. Considering I have had the lens for a week, I have had enough time with it to give you an honest opinion review.First of all, I would like to talk about the lens build quality. The lens is apart of the EF-S family, meaning the lens will not work on full-frame bodies, such as the 5D and 1D series. On my Rebel XTi, you will get a true 55mm short focal length and a true 250mm long focal length, with the crop factor working in your favor. I will put up a post later on explaining the crop factor. Anyways, the lens in completely plastic. The zoom barrel is a cheap feeling plastic, as is the lens mount. Considering this, I would have assumed the lens will suffer from a cheap feel. Not exactly. This Canon lens feels great. It's light enough to balance well on smaller bodies, but heavy enough to stable evenly in your hands. The lens features a 58mm filter thread, so it's pretty standard will most of Canon's inexpensive lenses. In my case, this worked out great because I could still use my filters from my other three lenses. As mentioned, the camera mount is plastic, which is a bit of a turn off, but if you take care of your lenses when storing them or putting them on your bodies, the plastic will hold up well.Next, I would like to talk about the picture quality. On this lens, I noticed that many of the images lacked color. In short, many of them seemed washed out. It could just be the UV filter, but besides that, the quality is superb. The focus is spot on (most of the time), but when the AF is taking to long to hunt for a focus, which it does quite a bit, you can use the MF ring to your advantage. Sadly, there is no manual focus over ride, so you have to switch the lens into MF to focus manually. The IS works very well from my few tests. At longer focal lengths, the feature helps tremendously. On my 70-300mm USM, I noticed many of my photos were a bit blurry, but I can see that issue occur less often with this nifty feature. I will say just one thing, with IS on, the lens takes a very long time to hunt for a focus, and stabilized point, especially in low light environments.All in all, this lens is a pretty good deal. It has been on my lens 'wish list' since it came out. I'm glad I picked it up at such a low price.""
"20101119","4.0","canon Lens","I do like this lens quite a bit-- As an Intermediate amateur photographer I wanted a lens that was compact, easy to use and economical,but still offered features that I would get in a high end lens. This one fits the bill! Not the 'best' of the Canons but certainly the best for me and anyone who wants to spend less than $500. on an all around name brand lens!""
"20101119","5.0","So far so good!","Love the telephoto lens!  Only two bad things which occur with all telephoto lenses, compression of space so you lose depth of field and lens vignetting when you're over halfway zoomed in to your subject.  Other than that, it's perfect for what I use it for.""
"20101118","5.0","great lens for the price point","The only 'additional' lense made by Canon within an everyday Joe's budget.  Would that others they offer were as reasonably priced against the features offered.""
"20120316","5.0","Canon EF-S 55-250 mm Lens","My photography has traditionally been 'old school'.  I built a dark room when I was in High School so I could use an SLR and be as creative as my old Canon SLR would let me.  Now that I've stepped up to the Digital age I have to admit this lens is one of the best investments I've made.  It is on my Canon XSi 80% of the time and offers great quality, good range of close up and zoom for distance.  I also have taken many action shots of water skiers and other sports at full zoom where the image stabilization works its magic.  It is truly wonderful and provides spectacular clear images.""
"20120315","4.0","Good lens...","Basic lens. I have the Canon Rebel T3i 60D and bought this as an addition to the 55mm lense that I got with the bundle. After doing some research on bundles, I would recommend buying this lens in the bundle deals. Otherwise this lens is what I expected.My level of experience in photography: Student""
"20120314","4.0","Great.","We're amateur/recreational photographers.  We bought the Canon Rebel to upgrade from the standard point and shoot.  This is a good 'next step up' type lens when you want more zoom capability.  I researched several models and opted for the image stabilized model here.  No complaints thus far.""
"20120311","5.0","Great for beginners and newcomers to DSLRs","I'm a beginning photographer and I have had this lens along with my Rebel T3i for nearly a year now. For a beginner, this lens has been an excellent complement to the kit lens and has given a lot of versatility when I started out the DSLR photography. If you are newly entering the world of DSLRs from the world of point-and-shoot cameras, you will notice that your standard DSLR kit is probably lacking something that your old point and shoot had: zoom! This lens along with the kit lens will give a very wide focal range without totally destroying your budget for your new-found hobby.Having added different lens to my bag now, the 55-250 now seems a bit cheap quality-wise but when I first bought, all that I really cared for as a beginner was the telephoto capabilities. It does perform fairly well for being a budget lens and while I have considered upgrading it, I can't justify jumping into the next price range (which is a huge jump).Performance-wise, it does great. I've taken pictures of wildlife, portraits and tripod night shots and this lens performs well. However, knowing what I know now, I would say that the contrast on this lens can be a bit soft (nothing that a little photoshop tweaking won't fix).The image stabilization works very well and it doesn't have a noticeable drain on the battery. One this with the IS though is that it has to be turned off for tripod shots, otherwise it will make tripod photography very blurry. Autofocus is very fast and decisive with this lens.Construction-wise, the lens is still holding up. It has the same quality as the kit lens so it is OK. Nothing fancy with this lens. It is pretty light which is great for travel.Overall, it's a great lens for beginners and probably the best and perhaps only telephoto lens that you can get at this price range.""
"20120309","5.0","Great for starter collection","I have added this to my collection for the 55 to 250 range.  It is good for going to the zoo with the kids and short to medium range wildlife shots.  Birds need to be within 40 feet to get a full frame shot so it is not the best lens for bird shooting.  The price is great and I recomend making it the second lens to any novice kit.""
"20120307","5.0","Awesome Lens","This is a great lens, been using it for a few weeks now and I cannot be more satisfied, this makes a great addition to your standard kit lens.

"20120223","5.0","Great Lens, Good Performance.","I've had this lens for about a year now. I purchased this lens prior to a trip to Alaska and I was impressed. A Telephoto that is able to perform well in natural light and artificial light.So here is the Pros and Cons:Pros:-Very Sharp at around f/6 and above.-IQ very good for a lens that is under $300-Canon's Image Stabilization gives the user a chance to use the lens with out tripod, even in low light.Cons:-Color isn't as great when zoomed in at around 200mm-250mm-Very slow focus, especially in low light.Conclusion:I recommend this lens more for the beginners.For people who have an intermediate amount of knowledge of photography, I'd recommend that you save your money for the Canon 70-200mm f/4L.In short:If you feel like you need more reach in photos, and you are pretty short on money, definitely purchase this lens.""
"20101117","5.0","A Good Addition","As a pro and creative photographer I step away from pro lenses which give great results, but for creativity they can be limited. I got this lens to add to a Canon T2i I use for casual and creative work. The lenses is worth the price. Good quality construction, auto-focus work well. I suggest getting a UV filter for the front to add as a protection barrier for the lens, I keep a filter on ALL my lenses for this purpose. This lens does have hard plastic mount and plastic threads up front. The plastic filter threads can be a problem if you don't take the time to carefully put the filters on, but if you use a UV filter all the time on it you won't have a problem anyway. The plastic mount in the back works and fits just fine. I have seen some reviews of people complaining about the mount being plastic. If you think you have to have a metal mount then you are abusing your equipment. I have had lenses and cameras get trashed doing wildlife photography(usually do to animal interaction), a metal mount would not have saved the equipment. This lens isn't going to give you pro level optics, but it isn't suppose to since it isn't a pro lens. If you need pro level optics then buy pro lenses.Overall this lens is well worth the money for most photographers. Any problems you do run into can easily be fix post production.""
"20101116","5.0","I made the right decision!","I was faced with the dilemma of purchasing Canon's 75-300mm lens or this 55-250mm lens.  I am so glad I purchased this one!  The only factor that pulled me to the 75-300 was price.  However, the 55-250 although a bit more in price was the correct decision for me. I have been using the camera without a tripod and the image stabilization has been a huge help making my images clear. With the zoom capability, I am able to take some awesome close up shots. I love it.""
"20101115","5.0","Really fun accessory lense","I am an average photographer and certainly  not a pro, but not a beginner either. This is my first lens that I bought that didnt come with a camera already. I especailly love using this for wild life where you can zoom in out a mule deer, or birds, or really cool pictures of things like insects also.""
"20101113","4.0","Does a fine job in bright light","I purchased this lens to replace my Canon USM 28-200mm lens which for some reason has been taking slightly soft photos lately--just enough not to look sharp and clean. I use a Canon Xti digital SLR. I enjoy taking (thousands) of pictures of my son's soccer team and posting them to the school's web site. This lens produces sharp, vibrant photos in full, bright sun. I've gotten some really fun action shots. It is very light weight and easy to use, but I still use a mono pod for additional stability. I have not noticed a reduction in battery life due to using the image stabilization...I used it in sports mode (a lot of auto focusing while following action) and taken over 300 photos at a game with plenty of battery life to go. Unfortunately, it does have trouble with low light. Picture quality is markedly reduced on cloudy days. I do miss having the 28-55mm range included, but that's not a huge complaint. The extra 50mm at the long end is worth it. I have not yet used the lens anywhere other than the soccer fields. Overall though, I'm very pleased with it, especially at it's reasonable price.""
"20101110","3.0","So So: Depends what you need it for!","Okay so I am conflicted on this!I bought this a few years ago now because I was doing a small business and only had the one from the kit and limited resources.  I knew that a good lens was important but just did not want to spend alot, because I wanted to spread my resources out to get what I needed. THE LENS IS MOST IMPORTANT! I really should have got the best lens for what I needed and waited on the other stuff!I do alot of weddings! So I now have a few years of weddings under my belt. With a portfolio with pics that aren't up to par quality wise (not posed and a nice eye wise).So in my case I really should have gone with the best upfront! My work speaks for itself and is good so most people don't notice but people that are more experienced and myself notice! So I am lucky that it can be overlooked due to my talent. Even so a faulty tool in any craft is not going to deliver the best work. So for what I do which is primairily weddings this is the lens I should have gotten....http://www.amazon.com/Canon-24-105mm-USM-Lens-Cameras/dp/B000AZ57M6orhttp://www.amazon.com/Canon-24-70mm-2-8L-Standard-Cameras/dp/B00009R6WTWhich I am going to be getting! And am very confident in! So if your trying to get into the field professionally. Don't compromise your equipment with cheapie generic stuff just to get it all. Better to get the best for what your doing starting at the top of the list! The lens should be at the top of your list! That way you show how great your talent is! The lens I highlighted are the best of the best! Depending on your field depends on what you need! But I would research the L series! They cost more but that decorative red ring at the end means its the best of the best. So for image quality of your portraits I recommend searching the L series and although in all other aspects of life I do not believe in image in this case I believe that its important to sell a good professional image. The best of the best have this series! I have to say its kind of embarrassing taking someones pic at a wedding and some great aunt thats old and has crazy money to blow has a better lens then me! Not so good for the professional image to be the hired and have weaker equipment then the guests. So if your in my place trying to get a business going start with the best! ITS an INVESTMENT!However if you are buying this for hobby it is a very good lens for that purpose! Really it is great for the price for hobby and personal use! Just not professional!""
"20101110","4.0","Very decent lens for price","I purchased this lens primarily for the price.  I was looking for a telephoto zoom lens that would give me decent image quality, be an all-around telephoto, and be affordable enough that I would not mind taking it on treks or travel.Overall, this lens surprised me.  Even some of the technical reviews on the photo sites rate the image quality for this lens as 'impressively sharp' for such an entry level lens.  It has a very useful range (but do remember that with Canon crop-sensor cameras you have  1.6x factor, thus the 55-250mm range is really comparable to a 88-400mm range).The image stabilization works well, and it does help get sharp images.My 2 negative comments are:1. construction:  it is not very sturdy, mostly plastic (although strong plastic)2. the barrel rotates when focusing so it is a pain when you are using a polarizer filter -- you will have to adjust every time you focusIf you can afford it, get an L lens which will give you better construction quality, better image quality, weather-sealing, and no issues with polarizers.  If you can't afford the L lens, or if you want a cheaper lens that you won't feel terrible if something happens, this is a very good choice overall.Reviews:[...][...]""
"20101108","5.0","Love it!","I love, love, love this lens. I use this with my Canon Rebel T2i, I'm only a hobbyist, I don't take pictures professionally. The picture quality is great & even in low light. Sometimes it takes a couple of seconds for the image stabilizer to kick in though and that's frustrating sometimes, but it doesn't bother me to the point of regretting I bought it.""
"20101107","5.0","focus on the lens","For the price( $200.00-$250.00 ) you can not beat this lens. The stabilizer works great, its not as heavy as other lens i have used. The focus times can be a little trying at time when in the auto mode, but that's not out of the ordinary. The only other thing is the fact that since this is a ef-s lens so it does a 1.6x crop of a full frame sensor area.So if you look at something from lets say around 100 yards away with the naked eye, and then look thur your view finder at 255mm full zoom, you will notice that you are not seeing every thing that you did with your eyes.But all in all unless you want to spend a small fortune on canons high end lens this will work for all of the novices out there,that want to get close to things and have a image stabilizer.""

I believe if I had gone to the next higher series (much more expensive) I would have noticed a different, but I don't see MUCH between the two for zoom range.  I use both frequently though because the zoom ranges are still slightly different. If trying to choose a zoom I would suggest getting the cheaper Quantaray or Sigma.  If you really want to go Canon get the next higher series lens.""

"20100831","5.0","Great Value for a f4.0-5.6 lenss","I bought this lens at same time as the Canon T2i to pick up where the 18-55 kit lens leaves off, and have taken some very good photos with it.However, I learned taking photos at the Patriots vs Rams pre-season game that I will never get 'pro' quality photos at night, not even at professional football games where the lighting is very good to ensure tv viewers get good visibility.  Even with ISO at 1600 I was able to manage a shutter speed of only 400 at f5.6, not enough to get crisp shots of moving players.  Shots taken when there was a slow down or pause in the action were very good, even at the above mentioned settings, but when the players were moving rapidly, the shots were a little soft.  Post processing made them very satisfactory for personal enjoyment, but not for more more ambitious use.Earlier I might have given the lens a 4, maybe even a 3, because of my game experience, but since the game I have learned a lot about lenses and I now know that the relatively low-light photos I got were the best I could expect from this f4.0-5.6 lens.  If I were going to shoot a lot of night sports, I would be saving for a 2.8 zoom lens, but they are very, very expensive for a good one.  An f2.8 lens is a much faster lens than a 4-5.6In day time settings, I have consistently gotten clear, sharp shots but have not yet tried shooting kiteboarders, something I enjoy doing.  However, my expectation is that I will get good shots because I'll be shooting during the  day and able to shoot at 800 at a minimum, more likely 1000.I have been practicing taking sports photos by photographing the batters in action for several local teams.  Two of these games were in the late afternoon and I was shooting at 5 pm or later in October, meaning that light was becoming low.  For these shots I put the camera in Tv mode and set the shutter speed at 1000.  ISO was on auto and the camera was allowed to select the best ISO up to a maximum of 1600.  At this time of day, even in the autumn light, I got very crisp shots.  Many required some processing to improve exposure, but the results were very satisfactory because the subjects were sharp.  People to whom I have shown the photos said they were 'great'.In summary, for what I do most of the time, this lens is excellent.  And I really appreciate the image stabilizer.  I can't imagine buying a lens without it since 98% of the shooting I do is hand held.""

The lens is just a bit lighter than the old one and though other reviewers complain about the plastic mount, I have not had any issues.

"20100804","5.0","Choose the Canon","If you are reading review after review, trying to decide between this lens or the Tamron 70-300mm, I say, stop reading and order the Canon. I read hundreds of lens reviews (because I'm just crazy that way) and here's what happened.I was looking for a zoom just for hobby purposes. The Tamron costs a little less and has great reviews so I ordered it. I'd used a Sigma 300mm lens in the past with pretty good results, so I had no problem purchasing a third party lens. But, within one week, I returned the Tamron. Almost every shot I took was out of focus. I am a candid photograph taking kind of girl, so using a tripod is not an option. Plus, I never had to use a tripod with my Sigma 300mm so I knew getting a half way decent hand held shot was possible.In comes the Canon 55-250mm IS.  They say it's the IS that makes the difference, I don't really know. I just know I get good, clear shots most every time. Walking around my yard snaping birds and lizards. At the beach in the bright, bright sunlight. It's all good. I was afraid that losing that 50mm would be a big deal but it's not.I have not tried this lens in low light. I would not expect to get great results because of the speed and have a much faster lens for that purpose. No, it's not the heavy dutiest thing I've ever felt but it is sufficient for it's purpose. The picture quality isn't perfect, but they are certainly good enough for non-professional use. Very good, in fact. And I doubt seriously that anyone would expect perfection from a $200 lens.I gave it 5 stars because I believe it is a really, really good lens for the money.

"20100726","2.0","unlucky user experience","I bought this lense because I've already got the 18-55mm lense when I bought my CANON 450D. When I just got this new lens, I was very excited, but after I put it on, and did some test shots, I was confused. whenever I pressed down the shutter, from the view finder, I first saw a little shake of the lens, then heard the click sound. Then, I tried it a couple of more times, the same thing happened. Then, I took it off and re-installed it again. I thought maybe something didn't hook up correctly. Unfortunately, still had that little shake when I pressed the shutter. At last, I had to return it to seller. Maybe I'm the only unlucky person? But now, I'm looking for some other lens.""
"20100726","4.0","quick delivery, hans't tried out yet","Quick delivery, still havn't received the camera that was in the same order, therefore hasn't had a chance to try it out.""
"20100724","5.0","Another good addition to my Canon lens collection.","I have used Canon products exclusively since my first purchase in 1960, with countless Canon cameras since my first Canon FT SLR.  I did not think that a zoom lens in this price range could be as good as this 55-250 mm is proving to be.  I would certainly recommend this lens to any Canon user who wishes to try this zoom range and is budget minded.  After doing much research concerning lens tests, etc, before my purchase, I must say that it is exceeding my expectations already.""
"20100723","4.0","Great lens period - especially for the money","I have been using the 55-250 for about 90 days. I didn't purchase it from Amazon although I wish I had. I could have saved 50 bucks. At the time I got the lens, I didn't fully understand the importance of 'fast lenses' this lens does not qualify as a 'fast lens' however, for the money...I consider this my best buy. I have the 18-55, 50mm 1.8, and the 100mm macro....all Canon. The 100mm macro is my favorite, but the 55-250 is right behind it and much more versatile. The range and the IS 'image stabilization' are the main good points of the lens. I love the fact you can go form 55-250 as the name of the lens suggests. If I had more money, I would buy a 2.8 lens...something like a 70-200 2.8 IS. However, for a quarter the price, this lens has much to offer. You will need to count on using it outside or in good light. When fully zoomed in to 250mm it's a little sketchy, but I love the lens and would buy it again today. Don't even think about getting a non IS lens that has more range but no IS! It's well worth it. If this lens was a 4.0 steady throughout the range, it would be a great lens. As it is.....it's nearly great. You just have to watch the lighting. Highly recommended especially for beginners or people on a budget. You will love it!Update after 11 months : I still have this lens after almost a year. This is relevant because I sold all variable aperture lenses except this one. With long zoom lenses like this having a variable aperture doesn't have a big downside. I still use this lens and like it. You have to be very careful with focus on long zoom shots. It will miss sometimes. I have learned to manual focus when using long zoom and it works out fine. It's very sharp if you get the focus right. I like the lens and plan to keep it. It's recommended by me. The 70-300 is another option but I have never used it. This lens is worth buying but for most others I would spend more for a fixed aperture.""

"20100718","3.0","Canon lens EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5,6 IS","The Canon EF-S 55-259mm f/4.0-5.6IS lens has plastic mounting threads.  It also has AF and IS.  A limitation of this lens is that you must take off auto focus if you wish to override the AF feature and manually focus.  With a crop sensor camera it has an effective focal length of 88-400mm, multiplier(1.6).  It uses a 58mm filter, and the lens does not rotate, having no negative impact when using polarizing filters.  It has 12 elements in 10 groups and 7 circular diaphragm blades.  This lens version was introduced in 2007 and is currently mfd.  400mm is a considerable focus length and the optics are good. The Canon 55-250mm lens is small light and inexpensive.  This lens is not compatible with full frame cameras.  Overall it is an acceptable, economical lens.""
"20100715","4.0","Good lens, not the fastest but acceptable","This lens is a decent pick if you cant or do not want to spend much more for a better lens. The image stabilization works fine especially at the telephoto end in reasonable light, it wont 'create' light like some lenses with apertures of 1.4 to 1.8 seem to do and give you good exposures in almost darkness!Its made of plastics but not as bad as some reviewers would have you think. If you are an advanced amateur/semi pro this will work just fine in reasonable light. A few have complained about the construction being of plastic and what will happen if it falls. I put it to you that any lens falling to the pavement will have some damage, plus as I said its not a pro lens or intended for such, if a pro lens is what you need you will have to pony up several times more! Finally, it was a no brainer pick for me as Amazon gave me a $200 credit with the purchase of the T2i which is a unbelievably great value of a camera, little wonder Amazon can seen to keep the camera in stock (as at the time of writing)""
"20100715","4.0","One Year Later, Still Loving It","In May of 2009 I purchased a Canon T1i, and quickly discovered that the wide angle kit lens didn't cover the focal range I would find most useful.  I seldom take pictures of buildings or scenery, or in close quarters.  When I read the reviews on this item, and saw how affordable it was, I purchased it.For the last year this has been my best friend in the field, my walk-around lens.  I do a lot of hiking in the woods and prairies of Suburban Chicagoland, and I have taken about 17,000 images with this lens in the last 12 months.  I enjoy photographing wildflowers, frogs, insects, birds, and horse competitions.  I have posted several images to the customer images area for this product.I am a petite 55 year old woman with small hands, and the T1i/55-250 combo fits me perfectly.  This lens is lightweight enough for me to lug around for hours at a time.Zooming and focusing are smooth.  The lens does not extend out when the camera is hanging from my neckstrap.  Autofocus is usually fairly quick and accurate.  In low light situations it can do quite a bit of hunting and sometimes refuses to lock into focus at all.  In those instances I flip the switch to manual focus.  In fact, when I'm photographing birds, I keep one finger on the manual focus switch because the birds are often behind branches or vegetation, making it impossible for the camera to know where I want the focus point.Photographing wildflowers in dense woods, I will often use the camera's focus assist light, followed by some fill flash, and this has worked out quite well for me.  I am considering the purchase of an LCD ringlight for next season, to throw some light on the flowers from a different angle and make it possible for me to selectively focus and avoid using the on board flash unit.The Image Stabilization does make some noise, and jerk the camera little when it kicks in.  I hardly notice that anymore.  The IS seems to do its job well.  Most of my images are clear and well focused.I do a lot of insect and frog photography, with subjects that are easily startled into flight.  I frequently shoot from just outside the lens' minimum focus distance, at 250mm, and the images are crisp enough to crop way down for more detail.  People think I have a macro lens.  I recently purchased a set of Kenko Extension Tubes, and they allow me to reduce the minimum distance between my lens and the subject.  The autofocus does not function quite as well with the tubes on, but I use this setup mainly for things that do not flee, so I just switch to manual focus for shots like this.I am not physically strong, and so I prefer not to lug around a tripod.  All of my images are hand held.  I'm sure that if I used a tripod or monopod, there would be some improvement in sharpness, but I am happy with my handheld shots.This is also my go-to lens for photographing horse sports, cross country, hunter jumper and dressage events.  I can carry it all day without tiring, and the lens keeps up with the moving focus on horses galloping straight at me using the camera's AI Servo mode.When you nail the focus dead on, you can do quite a bit of cropping to make up for the possible lack in focal length for distant subjects like birds and other flighty wildlife.Things that I find displeasing about this lens:  the front element rotates during focus, which makes it hard to use circular polarizing filters.  Also, I have a soft collapsible rubber lens hood on it which I place up against the glass in zoos, airplane windows, etc to avoid reflection,and the rotation and extension during zooming and focusing cause problems.  I don't believe this lens is compatible with the Canon 1.4 Teleconverter.  My least favorite thing about this lens is that I have to flip the switch to manual focus before I can tweak the focus, and then remember to flip it back.  I have lost some shots that way.Yes, I'm saving up for the Canon 70-200 IS f4, and a 1.4x teleconverter.  That lens solves the issues I have mentioned above with the 55-250.  Plus it is less likely to suck in dust from horse shows into the body, because it does not extend, and has better weather sealing.  And the image quality is supposed to be amazing.If you are new to DSLR photography, and want to experiment with different lenses to determine which are your favorite focal lengths, don't hesitate to purchase the Canon 55-250 f/4-5.6.  The price is right, the quality is very good, it is lightweight, well built, and holds its value for resale.  I will probably keep mine as a backup when I upgrade.  Look at my customer images for this product and I think you'll agree about the quality.""
"20100709","5.0","Good lens to complement the kit","This is a good lens for its price. Good image quality even at full zoom, quite sharp at all levels. If you have the kit lens or the 50mm 1.8 prime this is a good complement lens for zoom work. Autofocus is a bit noisy, but it is fast enough for non-pro work. the IS helps, so that is a plus. Quality of materials is not stellar, but for this level of price is quite acceptable. Highly recommended.""

"20100302","4.0","It takes patience to test a lens","I am new to DSLR photography having just moved from Canon point-and-shoot in September 2009. I purchased the Canon XSI with kit lens EFS 18-55mm and in the same order I bought the EFS 55-250mm. For the first couple months I used the full auto function and was disappointed in the results because they were not any better than the Canon PowerShot -- not bad but I expected more. Then I bought a DVD beginner course in DSLR photography for the XSI and started using the 'creative modes' and my pictures improved a great deal. I bought two more lenses the Canon EF mm50 1.4 and for some reason the competing EF mm50 1.8.So for the last few months I have been taking many pictures with all four lenses in series starting with wide aperture and incrementally closing, which of course changes shutter speed and depth of field. Then I would use the shutter priority setting and play around with the white balance and the ISO setting. Then I carefully studied the pictures on my wide screen computer monitor and increased magnification to look more closely at the edges and color. I would try to determine for each lens the affect of aperture, shutter, ISO, white balance on the quality of the pictures.I have found that I can get good and bad pictures from any of the lenses. However, the EFS 55-250 is probably the most consistent in terms of decent quality -- a little better than the kit lens. And of course it is a telephoto lens. The mm50 1.8 takes very sharp pictures but the mm50 1.4 can really take some beautiful color and the bokeh is wonderful. I like them all!I guess that as I get more experience I could change my mind and of course there is still the wonderful world of the 'L' lenses.""

"20091217","5.0","Excellent Lens","Finaly decided to take the DSLR plunge after shooting SLRs for more than 25 years.  My first SLR was a Canon AE-1 which was a fine camera for its time.  I bought this lens along with the XSi kit and with the rebate the lens cost only 69 bones.  It's an outstanding lens for that kind of money.The lens is mostly plastic but that's not necessarily bad.  In many applications plastic is superior to metal.  Good quality plastic (yes there are different grades) is lighter, cheaper and as stable and strong as metal.  I've lugged heavy metal cameras and lenses up and down mountains and through jungles and its not a lot of fun as I get older.  Most people simply do not need a lens that can be run over by a truck or thrown off of a cliff.  Plastic is just fine.  This is a great carry around lens.The speed is about average for a consumer grade lens (f/4.0-5.6).  Its very sharp throughout the zoom range.  The IS is surprisingly good even though it makes a faint clicking sound which can be annoying.  Its not an L lens but is an L lens really worh it for the hobbyist/serious amateur at 10 times the price? An amateur is better off working on his or her technique rather than spending top dollar on equipment. Whether its golf, skiing or photography, expensive equipment alone does not make you good at what you're doing.  I've seen outstanding photographs taken with pocket cameras and bad ones taken with top notch gear.  Like most things, photography comes down to the skill of the person.""

The photos I've taken with it are very sharp and the focus is very fast in day light and good indoors. If you can't afford the EF zoom lenses this is a great alternative. The image stablization works well and allows for sharp pictures in low light at shutter speeds as slow as 1/30 second.""

"20091211","5.0","Great Zoom","I'm not a photographer or an expert with lenses, but this lens has a huge zoom, much more so than the lens that comes with the canon T1i which I'm using this with. It also produces very well focused pictures. I used the lens that came with the camera the first few days but was much happier with the zoom range on this lens. It is a bit difficult though to take a picture when the subject is close, you'll definitely want to switch for those. If you can get this lens with the camera (it was 200 off when i got it), making it nearly free. If you are going to get a high end camera like the T1i, you definitely need a good zoom lens for it. Definitely would recommend this to a friend.""

After readings tons of reviews and comparing/contrasting lenses, I finally decided to get this one! When I tried it out the first time, I was pleased- more pleased than I expected. Even on a cloudy day, the quality was still there! These are a few positives and negatives about this lens:Positives:*Good quality, especially on a sunny day!*Great zoom!*Quick to put on camera body and start taking photos*Easy to zoom (almost too easy!)*Has manual/auto focus*Not too big or too small*Has image stabilizationNegatives:*some grain during cloudy days when you have to bump up the ISO*Some vignetting on full zoom*not a fast lens (which means that the F-Stop number is not low enough, which does not allow lots of light in)*NOT useful (quality-wise) indoors or night time photos*Sometimes I have to switch between my kit lens and this lens because it starts at 50mm (and I need a wider lens)*use of plastic to make this lensIt many seem like there are more negatives, but those are just the broad positives. For the money, this lens is perfect. I am very satisfied with it, and glad I bought this one. Like many people, I need a zoom lens to get the job done, not to be PERFECT in every way.

"20091204","4.0","A fantastic sidekick for the kit lens","I purchased a canon xsi with the kit lens in December of 2008 and quickly started outgrowing the kit lens. Most of my picture taking is outdoors so a long range zoom was something I was really in the market for. In july of 09 I took the plunge and got the 55-250 and now it spends more time on my camera body than anything else.It is lacking in a few areas. My copy of this lens tends to be just a little soft. Not enough to be an issue for small prints or the web, but I'm not a pro photographer by any means. The auto-focus can be a little slow (though generally faster than the kit lens) and I've had it hunt around on me a few times ( that's a few times out of nearly 8,000 photographs however, so its a rare occurrence). Also the slow aperture makes it almost impossible to use in dimmer conditions.With all that said though the image stabilization on this lens totally makes up for almost all of its flaws. Canon rates it a 4 f-stops and I have to agree. While it wont make the lens perform any better in dim conditions on a overcast to sunny day you can walk around and snap shots like nothing else I've seen. While my friend with a much better lens would have to stop and steady himself I could raise the camera (even zoomed all the way in to 250mm) and grab a clear shot almost as fast as I had the subject in frame.I can't recommend this lens highly enough to anyone looking for a cheap long range zoom. As long as can put up with a little softness and plan to use this mostly during the day you can't go wrong with the Canon 55-250mm.""

"20091114","5.0","Nice lens for the price","I have a couple of Cameras now capable of 'superzoom' functioning. A panasonic fz18, an Olympus e-510 with 70-300mm lens, and a Canon T1i with this 55-250mm lens. This lens is very good DSLR zoom lens when the price is also considered, with it just above 200 bucks now. It doesn't have the heft of the Oly 70-300mm and the build quality feels a tad bit less, but the images it produces are as good when combined with the T1i as I can get with my Olympus set-up. I didn't notice it being noisy and felt the IS system really did a good job at 250mm. As I do most of my shooting handheld I strongly recommend anything with an IS system either in the body or lens over lens without, especially when zooming. I won't have even considered the Canon 70-300mm entry level lens that lacks this. Build seems a bit better then then shorter kit lens that comes with the Rebels, and between the two I far prefer this one. I think for most Rebel users this would be the logical second lens to move to after the kit one and for the price is worth it.

Easy to use, light enough that you won't mind carrying it around in your camera bag this lens works well for those times when you want / need a telephoto lens.  My only complaint, and this is towards Canon themselves and not the lens, is that Canon doesn't provide a hood with the lens; Canon must realy think highly of their hoods as they are ridiculously expensive as an accessory.  I bought a nice Hoya hood for this lens at about 25% the cost of the Canon hood.""

At first, many of my pics at 250mm were soft, and I thought 'what can you expect.' However, when I increased the shutter speed to 1/250mm or faster, the pics became very sharp. Apparently, the IS effect is quite noticeable in the viewfinder but isn't quite translated to the pic. Perhaps, the light weight Rebel camera also has an effect. If I keep my shutter speeds up to the same as the focal length as a minimum, the pics nearly match a 70-200mm F4 L lens that I have used.

With the 18-55mm IS, any Canon EF-S shooter can have a very wide selection of focal lengths with just two lenses. They're slow lenses, but the image stabilization makes up for that in most cases.

You really need to 'twist it'. This isn't as smooth as the kit lens. It reacts like it needs some lubrication so the zoom extends more easily.

And come on, I only paid $250!The images from this lens are tack sharp with bokeh that is pleasing to the eye, though not as smooth and buttery as some would like.  For me, this is fine, as a bit of post-processing can help if needed.In most lighting (even in the dark!) this lens focuses relatively quickly compared to the Canon 18-200mm lens I'm replacing.  The only time I found it slow to focus is in very low light, low contrast scenes, with the lens zoomed past 200mm.  However, that is an issue with many zoom lenses in this price range (and higher).  IS works well and is pretty quiet. Zooming/focusing is smooth with no lens creep whatsoever.  Oh, and it doesn't drain my battery too quickly, like some competitors' zoom lenses.Also, I see NO evidence of fringing in 99% of the high-contrast photos taken with this lens on my 50D.  In the small number of pictures that display fringing, it is minimal and of a neutral color, NOT purple.  Overall, I'm very impressed with the functionality, ease of use and picture quality for the price paid.  This lens is a big winner for me and will find a happy home alongside the Canon 50mm f/1.4 and Canon 10-22mm wide angle.After trying some very positively reviewed lenses from Tamron and Sigma, I've decided no one knows Canon cameras like Canon.

The reviewers do get anal9 read critical) in their comments relative to lower f stops and at the extreme ranges of the zoom.I do not baby my gear and just got back from 14 days in utah hiking and this lens held up fine while strapped into my back pack. The images were certainly acceptable to my eyes.I am sure if I had the $1000 lens I would think differently.  Yes there are better lens both in built quality and optically at bocoo bucks.This lens complements the kit 18/55mm. My image stabilizer broke in the 18/55mm IS lens. I speculate it will also break relatively soon in this lens  but for now it works and works well. Nothing beats it optically in a zoom in this price range.In conclusion: marginal built quality, good optical results at a bargin price relatively speaking(hey I'm scotish and $250 is still a lot of money lads and lassies).""

I also have a Canon f/4.0 70-210 Telephoto Zoom lens I have had for 20 years but I have had difficulty at higher zooms in holding it anywhere near steady enough. I have only had the new lens for 2 months and have found it to be excellent at low to mid range shots but a little soft (as indicated in other reviews) at high zoom (200-250). But the stabilization has been great.I am strictly a novice but I consider it to be a reasonable buy, even with the lens I already owned. My older lens is better on a tripod I think because it is f/4.0 for all ranges. As I am semi-retired I don't have a lot of spare cash but this was still a good deal. If you need a lens for this range and can't afford $600 I would recommend the Canon EF-S 55-250 IS wholeheartedly.On a sadder note, I was photographing my brother-in-law sawing wood. I changed lenses and did not put away my 55-250. Naturally it fell off a 4 foot table onto the concrete floor.  I had a rubber lens hood on it and it has apparently protected the lens. The hood completely folded even with the lens edge but I can find no scratches (I did have a protective filter on it). Pictures at all ranges appear to be fine.  Strong recommendation -- buy a hood!!

The IS makes a real difference and outdoors the autofocus is lightening fast as long as there is a fair amount of light.

However pictures are great indoors if you can handle the easy-to-use MF.Pro: Awesome sharpnessPro: Good, solid buildPro: IS is very helpful.Pro: In decent light, the AF is very fast.Con: Auto focusing in low light is a NIGHTMARE! However, pictures turn out very well if you take the time to focus the image yourself.Con: Sometimes Auto focusing in low light can work, but when it does, the front of the lens moves so much you may need to zoom in or out more.In addition I HIGHLY recommend getting a Tiffen 58mm filter in your order. They work as good as Canon products and are much cheaper!Con: Not so good for Macro photography of close-ups. If you aren't in it to photograph flowers, this is no big deal!

But I got this lens for telezoom and it seems it gives reasonable quality for that purpose: under day light. One minor thing is that it can't catch my son running fast with 250mm zoom (f5.6), but it is expected with this slow lens. Under shade, the shutter speed gets extremely slower than under the sun, but this lens can mange the focus with IS even with 1/30s.

It is slow to focus in some situations, mainly movement of a small child.  It takes a bit of playing with to get the right settings so you have good color. Otherwise your shots can be too washed out.I think it will be great for what I intend on using it. To sit on the other side of the yard and take pics of my son playing.  I still haven't gotten to use it in bright light yet so I'll have to see what it does then, ( I have had it just two days.):)For good low light shots I'll be sticking with my 50mm.""
"20090716","4.0","Great value for its image quality and zoom range","For amateur photographers, this lens is an excellent compliment to the kit lens to extend the zoom range. With its price, it has its drawbacks: slow (4.0-5.6), auto focus some times indecisive at low light, build quality not top of the notch. But it only costs you a little more than [...] bucks. With this price, it is a good buy for its image quality and zoom range. So if you don't do a lot of indoor photographing and are not so picky about the overall build quality (actually it is not too bad to me), then this is a great one to have.""

When we both got our photos back, they were very comparable. Mine, however, was a fraction of the price and much more portable.

"20090708","4.0","Only the the price","I've been using this lens only for 3 weeks[...]The build quality is just like the same with the kit lens 18-55mm IS , which means : plastic mount , focusing rotate the front. In other words , it's the bigger kit lens with usable focus ring.Image quality is beyond what I've expected so far. I provide sharp image compare with the kit lens, but I don't think I can come close to that of an prime or L lens. Color are perfect in my taste with decent bokeh[...]Focusing in dim light is unreliable. I have to switch to manual focus all the time at night. Focusing speed is acceptable , the same as the kit lens , loud and sometimes inaccurate.anyway, it's a good lens to walk around in a nice day""

This is a great zoom lens and a very good addition to your lens collection. I find the build quality very good, as opposed to some of the reviews in here. The image stabilization comes in handy, as well. You cannot go wrong with this lens, at this price. I would highly recommend this.""
"20090618","5.0","very happy with this lens","I purchased this lens solely for the purpose of getting better, up-close action shots of my son's athletic events and so far, it does not disappoint.  With the image stabilization, I have taken crystal clear action shots of both soccer and football games that others have wowed over when I have shown them the pictures.  Even at full zoom, I can later crop the image and still have a clear, detailed picture which really helps when photographing the far side of the field of play. If you buy, I do recommend a lens filter; they cost next to nothing and will protect the lens from scratches, etc and do not distort the pictures.""
"20090617","3.0","Okay lens, good value for money, but...","I bought this lens last year and used it for a while. The pictures I got were pretty decent, and the Image Stabilization works well, but after a few months I found I was favoring other lenses. This one is currently resting in a lens bag in a drawer and isn't likely to come out anytime soon.The reasons for this are basically as follows:1. Not fast enough (f/4). Granted, we all probably take many pictures at f/4 to f/8 or more, but you can't really do decent indoor photography without a flash or studio lighting at f/4, and the inability to create very shallow depth of field at the shorter focal lengths is a problem. When possible, I try to buy lenses that can do f/2.8 or better, especially at focal lengths of 100mm or less (f/5.6 at 250mm is tolerable, but f/4 at 55mm, no).2. Not sharp enough. Sharpness isn't bad on this lens, but it's not great either.3. If a lens can do 250mm, I keep finding I want a bit more than that. But once I bought another lens that could go farther, I found I didn't need this one anymore because that lens covers most of this one's range and is a lot sharper. (It's also more than double the price, though.)So, overall, this is a pretty decent but not spectacular image-stabilized telephoto zoom lens for Canon APS-C cameras. If it's all you can afford, then you may find it satisfactory, and it's a nice companion to the EF-S 18-55mm IS lens that comes in the Rebel kits these days. But if your budget will allow you to get a better lens (or two better lenses for wider coverage), I think you'll probably be happier in the long run if you do that.""
"20090615","4.0","Which lens to get","I have a 18mm-55mm lens, and was in search for a telephoto, I read so many reviews that were so complex I didn't know what I was reading. I bought the 55mm-250mm lens and now understand some of the reviews.To break it down in simply terms:55mm (the lowest setting on the 55mm-250mm) you can not stand right on top of a subject, the lens makes you too close everything won't fit in the frame. That is Not what the lens is for & might be were some of the bad reviews come from. (Buy the 18-55mm for those close up shots)It takes time for the auto focus, it still Fast but not as fast as my 18mm-55mm. Still your not going to miss taking a picture of a bird sitting in a tree far away. But at baseball game of a kid catching a 50mph ball I missed some shots (why I gave 4 stars). Not the lens fault more mine I should have used manual focus!!On auto focus, after all it has a LOT of setting to go through 55 to 250mm settings. No duh the 18-55mm auto focus faster. Think of it as a deck of cards, you (and auto focus) can flip through 18-55 cards faster then a deck of 55-250 cards. Some of the reviews complain about the auto focus, it does work of course just not as fast as smaller lens.No matter what if you are in the back row and your son on the stage at a school play, your picture will be Prefect and it will look like you were in the front row.That is what this lens is for, where you can take time to set it up, adjust and take time to snap a picture. At a baseball game you need to use Manual focus, (you can turn the ring faster then auto) and you can get great pics, auto might let you down during fast action but not with still pictures!!I suggest getting 18mm-55mm for everyday use, for those great up close, fast action, birthday shots; I Love that lens. Then get the 55mm-250mm for those far away school plays, scenery vacation, and birds sitting in a far away tree the lens is prefect for those kinds of pictures.""
"20090610","4.0","Good value for non-pro","For the price, you are getting a good deal.  Is it the best lens out there? Not by a long shot.  But it is a solid value as far as a hefty zoom lens goes.  Unless you are going semi-pro, this is a very good lens for the pro-sumer.""
"20090609","5.0","Very nice lens","This lens is great.  Been using it for some time now with very impressive results.  Colors and saturation are amazing, clarity is perfect.  I honestly don't see the advantage of spending $1000+ on a L series lens when looking through pics taken with this lens and an L series lens leaves me not knowing the difference between the two...The AF is also quite fast and accurate.  Nice lightweight lens that is pretty compact in size and takes awesome pictures.I read reviews before purchasing to find people commenting on washed out colors...  I'm just not seeing it.  If the pictures had anymore color they'd be well over-saturated.  This may be just my experience, but this lens is highly recommended!""

I bought this Canon lens a couple of days ago from Amazon.com for 255 dollars. Two days later I saw the same lens for 237 on sale from Amazon.com. I understand that they would not match other competitors prices, but they do not match even their own price a couple of days after the original purchase. I was told by a costumer representative that they have stopped price matching their own products in 2008. It seems very cheesy that a big company like Amazon.com would instruct me to buy the lens with the new price and to return the old lens, instead of price matching their own product. Yes I am NOT talking about the same product from a different seller, but their own online store. I am NOT talking about a price match after 30 days, but after 2 days . Even Best Buy has a 15-30 day price matching policy.Cheesy if you ask me.Update 03-08-2010. In fairness this is a great lens.""

"20090601","4.0","Nice performance for a kit lens","I bought my Canon XSi just after the two lens bundle promotion, (which included this lens), ended, leaving me with the option of purchasing either the body only or an 18-55 lens combo bundle.  I chose the bundle for the wide lens, but I still needed a zoom lens.  I decided on this zoom as an initial zoom lens.  I figured it would be sufficient for the time being.  Expecting typical ho-hum performance common with less expensive glass, I must say this lens pleasantly surprised me.  Images are vivid, crisp, and sharp.  It has sufficient speed to freeze fast moving action in good light, especially outdoors.  Things stay nice and clear even at the far end of the zoom.  Image Stabilization works very well and is most appreciated when shooting at full zoom.  The lens is very lightweight and easy to carry. Indoor performance is great as well, however the slow lens starts to show its limitations as the light fades.  Regardless, the photos are still much better than low-light shots taken with point and shoot cams costing double the price of this lens, or more; although it's not exactly the faster Canon 70-200mm F/2.8L lens that I eventually plan to purchase either.  If you need a decent zoom lens and you're not a professional photographer or advanced amateur, get this and save your money (unless you have money to burn).  Trust me, you won't regret it, especially if you can score this lens as part of a bundle.""
"20090601","5.0","Great lens, at a REAL great price","I realize that this is by far not the greatest lens, but for the price it is to me, a newcomer to the Digital SLR world, this lens great, as far as price in concerned.  I would rather get real acquainted with my camera a lot more, before I go out and purchase an expensive lens.  That way later I would know what I want in a better lens, and I will truly see the difference, between the two.  It really compliments the 18-55mm kit lens that came with my XSi.  I am sure that I would probably need more reach, but that would have to come later.""

For the price, you can't beat this lens.If you are an amateur photographer on a budget, this is perfect for you.  Professionals will find little flaws and nit-pick, but an amateur won't even notice those things.""

Everyone comments on the sharpness and color clarity of my photos with this combination.""
"20090529","5.0","Exceeded Expectations.","I didn't expect it to be a bad lens, but given the price I certainly didn't expect the quality that I found with this lens. I have shot extensively with the $1800 70-200MM f/2.8 IS and I have to say this lens comes much closer than I thought to its performance. You will be hard pressed to find any difference in sharpness, and I believe the IS on this lens even works better since it is a newer generation of the technology. This lens does have barrel distortion where the 70-200mm has none. It also can't hold a candle to it in terms of low-light performance. The thing is, though, the distortion was correctable easily in PS and as far as the low-light performance goes I wouldn't bring this to shoot a wedding anyway. I bought it for a specific purpose--I needed a lens quick and I needed a small/light one for shooting only in the the daytime on a long vacation--and it did everything I needed and more. I have already sold a few photos that were taken with this lens! The 400mm reach (this is a 400mm lens on all supported bodies which are 1.6x crop factored) is amazing and I found no loss in sharpness at any focal length. I have been similarly pleasantly surprised in the past by low-cost Canon zoom lenses so maybe I should have seen this coming, but I would recommend this lens to anyone other than someone doing a low-light/professional gig. Given the performance for the cost this lens should be more than suitable for amateurs and semi-pros alike.Pros: Sharpness, IS technology, cost/value, size/weightCons: Mild (but correctable) distortion, zero low-light capability except at unusably high-ISOsJust get yourself a Rebel, a wide-angle or wide-angle zoom lens, this lens, a big memory card--and you're done. Worry about the rest later.""

This lens was excellent for my uses. I was able to get the handshake picture from 40 yards away. It was a great day and I was made happier I captured the moments with this lens. I was also happy at the quick turnaround in getting the lens. I was not sure I was going to have the camera for graduation - then once I got it - I needed to capture longer distant pictures to make the camera effective for indoors and a ceremony.Other shots taken - Speaker pictures, presentation pictures, - even took a few shots of the campus.....I could explain more technically the ability for the lens to work, but there are many other reviewers that would do a much better job on that.""
"20090528","5.0","Great Lens, especially for the $$ !!!","I needed a lens to use for my children's sporting events.  I had purchased a non-IS lens and the results were poor.  This lens, however, provides clear and crisp shots for soccer, t-ball and fast moving lacrosse events.  I find the focus to be sufficiently quick.  Compact size is very nice too.In this price range, I would highly recommend this zoom lens.""
"20090524","4.0","The "IS" is worth it.","If you're looking at this lens then you've probably found out you have 3 choices.  You could get this one, get the 75-300mm with no image stabilization (IS), or the 75-300mm USM with IS.For me the 75-300mm USM with IS was too expensive.  I really wanted the IS but I was worried about only getting 250mm worth of zoom.  In my opinion, the IS is better than getting the extra 50mm.  A friend of mine had the 75-300mm without IS and I couldn't hold it steady at full zoom which resulted in blurry images.The IS in this lens lets you zoom all the way out and still have a fairly slow shutter speed.  The focus speed is comparable to the kit lens on the XSI (25-55mm IS), which is fine for me.  I haven't had a shot yet where I wished I had the extra zoom.This is not meant for a professional sports photographer, but it's great for a parent like me who wants to get great shots of the kids on the ballfields.I would have given it 5 stars if it was a USM lens.If you have the money, go with the 75-300mm USM with IS.  If not, get this one.""

"20090515","3.0","Great lens if you will be satisfied with reach","I bought this lens when I got my XSI based on the mostly glowing reviews. One reviewer noted that the 55-250 can be used with the Canon 250 D to shoot macro, and I did purchase the diopter as well and have enjoyed doing some macro with this lens.  However, my big disappointment has been at the other end of the spectrum.  While 250 mm on a APS-C sensor seems like a long reach, I found that I've missed opportunities to capture wildlife and especially birds because the telephoto just isn't long enough.  Although you can get a close up lens to use with the 55-250, you can't use a teleconverter with any EF-S lens.  So...I ended up getting a cheap Tamron 75-300 and a Tamron 1.4 teleconverter for the price I paid for this lens.  To my surprise, I have not missed the Image Stabilization though the Tamron lens is not as light as this lens.  If I had it to do over again, I would not get an EF-S lens even at this great price.  For an even better price, I could have purchased a 28-80 and a 75-300 Tamron, though without the Image Stabilization.  Oh well, hindsight is 20-20.""

For a casual amateur photographer, I am very pleased with the result.  For its range, you will most likely use this lens outside where there is a lot of light; or with a tripod at night.  The lens is slower.  But that is why you pay a lot less (and also because of its plastic construction).The image stabilizer is a must for zoom lens and it works.Lens is very light.  No wonder it feels like a toy to some.  Real glass lenses make your camera front heavy.At its widest, the view is the closest zoom of the lens that came with the Rebel if you bought it as a set.  If you want a more versatile lens, get an 18-200mm lens.  Don't make the same mistake I did if you are just buying your second lens.  Get the 18-200mm so you do not have to keep switching lens from wide to zoom and from indoor to landscape.It is a lot of fun to have a long zoom.  Now you can shoot pictures that showcase greater depth-of-field.  It makes your pictures more dramatic when the subject stands out from the background.  You can also take more candid pics.  Great for people who are camera conscious.""
"20090215","4.0","Lightweight lense","This lense (EFS 55-250 IS) a very good lense for the price. The optics are good for an amateur/enthusiast like me. The buiild is light-weight plastic. The telephoto has a nice smooth action. Compared to my FD Canon lenses it feels less substantial and more delicate and I find myself being much more careful with it.  When I started using the lense out of the box the IS sounded like it was quietly grinding coffee. I could also see my image jump in the view finder quite regularly. The noise and image anomaly has quieted down within a few days of use (or maybe I just got used to it).  Some claim this noise is normal for this lense.  Nonetheless, if you have a XS or XSi budget this is the telephoto for you.""
"20090215","4.0","Great value!","I got this lens along with my XSI while Canon had a $[...] instant rebate, so this lens really only cost me a little over a hundred bucks.  It is definitely worth the $[...] that Amazon normally charges for it.  If you are a casual photographer like me and can not shell out thousands of dollars on lenses, this is a must have.  It may not be the most well built lens in the canon line, but it feels much more solid than the kit lens.  I had the chance to check out the 70-300 IS USM in Circuit City not too long ago and I felt like the manual focus was a little sloppy and the body itself felt a little light for the size.  The image quality might be a shade better and the USM might be faster, but after holding the lens, I was glad I didn't shell out the extra $[...].  I have been able to take some wonderfully crisp indoor shots with this lens using my tripod and shutter release.  The weather has been a little chilly and I have not felt like doing much outdoor shooting, so I can not speak to the effectiveness of IS for hand held shots.  If you are a novice and looking for a good starter zoom lens, this is it.  I love this lens and am completely satisfied for now.  When I decide that I can justify spending a thousand dollars on the 300 F4L, I may stop loving this lens, but for now this lens has been great.""

"20090209","5.0","My first l`","I mounted the 55-250mm ES Canon lens on my rebel XSI and put it to its first challenge.  Basketball tournament in a poorly lit gym.  The stabilized lens gave me another f-stop and I was able to achieve good exposure at 160/sec. pushing the camera asa to 1600.  Even my short 18-55 kit lens required more light under the same conditions.  This lens has nice reach and can get you in on all the sports action from the side line.I love this lens for the money and it came right away hassle free from Amazon.com.I recommend this lens for a nice addition to your camera bag, well worth the money.  It feels a little cheap but it is light weight.""
"20090205","5.0","Great telephoto lens to complement your kit lens","This is the first lens that I've purchased and kept outside my kit lens (18-55). I mentioned kept because believe it or not, I bought the 70-200 F4L non-IS. I won't be giving any technical review about this lens as that is pretty much covered by the other reviewers here. I'll just share my story to help out other beginners who are having a hard time as well contemplating on what lens to get to complement their kit lens.At first, I definitely wanted to buy a telephoto lens so I can shoot objects from a distance and I really like to try the lens out in a zoo. I then narrowed my choices between EF 70-300 IS USM and 70-200 F4L non-IS (didn't want 55-250 then because I didn't like the plastic mount). Since the latter would end up costing almost the same or even less (comes with hood and pouch plus the free filter amazon offers), I went for it without even thinking. Before the package arrived, I already had second thoughts and tried to cancel the item. Since I tried out the amazon prime 2 day shipping, the package came really fast so I wasn't able to cancel but returned it as soon as I got it.So why did I return the 70-200 F4L and settled for an EF-S 55-250?- I don't get paid taking pictures, it's just a hobby.- No one will really sit down and scrutinize the pictures I take. All Canon lenses take great shots compared to other brands. It's not like I'm posting the pictures I take in the net for public view.- The beige color of the L lens is somewhat too loud for me. I don't want people to think I have that much cash or evern comment that I only have an XS body.- No IS, I realized that I really need IS because I don't have any plans of getting a tripod soon and my hands are really shaky.- Cost!- Weight.- Performance of 55-250 that I was able to research over the net. Of course it's nothing comapred to the L lens, no doubt about that. But if the pictures are viewed alone, without comparing to L lens, they are great.- Max range is only at 200, I get an extra 50mm with 55-250.- Missing the 56-69 mm.Ok, the last 2 are just for my piece of mind because I opted with 55-250 but they don't really matter if you have the L lens. If you do become a pro in the future, you'd definitely get something better than the 70-200 F4L.Bottom line, this lens is no where in the league of L lenses. As one of the reviewers mentioned, it does the job. For value of money, I really love this lens. About the plastic mount, I realized that I wouldn't be using my camera that hard anyway. Plus, it'll be lighter.I'm going to steal one of the reviews I read, it basically says that if you like the performance of your kit lens (18-55), you'll defintely like this as well. I totally agree, fast AF, sharp pictures, longer range version of 18-55.Note that this is NOT a comparison between L lens and 55-250, or even 70-300. Just a decision experience that I wanted to share with a number of beginners out there.""
"20090131","5.0","A lot of lens for not too much money","Background:  I'm an amateur photographer (hobbyist, really), and most of my experience before the past year has been with film.  My digital SLR is a Canon 20D.I love this lens!  I bought it after reading a lot of reviews, and figured it would suit my needs for the short term.  To be honest, I doubt I'll sell it even if I come up with the money to buy L quality lenses;  it's got a reasonably quick focus, a great range, and the IS works well.  My copy, at least, has been reliably sharp, with no real noticeable aberrations anywhere in its range.Is it an L quality lens?  No.  Is it a great lens at a very low price?  Oh yeah.

"20090111","5.0","Great Lens!","Just received my Canon 55-250mm lens a couple days ago.  Did my first experimental shoot with it yesterday.  I am not at all disappointed.  I do not see how anyone can go wrong purchasing this lens.  Don't let the rather low price (especially for an IS lens) fool you.  I have never owned an L lens - so I can't compare -- and I have no doubt that it really can't compare.  But hey,, if I could afford to by L lenses,, I most likely would not be using an XTi.  Don't misunderstand what I am saying.  The XTi is great,, as is the 55-250 IS lens.  My main focus is nature / macro.  For that I use a Sigma 50mm macro and Sigma ring flash.  But too many times when I was out on one of my macro shoots I ran across something that required me to reach out.  This lens will do just that,, and do it very well.  Additionally, I shoot and digitally process somewhat in the abstract mode.  Truly,, you can not go wrong with this lens.  Most of my photography is nature,, and I do not use a tripod.  The 'IS' really, really works.  I was blown away.Conclusion:  After all my rambling, if you are looking for a lens in this range (mm wise) and don't have tons of disposable cash to throw around, DO NOT HESITATE.  Buy it..""
"20090111","4.0","great lens Xsi","The Canon Xsi package we bought came with an 18-55 fairly fast lens. I wanted a telephoto lens that went to 300 or more for mostly outdoor and sports shots, but the economy tanked... I couldnt bring myself to spend $$$ for my hobby. I started looking at Tamron and Vivitar as a solution, and while I own both for my old analog slr. I wanted to take full advantage of the Image Stabilazation and AutoFocus features on the Xsi. I have mixed and matched camera, flash, and lens brands in the past and knew there might be some issues.I have used this lens a number of times in High school basketball games. I am very pleased with it. You can buy faster lenses, but for the money... this little lightweight lense is great! I get a few blurred shots when setting courtside at girls games. A few more blurred shots in boys games. But all in all... not many. And usually the blur is the ball or the feet or hands, which add an element of motion to the shot.This has been a great lens for the action shots I want to take, it is great for the outdoor shots I take while motorcycle touring, is great for low light with a tripod. Shooting in RAW lets me clean up about any mistakes I make with software. (Except for blurred or out of focus shots), no software can fix those. The price was right. I read some reviewers talking about how light weight and cheezy it felt. Hey, I like the lightness of it. I have this sucker strapped to my neck and light is good.I got a lot of lens for my dollar, coupled with a very capable camera, it is a good combination for recreational photography.I ordered through Amazon, It was at my door in SC OKlahoma within 3 days.thanks,""

I don't have a bunch of lenses lying around so I can't compare it to any other lens.  For the basic user (like me) here is what I found:1) the basic lens that comes with the Canon cameras goes up to 55mm.  This is not very much but I did notice when using this new lens that we had a hard time zooming out so we could get everything inside a room.  I don't know as any lens can do it all but you will want to keep your old lens.2) if you get a zoom lens, you will want IS.  I talked to a couple of friends that went the cheap rout because they didn't know why the IS lens cost so much.  They said that unless you are outside on a very sunny day, the non-IS lens is worthless.3) If your wife wants it for Christmas (like mine) you will score major points with this lens :-)""
"20090104","5.0","new favorite lens","I have the rebel xti and currently have the 18-55mm that came with it, and the 50mm f1.8, but I needed a little more focal range. I opted for the 55-250mm with IS not only for the increased focal range but also for the amazing price. Although it is plastic, the lens has a good, sturdy feel. The image stabilization is spectacular and has made photo opportunities that were previously impossible for me a breeze. If you are debating between this and the 70-300 with IS, though I have not used it, I would recommend this. For only 50mm more focal range and the price increase I couldn't see how the 70-300 could be worth it. I am considering eventually getting a 1.4x teleconverter that will bump this lens up to a max 350mm for only around $130, however it will need to be used mainly for outside photography due to its decrease in aperture. Well done, Canon.""

"20081230","5.0","Great Performance for the Price","The Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6IS Lens boasts great performance for the reasonable price.  I shoot with this lens on a Canon Rebel XSi as my primary telephoto lens while I collect my funds for an L series zoom.Image quality on this lens is great, especially outdoors on a bright day, it captures great colors and details.  Images tend to loose sharpness in most cases when set at 250mm although the images still turn out nicely.  The auto focus works well and generally fast, though a few times it struggled find the right object to focus on and a few times struggled to focus on anything at all; these few cases by no means drop the quality of this lens.  the image stabilizer also works very nicely.  I was shooting an Indiana Hoosiers game in Assembly Hall (anyone who has been to Assembly Hall knows how poorly lit the arena is unless you are right down on the floor) and was worried about the poor quality of the shots since I did not have floor seats and knew this lens wasn't the fastest.  Much to my chagrin, the vast majority of the pictures turned out to be a boon to my collection.While there are many other lens that have much superior optics and build quality, I simply must give this lens five stars for the fact that it gives GOOD performance at a GREAT price.  It is not without its quirks, but i would recommend this lens to anyone with a limited budget looking for a good telephoto lens.""

Please note that I have never had my hands on an L-series lens and will not be reviewing this item as if I had...plus it wouldn't be fair anyway.From what I have noticed thus far, the color saturation is quite good in comparison to my other lenses.  Bokeh is adequate and shows great depth of field when proper settings are applied.  Although many have complained about the build quality of this lens, I cannot.  Yes, it is plastic...but higher quality plastic in comparison to what I have.  I now feel more complete as I have drastically improved my range with this one purchase.The only drawback to this lens is the elongating & rotation when focusing on the subject.  Yes, this can be solved with the purchase of a USM lens, but the value of this lens is far too great.  But to counter that, the motor is actually much quieter than my other 2 lenses.Magazines have raved about it.  Users have expressed overall satisfaction.

"20081013","5.0","Best lens for the money","This is an excellent lens for under $500.  It is designed to be a good all purpose tele zoom lens for non-pros.  I think it fits the bill nicely.  The lens is very sharp at all focal lengths and really doesn't have any bad spots like most cheap lenses.  Aperture is a bit on the slow side, but normal for a lens in its class.  The Image Stabilization really works well.  You won't want a telephoto lens without it once you've had it.  Build quality is about normal for the price.  It is mostly plastic, but that keeps down on the weight.  Macro performance is pretty good, too.  It is a 1/3 magnification, which is a bit better than average without being an advertised macro lens. You can certainly fill the frame with a flower bud or a leaf, if that is what you are after.  I give it 5 stars, not because it is the best lens in the world, but because it is the best lens for the price and the intended photographers.  It pairs perfectly with the 18-55 IS and then you get a seamless range of 18-250 (28-400 equiv), all Image stabilized.  The next step up is at least twice the money.  Nothing else in the price range can compare with the features, sharpness and focal range in my opinion.""

So when I saw this lens 250mm (similar to 400mm on full-frame) with a reasonable price, I grabbed it.The colors are rendered well, the IS works like a charm.Note - this is an EF-S lens so you won't be able to use it on a full-sensor camera body later - only on the cropped-sensor cameras like the Rebel XTi.My reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it occasionally gets confused while focusing.  (I use spot-focus mostly - perhaps that has something to do with it.)  If it happens, I zoom back to 55mm, focus, and then re-zoom, focus and it's all set.While I haven't had it for long yet, I was able to get some very nice photos with this lens - one close-up shot all the way down a church aisle of someone performing at the other end in front of the church at night, close-up shots of bees in flight, dragonflies, etc.The front element rotates but I would never think of using a polarizer on a zoom lens like this since you've already lost a lot of light.Am I happy I bought it?  Absolutely.""
"20080714","5.0","Canon EF-s 55-250 Zoom","Outstanding Lens. This is my third lens for my Canon Digital Rebel XTi. Would highly recommend over the 70-300 non image stabilized canon lens. The Image stabilizer makes all the difference in photo quality when zoomed in on far away objects. I cannot say enough about this lens. I used it at the zoo, and never switched it out with any other lens. You can use it for pretty close up, but also very far away objects. Never felt like I couldn't get close enough to the what I was taking a picture of. Very reliable and fast focusing as well. Great at sporting events.""

"20080702","5.0","Sharp lens ... amazing IS!!","I bought this lens mainly for the focal length and the IS feature. I figured that I would replace the lens within a year, once I had enough money because I was expecting this lens to be a typical mediocre lens. When I took picture of this lens to test it out, I was amazed. This lens is sharp at wide open apertures. I have taken pictures with many lenses (L class included) and this lens is a rarity in that it was sharpest wide open at each focal length.The IS on this lens is unbelievable. I was able to take pictures at such low shutter speeds that I could have never been able to do without IS. The IS makes a little bit of noise (VERY minimal) which makes me happy because it shows you that it is working. I know you may not believe me, but I was able to take a picture at 1/15 at a focal length of 250mm and the image was sharp at 100% ... no blur.The focus is pretty good, but not as fast or sure as USM focus. The construction of this lens is not that of an L class, but for the price you paying, that is expected.In my opinion, you get a lens to take good pictures and this lens does that, and some. I don't buy lenses for their construction because I am not a photographer that would ever need a metal lens construction. Actually I would prefer this construction because it is so much lighter and easier to carry around. The only legitimate complaint about this lens is the focus, but it is still not an issue at all if you are in a place that is not dark. But then again, why would you be using this lens in the dark with f/4..0-5.6 as its largest aperture.In summary: if you want a lens that takes sharp pictures with a nice telephoto range of focal lengths and some great IS, then this is the lens for you.""
"20080628","5.0","Wonderful lens, wonderful price","I'll keep it simple. If you shoot weddings or events, buy this lens. I've made shots with this lens that I was taught were impossible without a tripod. 400mm (equiv) at 1/25th of a second? Sure, why not!If you can afford a 70-300 IS or a 70-200 IS, great. But I'd recommend you try this lens first. Most folks will find they won't need one of those more expensive lenses.Updated 10/3The lens is still exceeding my expectations for a lens at this price.

"20080625","5.0","Great Lens for the Price","I recently had our twin daughter's Pre-K graduation and dance recital before going on vacation for a week. I flip-flopped on whether I should purchase the 55-250 or go with the Canon 75-300 USM. After testing out both lenses at the J&R, I went with the 55-250.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied. I can take photos of images I've missed in the past. Images are sharp. Colors pop. The auto-focus and image stabilization work well. Using the EOS software included with the Canon xSi, I can fine-tine the photos to my liking.I've read comments that that build is plastic and flimsy. I have not found this to be the case. It's just as sturdy as the 18-55 kit lens included with the Xsi.Could you get slightly sharper images from the 75-300. You may be able to, but is it worth double the price and extra weight. If you are simply looking to get great photos of family members, special events, vacations with image stabilization and auto-focus, the Canon 55-250 lens cannot be beat for the price.""
"20080623","5.0","Just Wow","All I can say is wow. This lens just came in today so lots left to discover but wow. I have had my xt for three years now and had given up hope of taking the pics I really wanted. I took this lens outside and got some flower pictures, then went inside and took some more pics. I have the kit lens 18-55mm and also the 75-300usm, and the 50mm lens thats so popular, I have never been able to get pics like the ones I snapped today! This lens puts off a new camera body for a long while, in short it is nothing less than great. This is what I bought the Rebel XT to do. The color, contrast, clarity is suddenly all there. I bet alot of you bought a dslr to take great pics, or much better than a point and shoot, well this lens puts you there. I notice that the newer consumer dslr bodies come with an IS lens and this is no coinsidence as its the lens that is making your pictures so much better. I highly recommend it as it is the best purchase I've made in a long time even in auto mode!""
"20080617","4.0","as it says on the tin","A clear case of getting what you pay for. If you want a professional quality lens, Canon make them: go ahead and spend $2000. This lens costs a lot less and some compromises have to be made. It gets very long at 250mm and it feels a bit flimsy. There's nothing wrong with the images though. They are sharp and contrasty and the IS works pretty well.""
"20080613","5.0","Excellent value","This is a very good lens given its price.  Like with any lens selection thereare compromises, and a more expensive lens is not necessarily better in allrespects.  These are the main considerations for me:*  The lens comes with an excellent IS.  One could probably save a hundred bucksbuying a non-IS lens in this focal range which may even be a bit better optically.However, long range shots without IS are difficult, especially in low light.  TheIS on this lens works very well, better compared to my Canon 28-135 IS and evencompared to the 100-400L.  The IS really makes a lot of hand held shots possiblethat one could not do with a non-IS lens.*  The lens is fairly cheaply built and has a plastic mount.  However, thetrade-off is that it is also fairly small and light (the small size is also dueto the fact that it is a EF-S lens).  My other tele-zoom is a 100-400L lenswhich is built like tank, but it is also huge and weighs 3 pounds.  In many casesone does not want to carry that much weight around, and that is where this lenscomes in really handy.*  Image quality:  No, it cannot quite match the 100-400L, but it comes surprisinglyclose.  Of course, the 100-400L costs 5 times as much.  Lack of good colorsaturation is the most notable deficiency.  On the other hand images are very sharp.For outdoors one should get a hood, there is quite a bit of glare in shots withfrontal sunlight.*  Zoom range:  the 55-250mm range makes the lens quite versatile.  250mm is longenough for most outdoor sports, many nature shots, people from afar, etc.  At theother end 55mm is still good for close action, for example at a soccer field.That is almost a factor 2 shorter compared to 100-(300/400) lenses.It also provides a nice overlap with walk-around lenses, like the Canon 28-135 IS.*  Aperture:  F4-5.6 is nothing to brag about, however, a faster lens would alsohave to be much bigger, heavier, and costlier.  And as long as you objects don'tmove too much the IS makes the lens effectively faster.  If Canon's 4 stopimprovement holds it would be equivalent to a non-ISF1-1.4, although F1.4-2 isprobably more realistic.  A F1.4-2  with that focal range would have to be big,heavy, and expensive, if it even existed.In summary, this is an excellent second lens to complement a short zoom or awalk-around lens.  Very versatile and a lot of bang for the buck.  In my case,even though I own a 100-400L I still keep this lens because it is often morepractical because of the shorter focal length and the smaller size.""
"20080611","5.0","What a steal!","This lens really takes wonderful photos for such a great price. I've taken the lens with me everywhere and get excellent shots in every lighting environment and at any time of the day. I have the Canon Digital Rebel XTi and the lens and camera make a wonderful team for this entry level photographer!""
"20080610","5.0","What a great deal for the price","For the price, you can't find any other lens to beat it. Image Stabilizer is very helpful as a telephotolens. The image quality (sharpness, saturation, and contrast) is just superb. Focal range is very useful for a 1.6x crop body. One more important pro is its size and weight (only 10.8cm long and 390g). The only cons are small aperture and AF speed in low light (sometimes hunt for a while in low light condition). Highly recommanded!""
"20080610","5.0","As Described","I am very new to DSLR photography and this lens was everything advertised.  I based my decision on other user reviews and couldn't be happier.  Would definitely recommend this lens to any new user like myself as very versatile.""
"20080603","4.0","Great bang for the buck","The 55-250 provides a very decent photo across its zoom range.  IS works great. Probabaly the biggest drawback is the fact the lens turns when focusing making it a bit more complicated to use a polarizer.""
"20080529","4.0","Great lens for the price","This is one of Canon's cheapest lens. The lens mount is plastic, the AF is slow, the front element rotates and extends when focusing, it is somewhat soft at the long end, and contrast is OK to good.Note the part about front element extending. This means that when packing the lens away, you will most likely need to switch to MF and then turn the focusing ring to retract the lens to the most compact size.So why 4 stars?Low price, light weight makes it a great lens to bring on a casual trip when you need telephoto occasionally. Has IS (which works, mostly) and decent magnification (0.31x at full zoom). Images are reasonably sharp.I wouldn't bring this lens (except as a backup) if I'm going on a safari. But at this price, I wouldn't hesitate getting one just for occasional telephoto in good light.""
"20080528","5.0","Bang for the Buck","For the price paid, I can't imagine you would find much better.  Yes, it is plastic and yes it doesn't have the quality of an L Series lens, but considering the price, I think you get a lot more than what you pay for.The image stabilization is really pretty good on this.  I was surprised to shoot slow shutter speeds with the zoom out and be able to maintain decent images still.I would definitely recommend this lens.""
"20080509","3.0","Good, but not great.","This lens can be summed up by the simple statement of 'Good, but not great.'  It gets the job done without really excelling at it, and it is definitely not without its issues.  That being said, you can't beat the price - depending on what you're looking for.The price doesn't lie, and though the lens takes good pictures and offers a decent feature-set (IS under $300), it's not a top performer.  Bokeh is a bit harsh, AF is somewhat slow and low-light is pretty much out.  If you want to make a hobby out of shooting long focal lengths, do yourself a favor and give this a pass.However, if you're more of a landscape photographer (like me) looking for nothing more than an adequate long-tele lens while you're spending your money on the awesome 10-22mm or a good 17-50mm f/2.8, this lens fits a VERY needed place in your bag..  A 70-200L f/4, it ain't - but it's also not $1,000.All in all, you get what you pay for and it's good (bordering on sufficient) without being great at anything.  It's a terrific buy for someone like me who looks at the tele- end of focal lengths as 'that occasional odd shot I don't want to miss.'  It'd be bloody horrible if I actually used it as a regular lens - but then, I didn't pay the same amount for it that I have for my wider lenses.""
"20080506","5.0","reasonable value","Since I mostly use wide-angle lenses, I was not willing to blow a ton on expensive/heavy telephoto lenses for occasional shots. Prior to owning this lens, I had a Sigma 70-300 APO zoom telephoto that produced good colors, but was essentially useless due to frequent camera shake. I sold the lens and got this Canon zoom.a) Surprisingly, it CAN produce pretty sharp pictures if the subjects don't move fast. The sharpness is very comparable with two other lenses I own,  the famed and breathtakingly sharp Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 and Sigma 30mm f/1.4. While the Tamron and Sigma get sharp shots without too much work, this Canon needs a bit of careful handling to get equally sharp shots even at the wide end. I use the word 'can', because to achieve it you would either need a tripod or high ISO (my rebel XT's 1600 is pretty much what I use all the time with this lens).b) The colors in bright light are almost always faded (sharp, but faded). It can be patially corrected in Lightroom, but a bit unfortunate since this lens really needs the bright light for a good shutter speed. Indoors, it produces good color balance/saturation, but struggles to have a decent shutter speed. Kind of catch-22 situation.c) The construction is pretty cheap, but generally nothing to worry about if handled gently. However, the filter threads are thin plastic and I almost damaged the threads when putting on filters for the first time. I got a dedicated Sigma DG 58mm UV filter permanently affixed on it so that any other filters/screw hood will only go on the metal thread of the UV filter and not the lens thread directly. A metal UV filter is a must if you don't want to permanently damage the lens filter threads.d) The opteration of the IS is quiet unless you are particularly listening to it. My Tamron's AF makes more noise.e) After playing with this lens for sometime, I have come to the conclusion that IS is an absolute must on a zoom telephoto when hand held. Being the cheapest IS telephoto on the market today, there is really no equivalent for this in this price range.f) IS has been of no use in freezing subject motion. While this is to be expected, it highlights how slow a lens this really is.g) No hood comes with the lens, but I got a third party 77mm screw telephoto metal hood and step up adapter rings.h) 1 year canon warranty sucks big time compared to the 6-year Tamron and 4-year Sigma (for DG lens).i) this is a very light lens, much lighter than my sigma or tamron. Very easily carried around (hood might add a bit more bulk, but not too much).In short, this lens performs great with regards to sharpness and IS. It leaves a lot to be desired in color saturation and flare control, almost always requiring some kind of post processing to achieve desired result.Update 10/22/08----------------I bought a 58mm Canon 250D close up filter for this lens and now I have a fantastic macro lens, that is capable of doing 1:1 macro with a working distance of 25cm (~10')! The 250D is roughly 1/7 th the price of the closest 1:1 macro lens with the same working distance - the tamron 180mm 1:1 macro if you were planning on getting a seperate macro lens. The 250D is optically optimized for lens up to 135mm focal length, but the results are fantastic handheld up to 200mm on this lens. Using 250mm (when you get a bit higher than 1:1) is a little bit of work, but gets decent results (with mirror lockup + tripod + f/25). No horrible color fringing that happens with cheap closeup filters on the market (like the Opteka +1,+2,+4, and +10 close up filters). I haven't used a true 1:1 macro lens, which I suspect will definitely be better quality-wise, but the combination of a canon 55-250mm IS + canon 250d for a telephoto + 1:1 macro + IS under 400$ is a true bargain along the lines of the 50mm f/1.8.""
"20080417","5.0","IS is the way to go","okay so granted i just got this lens today and have limited use with it but i also own a canon 70-200 L series lens WITHOUT stabilization and the difference to me was immediately apparent.  i am not one to carry around a tripod which is what you need with my other lens in order to get a clear shot all of the time. yes this lens does feel much cheaper and it was! but the point and shoot shots came out much clearer.  i did not notice any color differences between the two lens as mentioned in a previous review. and i also gained mm on both ends which fits nicely with the kit lens. i am so satisfied that after one day  i have already placed my other lens for sale on ebay.  any takers!""
"20080402","4.0","Decent for the price","I just got this lens a little over a month ago and have been steadily using it since. Compared to other lenses I've bought, it's a good deal for the price.On the downside, if you're used to a lens that can go to 300mm this may not be the lens for you. I have to say sometimes I miss the extra 50mm. On the upside, the image stabilization works great and you get some really clear action shots that other lenses would blur.One annoying thing is the autofocus - in lower light, it takes a while to focus and often changes the zoom and loses your original shot. Gets kind of irritating, but that's what I get for using autofocus like a chump. :-)""

"20080326","4.0","The Good and The Bad...","I have had this lens for a couple months on my XTI.  I purchased it from Canada and it has North American warranty (both Canada and the U.S.) so I'm safely assuming it will be the same lens released here in May.After hundreds of shots so far here are my thoughts:The bad:-On my copy the color is off. Skin colors have a slight gray hue and colors are not very saturated.  In order to get vibrant hues post-processing is necessary.-Front element rotates and extends while zooming-It is an EF-S lens.  Are you planning on upgrading to full frame soon?  I am not so this is not necessarily 'bad' but can be to those who are uninformed about the compatibility issues with this lens.-People often complain about the quality of the plastic build.  I am okay with it since this lens is a place holder until I have the money for an L class lens.  I would rather have this lens now so I can capture the photos in this range than wait 6 months to a year until I can drop a couple grand on the lens I really want.-Although it overlaps some with my Tamron 28-75 (which I absolutely adore)I like having the versatility to get a bit wider with this lens.  It keeps me from carrying an extra lens when I know I will be shooting at the longer end but I still have the freedom to zoom out a bit to get more landscape if the moment strikes me.The good:-Sharp photos-Decent bokeh-IS is amazing on this lens.  Shot a performance on a dimly lit stage at the long end of the zoom (5.6) without the flash and 85% of my images came out sharp.  However, please realize IS controls the PHOTOGRAPHER'S shake/movement NOT NOT NOT the movement of the subject.  So with the 15% of the images that weren't sharp (or flat out blurry) the subject moved at a decent rate.  If you want to stop movement in less than bright environments a faster lens (2.8, 1.8, or 1.2) is necessary.  Also, on my copy the IS is dead silent and I do not have the noise problem the other reviewer was describing.-For the PRICE you will not find another lens in the 50-250-ish range with this level of performance, IS, and image quality.  OF COURSE the 70-200's are better.. several hundred to thousands of dollars better.  Cannot compare with Canon's L class lenses although people will (and have)...Lost one star because of the less than vibrant colors and other reasons noted above... I almost want to give this lens 3.5 stars because I am not enamored with as many of the photos I have gotten out of this lens as I thought I would.  I had the Sigma 70-300 APO (before they made the DG version) prior to this lens and I loved the color rendition. However, the lens lacked IS which cut out its ability to capture numerous shots. The Sigma is now broken and sitting on a shelf in case anyone was wondering why it was replaced.""
"20080318","5.0","I Love It For IS and Zoom Range at this Price, Not Pure Performance","I was determined to love this lens based on the specs and price point alone. Canon really needed to come out with this lens at this price because Nikon offers a very decent Vibration Reduction lens at roughly the same range for the same price, leaving me to make apologies for Canon and their neglect to all my Nikon friends.The IS can be switched off to save battery life but I haven't noticed a difference in battery performance with it.  The IS is only activiated when you press the shutter halfway for auto focus.  Although it FEELS like there is a small lag for the IS to start, I don't think I've had any photos messed up because of it.You can HEAR the IS.  A little bizarre after using point and shoots that have IS that is silent, but it doesn't seem to affect performancePro:  Great price for an image stabilized zoom lens.  I paid 299 and am very pleased even though Amazon is selling it for 280 a week later.  ALso arrive 2 months sooner than Amazon initially promised.  This lens has NEVER been 400 dollars.  Its MSRP from Canon prior to release was 299.00.  Shame Amazon!Pro: Images are very sharp.Pro: Image stabilization does a VERY nice job.  Four stops as advertised by Canon?  I'm not so sure.  GREATLY enhancing the composition experience at 250mm?  Absolutely.Pro:  Much smaller and lighter than the 70-300 of any manufacturer and much sharper than my Sigma 70-300.Con:  Cheapish feel. But just use it, quit feeling it already.  Plastic mount.  But if you NEED a metal mount, may I suggest you are being a little rough with your camera.  *UPDATE* The plastic flanges on back were able to hold the camera securely to the lens, but NOT hold the rear cap securely to the lens.  I've tried many different rear lens caps that fit snugly on other lenses.  So I think this is beyond cheap feel and has to be called CHEAP BUILD.Con:  This lens is a little (ok, maybe not so little) slow to focus in dim light, sometimes it misses altogether when I think other lenses of mine would have had no difficulty.Con:  I never gave Inner Focusing much thought on my other lenses until I used this.  The front of this lens rotates AND moves in and out a LOT while focusing, so much so that you MAY even want to recompose your shot.  The length of this lens changes almost an inch across the focus range.  I just checked my Sigma 70-300 and found that it does also, but I've never seen it make as much difference in the viewfinder as I have with this Canon.  Your perception may vary.This lens and the soon to be arriving 18-55 IS as the XSi kit lens will allow me to carry one less lens to achieve an 18-250 IS range.  For a little more money than the cost of both lenses you can get the Tamrom 18-250 but not have Image Stabilization.  And now Sigma has an 18-200 WITH Optical Stablization for about what these 2 lenses cost retail, but in testing the 2 Canons produced better images.Conclusion:  A great EF-S lens for Canon users. (even if Nikon had to force Canon to make it for us.)""

Any way this is a great lens, I like that there is no mm gap between the 18-55mm lens and this lens. Also this lens includes a new feature, that is image stabilizer (can be turned on or off). This feature is good for telephoto lens because when taking a picture from far away any little movement of the camera causes the picture to be blurry, the stabilizer gets rid of that.A+++ in my book!""

I am pleased with it so far.I no longer do professional assignments, so I have not blown up my photos to see if there is any problems with the lens which would affect prints larger than 8x10. I am happy with the results so far, and pleased that the lens is shorter than lighter than I expected. I gave away a whole set of slr film cameras, with varios lenses, macro attachments, and strobes, because I now have breathing problems, which limits me in the weight of equipment carried.Reminiscence:  In the late 1950's I sold cameras, and had a hard time convincing people that the Japanese cameras were as good as, or better than, German cameras.  I had a 300mm 2.8 Minolta lens with auto diaphram, which was heavier than my Minolta SLR, which I sold because I thought the weight would end up bending the lens attachment plate.  Lenses were much faster then, most of mine were f2.0 or faster because most film was very slow, especially Kodachrome.

On a recent trip, I noticed that this lens lacked the ability to go close enough for my liking and so then I researched different lenses and finally decided on this one.The best thing about this lens is it's ease of use - I zoom in on what I want to take a picture of, click and it produces stunning pictures. I recently used it at a soccer game to grab some of the action. The photos came out amazingly and I was very pleased.

Although, supposedly advanced features of the 18-200 aren't there, the added zoom takes care of any and all problems.""

"20120113","5.0","Great lens - easy to use","Love this lens.  I am not a professional photographer so I can't rate it based upon that.  But for my use it is just wonderful.  I have very shaky hands but the pictures still come out crisp.  I have used the telephoto and it works well.  I still have yet to use it on a tripod, but even fully zoomed out (and my shaky hands), the pictures are great!""
"20120113","5.0","Awesome Lens!!!!","I got this lens to use for daytime photography and astrophotography and it performs outstanding for both. I highly recommend it. The auto focus works fast even at 250mm. Picture quality is great and the price is great also.""
"20120113","5.0","Works like a champ","What can I say? It's a good lens... attaches easily to the camera body, clicks in place smoothly and releases easily. Of course as with *any* zoom lens, you have to compensate for the reduction in light when using manual settings but that's standard stuff. I also bought a UV filter to screw onto the front of it to protect the lens front from dust, scratches and fingerprints. Came new in box but all the manuals were in Japanese. (Not that I really needed a manual but I thought it was funny)""

"20120113","3.0","IS disapointment","I purchased this to try the Image Stabilization feature as both my canon cameras are heavy, especially my 50D.  I was expecting a lot more.  I could see no difference in photos taken with this or with my other lenses. I expected the photo to be sharper...not so. At least the price was right.""

"20120104","5.0","Great photos at any distance","This lens does a good job in both indoor and outdoor conditions.  I've used it at the dog park, and the resolution at any distance is superb.  It focuses quickly and accurately.""
"20120104","3.0","Not that Great.","I bought one only because I heard it was great. I was not to impressed with it. I have an older Canon 75-300mm Non-USM and it performs the same if not better. I took several test pictures(At the same zoom) and I honestly couldn't tell what lens was used.The Auto-focus is not that great. I found myself using MF to get the picture's in better focus.For the price, I would just pick something else. I ended up selling it a couple days after I bought it.""
"20120104","5.0","satisfied","Very nice lense and the delivery arrived on time as promised. It is perfect while taking landscape photos and gave me a zoom that can go up to 400mm. the 4-5.6 aperture opened to me another new experience in photography.""

"20111230","5.0","Great for a beginner.","I am a beginner at digital photography and i think this is an excellent introductory lens, It picks up where the 18-55mm leaves off. Great for getting close-up shots without being right on top of your subject. I got this on lens through the gold box deal for 149, which is an the best price around. I would recommend this to any beginner looking for a quality telephoto lens without breaking the bank.""
"20111230","5.0","Very good lens.the image stabilization helped us take amazing pictures with the lens","This lens was totally worth the money. We used it on our trip to cancun mexico. We tried buying it from other places during thanksgiving. But only Amazon offerd this lens for $100 cheaper than all the places we looked. The image stabilization on the camera lets you take amazing pictures at high resolution and zoom. We used it with our Canon rebel SLR. We already had a 20-55mm lens and needed another lens with more zoom. Overall totally worth the money.The only down side was we had to keep changing lens everytime we switched from taking pictures of far off objects to near-by object. But that is because we had two different lenses.""
"20111230","5.0","Awesome lens, awesome price","I have been looking for this lens for quite some time and although i wasn't able to get it for $100 when i bought my T2i, this deal was a great buy, very satisfied it came in time for christmas.""
"20111230","5.0","Good lens for the price","Bought this lens when it was on the deal of the day.  I had been looking at this lens for the past fews months and waiting for it to drop in price.  I'm a newbie with the Canon Rebel T3 and this is a perfect zoom lens for me.  Easy to use and it takes nice quality photos.  It's a good zoom lens for a beginner with a D-SLR like myself.""

"20111227","5.0","Surprised by the image quality!","I bought this lens bundled with the Canon 60D when it was on sale by Amazon.com last month. It was such a great deal that I almost got this lens for free!. It is mostly made by plastic, even the lens mount. But the built quality is quite good. I had to admit that I didn't think it was a good lens based on it's total plastic material. I was considering to sell it and get a Canon 70-200mm f4 L non IS. Well, since I already got it so I decided to give it a try. I was  quite surprised to find out the image quality of this lens is wonderfully sharp! On top of that, the IS really works fantastic. I tested the lens indoor and I can handheld the lens in 250mm at 1/15 sec and the images still sharp! It totally changed my mind. I don't think I want a telephoto lens without the IS build in anymore. I'm not saying that this lens out perform the 70-200mm f4 L. But I really like the IS system and with the L series with the build in IS, it is just too much for me at this time. I think I will be very happy with this lens for now.For those who's wondering about the image quality of this lens, don't be fool by it's cheap price. Get it and you won't be disappointed. I think the reason why Canon keeps this price so low is because NIkon has a similar zoom lens and sells at a same price range. Competition is possibly the answer.""
"20111227","5.0","Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS II","I purchased this from Amazon when it was on sale. They sent me the second generation model Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS II. I didn't expect to get the newest model, so I'm definitely not complaining. Great lens for the price! Quick shipping time and excellent customer service!""
"20111227","5.0","A good zoom lens","I have had the kit lens (18-55) for a while, and felt the need for a not-too-expensive zoom lens (200 mm or more). This lens fits the bill. For the price, it's a reasonably fast lens, good picture quality. It doesn't take too much time to focus, contrary to what some of the other reviewers have claimed. My experience has been (and this may sound weird): if you are seeing through the viewfinder, then the lens focuses pretty fast. If you are composing the shot looking at the screen (the point-and-shoot way), then it takes time to focus. I have noticed this for my 18-55 lens as well.Again, I am not a professional photographer. I need a zoom lens only occasionally. This lens is perfect for me.""

"20111221","4.0",""Upgraded" from 75-300.","Bought this during the Amazon lightning deals at a great price (really only reason I bought it) to replace our 75-300 that we got free with our camera.  I will say, that just after a couple sporting events, it is already much better than the 75-300 and the image stabilization does help. We ran through the first couple set of indoor basketball and soccer pictures and they turned out much better than the 75-300. We tended to produce images that had a haze with the 75-300 and have not seen that same issue on this lens.Until we can afford an L series, we are very happy with this purchase and would recommend for someone starting in photography or are just looking to take pics of their kids events.""
"20111220","5.0","Great Lens","I bought this lens in addition to the 18-55mm that comes with the camera. Really great purchase. The lens quality is amazing and really zooms in on far away objects. Very happy.""
"20111219","4.0","For the price...","this is a very good lens. Could be of stronger construction and could auto focus a little faster, but considering the quality of the photos it takes and the price, you can't go wrong with this lens.""
"20111218","4.0","Nice Lens","This was the second lens for my t2i. I bought this in bundle along with the lens body and kit lens. I liked the lens a lot. It takes good quality photos.""
"20111218","3.0","i got it for free, but wouldnt buy it","so i basically got it for free due to a special on amazon. it works, it does what it says it will, however it is a lower end lens.  this should never be your only lens, so if your buying a camera without a lens, and your looking for one to go with it, this is not the one for you, in general do not get a telephoto lens for your only lens.  focusing with this thing takes a bit to long for my taste, and shooting video with it is almost pointless.  basically if you shoot videos with it, you will always have to be about 20 feet back due to the poor focus.  however it does work great for b footage.  auto focus sucks, you almost always have to use manual which is fine with me, however it seems a bit touchy at time.get it cheap, or get it for free like i did. basically i tried to resell it, and it didnt work out for me, so that should tell you something.""
"20111217","4.0","Very good lens for such a low price...","Bought this lens at $150. I also have Canon 17-55. The build quality is very good. The overall image quality is not as good as 17-55 but not far behind. I read a lot of reviews before buying so its image quality is within my expectation. The only drawback is the focus performance under low light. It's way behind 17-55 and sometimes cannot achieve focus at all. Under good light condition its focus speed and accuracy is pretty good.""
"20111217","3.0","Lightweight, inexpensive, good only under the right conditions","I'll say right now that this lens was an impuse buy.  It was the Amazon Deal of the Day for $144.00, so I thought I'd take a chance on it. Well, you get what you pay for.The best thing about this lens is that it's lightweight.  I have it attached to a Canon T2i and can carry it around my neck or shoulder all day and not get tired.  But it's a slow lens.  You need to be shooting in bright sunlight if you want to get a crisp shot at ISO 200 or less.  As a rule I try not to shoot above ISO 400 because of grain and, when set to auto, the 55-250mm will generally set ISO to either 800 or 1600, sometimes 3200 when zoomed in...even during the day.That said, if your lighting is bright enough to shoot at, say, 1/500th @ f/8.0, you will get photos that are crisp and clear, even when zoomed in to full 250mm.  Autofocus perfomed well for the most part, as did image stabilization.  The 55mm setting is good for portraits, if you're on auto mode.  Don't try to use this lens to capture action or for macro shots; it performed miserably in both cases.Best scenarios for this lens:1.  You're out on a sunny day and you want to capture a shot of something very far away.2.  Your shooting for the company website or Facebook page and can optimize the picture afterward.3.  You need a lens that's easy to carry around all day.I do not agree with the other reviews that tout this as a walkaround lens; for that I would recommend the Canon 28-135mm instead.  More expensive, sure, but less then $100 more.  Worth saving up for if you can only buy one additional lens and want something that performs well in moderate as well as full lighting.""
