So I am completely satisfied with the quality of this inexpensive camera.I bought it 'used' from Amazon so I won't complain that areas of the LCD are failing. The only negative comment I would make is that it is slow. From the time I press the button 3 seconds elapse before the picture is taken then the camera is exhausted and takes 5 seconds to recover.

"20120122","5.0","Use only NiMH rechargeable batteries","I like this camera very much. It is my first digital camera. It was sent to me as a gift, purchased at Amazon.Because of its lackluster customer reviews, I probably wouldn't have selected this camera myself, and would have missed out.The features I've found most useful:Very good user manual. Because this was my first digital camera, I studied it for several hours. There are many settings options. I found that they became intuitive surprisingly quickly, and they're organized into a menu structure that also became intuitive with a surprisingly short amount of practice.It uses standard rechargeable NiMH AA batteries, not a proprietary battery pack.Tripod mount. I use a tripod whenever possible, and am getting amazingly sharp crisp pictures with very good color.Large bright LCD display with intuitive readable layout that can be set to show all the important settings currently in effect while composing a shot.The flash is very bright and is wide-field, so I've had no problems with insufficient coverage of the area in a shot.Configurable sounds.The Programmed exposure mode (P) works well for most conditions. (I was less satisfied with the completely automatic AUTO (A) exposure mode.)Macro focus works well.There is a Manual (M) override for the exposure settings, which I've found interesting and useful.The center-weighted light metering mode is very good.Auto-Focus works very well. I have its mode set to Wide.Depth of field is surprisingly good under all conditions so far, even though the camera's aperture range seems quite narrow compared to SLR film cameras. Maybe that's normal for digital cameras.Using only the internal memory (no separate memory card) and with JPEG compression set to Normal, I'm getting about 28 photos at 3 megapixel size before memory is full. It says it holds about 9 12-megapixel photos, or 118 640x480 photos, but I haven't tested those settings.Battery 'problems'The camera came with two Duracell Ultra alkaline batteries dated 2016, 4 years in the future. I put them in the camera, turned it on, set the date and time, pressed OK, and that's as far as I got. The camera turned itself off because it thought the batteries were exhausted.It appears to me that you simply cannot use alkaline batteries in this camera (in spite of their being provided in the package), even if you set the battery mode to Alkaline. They cannot deliver the current surges required by this (or probably any) digital camera.For a couple of days, I used some Energizer NiMH AA's that I had, but only got about 9 flash photos per charge because they were old.With new Duracell 2450 mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries, I've got at least 100 photos so far (most of them with flash) on a single charge and haven't exhausted the batteries yet.Moral of the story: if you don't have high capacity NiMH rechargeable AA batteries and a charger, get those items at the same time that you purchase this camera. You'll need them.I thought I should mention that because some of the customer review complaints have been about an apparently dead camera, and I have to wonder if the batteries might have been the real problem, considering that the only thing I was able to accomplish with the provided batteries was set the date and time.When I searched Amazon to see what other camera I might have chosen for myself instead of this one, I couldn't find anything I would be confident about liking better than this one, especially at anywhere near the price of this one.""

I cannot believe it is that difficult to switch from picture mode to video mode.  Am I the only one who wants to take a video with this camera?So far the point-and-shoot is a little slow compared to other Canon cameras I have owned.  And for the record, Canon cameras have a dial on the top, so you just click over from camera to video.  Some even have a dedicated video button, so there is no switching at all.Polaroid customer service told me (after 30 minutes on hold) that no one had ever given negative feedback on the difficulty of getting to video mode.  Personally I find that hard to believe.Overall I would give the camera three stars, but for the difficulty of doing video, I think two stars is generous.  Video is a major feature for me.""

I think the mechanism that slides the lens forward is stuck because when we try to turn it on, the display lights up, the camera makes a few honking sounds, and then it shuts down.

I mentioned this because after reading the reviews here I was a little hesitant but the price was too good to resist and decided that it was worth the risk. In the end I figured if the camera didn't work then I would at least still have a nice little photo printer.I would like to address that I didn't have the lens problem that other reviewers had mentioned of. That's not to say that the problem does not or couldn't exist. To be on the safe side I registered my products right away with polaroid.And after browsing through the manual I am pleased to find out that there is options to shoot video as well as take pictures in hd quality. 16:9 aspect ratio to be more specific. I have not tried it but it's nice to know that it's there. I can however say that the settings and adjustments are there for anyone who is willing to take the time to go through the manual to get a handle on the features. And yes they do make a difference as I noticed just by taking three of the same pictures in my room but under different settings.In all I would say that this camera has enough features to rival if not beat the other mass marketed digital cameras that you would find at costco, walmart, target etc. Don't be discouraged by the so called lens problem that the other reviewers have stated had happened. To counter this just make sure that you are getting a sufficient warranty wherever you purchase it from.""

We did not encounter any issues related to the battery and the pictures came out OK for a point and shoot. Fast forward two months (the camera had been placed back in the box and rested on a shelf.  We were packing to go to a family function and my daughter excitedly grabbed her camera, turned it on to test the batteries and it would not turn on.  No problem, we have new batteries.  With brand new batteries the camera will no initialize.  The initial power on results in the lens cover opening briefly and then three beeps and it shuts off.  I think there may be an issue with the gears for the lens assembly binding up.  It is still under warranty so, I will look for a repair center however, I do not believe there is one in driving range.

When I needed it, it was not available, so I called Polaroid.  Of course they wouldn't admit fault, but this is a bad model number.  So I returned my second one.In the end, after all this time had passed, the best value on the market (excluding this crappy camera) was a Kodak EasyShare C183 Black 14MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom for $59 at Walmart Online.  I went for it.  Not only does the 14MP camera work better, it has more features and is many, many times better overall.Bottom Line:Don't waste your time.  There were clearly some issues in production of this thing, because it is a magnificent camera aside from a very necessary element.  Avoid it at all costs.""

"20110120","1.0","disappointed","I ordered two cameras as Christmas gifts.  Neither camera works.  Nice, huh?  Too much hassle to send back b/c they were opened.  How do you know they will work if you don't open the boxes?""
"20110118","4.0","My 1st reaction was - Do NOT buy!!!","Please, read both parts of my review.Part 1The camera takes nice pictures, has got nice settings... if you manage to turn it on.When it arrived I started to test it. I've made 9-10 shots and turned it off to remove SDHC card. Moved pics to computer, quality was decent, then I put card back in the camera and pushed power button. No response! At all! It's dead!!!Do NOT buy this junk!!!Part 2. The next day experience.I'm really confused. The next day I've decided to try my luck and pushed power button and the camera turned on. Since then it works just fine. I tried to reproduce the problem and here are my observation: Do not push ANY (I mean ANY) button while it is connected to the PC via USB cable. It went dead every time I did so. Actually 3 times, then I stopped to tempt my luck.Other than that it works just nice and smoothly. No problem with turning it on/off. The picture quality is great, it's easy to operate and has got many, many settings to play with.Overall, excellent family camera, especially considering the price.Would I recommend it to anyone? Hmmmm, I guess so. But taking other reviews into consideration, it seems like some kind of gamble, though.p.s. Changing rating from 1 star to 4 stars.UPDATE: After 6 months of heavy abuse from 12 years old kid the camera still works fine.""
"20110117","1.0","terrible and very dissapointing, im disgusted at polaroid, shame on you","i cant believe this piece of crap, i thought it would be of excellent quality because of the name brand polaroid. they need to take this camera off the market. when i opened the box the package was cut through the middle in an angle. the camera was not damaged so i decided to open it and possibly keep it. yeah right. i think the camera came on the first day, my son tell me lol. im so upset i dont even remember, then i shut the camera off cause we had to leave the house for a while. the next few days i decided to check the camera out some more and the stupid dum camera came on then shut off while i was taking pictures, lol. i tried cutting it back on, it did not come on, i pressed the button over and over again continuously, it still did not come on. so i gave the dam thing a break, it still didnt come on, im like what the hell is going on, this is a new name brand camera, why the power button shuts off while youre taking a few pictures? why does the lens in the front of the camera get stuck when the camera shuts off. so basically, the lens is just sticking out, when it should go back in when the camera shuts off. the lens also go in on its on without u doing it yourself.  why does it come back on in like a half hour or more hours, when it shouldnt go off in the first place, and it should come on anytime u want it on. the battery was also full, this is the batteries that came with the camera,  duracell ultra. lol this camera is a scam and do no not waist your money on this crap, im happy i did not have this crap when the lunar eclipse happened, you cant depend on this camera, it would have dissapointed me on the lunar eclipse day.  this was not my first choice of cameras, i ordered another camera before this,  a purple fuji, but the camera looked used and was missing a usb cord, so i sent it back and got refunded, and used my refund money to purchase this crappy polaroid camera. i am happy that other people made comments about polaroid errors, when i read your comments i was laughing because i couldnt believe i wasnt the only one experiencing this. the same problems other people have with this camera i am going through this now. i am sending this boot leg piece of polaroid crap back and want all my money back lol. shame on u polaroid. i should have got a cheap unknown digital camera, and i just might do that lol. so no more polaroid no more fuji. dam scam.""
"20110114","1.0","DOA","This camera despite being well packaged and boxed was dead when my daughter opened it up for Christmas.  She was so dissapointed as was I when Amazon could do nothing but refund the lighting deal price I paid.  So I wind up spending twice as much for a replacement camera.""
"20110108","5.0","Great Camera! Great Price!","I bought this camera for my daughter and she LOVES it! Great pictures and I get more pictures of my grand daughter! Great camera, great price!""
"20110108","4.0","Basic Digital Camera, worth the price","This camera can be a nice, inexpensive option for the casual user. I had read the reviews posted prior to purchase and wanted a backup to my two smartphone cameras (IPhone and IPod) for use when traveling. I installed the batteries with the camera and began taking some test shots. No sooner than my 4th or 5th shot, the camera stopped working. After replacing the batteries and installing an SD card, I tried again and the camera worked perfectly. Clearly, any buyer should begin use with a memory card (of any capacity) to allow for adequate storage and with fresh batteries.The test pictures were printed using your basic (CVS) service and even with enlargement, I was moderately impressed with the quality of the print.So the two steps a new user should follow are:  1. replace the batteries included with the camera with fresh high capacity batteries and  2. use a memory card immediately before use.""
"20110106","1.0","I HATE THIS CAMERA","Honestly, just save your money. Even the packaging suggests this camera should be $19.99. I wish I would've just spent the extra 20 dollars and got a real camera. Camera sucks, flash sucks, and the software is primitive. Turns on fine, does everything fine. It's just a piece of trash. SAVE YOUR MONEY.""
"20110104","1.0","Disappointing","I bought it for myself with a gift certificate (12-25-2010). I was excited about this camera, for the features it was a good deal for the price. Worked for one day, took a few pics then would shut off when trying to take a picture and then never came on again. Had to return, was very disappointed because I really liked the camera, color and all.  Should not be sold until problems are fixed.""
"20110103","2.0","Great pictures, but not reliable","After reading mixed reviews, we chose to order this camera due to the low price and seemingly comparable quality to other 12mp cameras.  After receiving it very promptly, it worked well for the first 2 days, as others mentioned and then decided to suddenly turn off with the lens stuck out.  We tried changing the batteries and pushing the power button several times, but nothing worked.  We set it down and hours later, the lens had retracted and it worked again.  I told my daughter if it happened again we would return it.  Within 12 hours it did exactly the same thing with the lens again stuck in an out position and no buttons would work. All of this is very sad because the picture quality is excellent.  We were at my brother-in-law's wedding and lost a lot of shots because of the lack of dependability.Hopefully Polaroid will address this issue, because if it weren't for the camera shutting down, I would highly recommend it!  It isn't happening to everyone who buys it, since some of the reviews don't mention it, but enough that it is cause for concern...Regarding the return, it was very simple and Amazon is paying the return shipping.  I highly recommend ordering through Amazon!""
"20101227","1.0","Junk!","I bought this for my mother as a Christmas present after CAREFULLY looking at the reviews.  I see a bunch of new ones now with the same issue I ran into.  I was showing her how to use it and it would not turn back on.  I could not imagine what I was doing wrong, for goodness sake it was a digital camera - something I have been using since introduction into mainstream.  After I handed it off to someone else and they could not turn it on, I boxed it back up and completed a RMA and dropped it off this morning at the Post Office.  I felt the brand would have produced a better quality item.  It felt cheap and loose, terrible SD card locking mechanism and counter intuitive menu.  This is an over priced child's disposable camera.  I am totally disgusted that Polaroid would put their name on this POS.  DO NOT BUY!""
"20101225","2.0","Same problem as other reviewers!","I agree that this camera takes good pictures and I was really happy with it for about 3 days. Now I am having the same issue with not being able to turn it on. It will work every once in a while at random, but for the most part, it doesn't even come on with brand new batteries in it. If it does, it shuts off in the process of taking a picture and now mine also is stuck with the lens out. Not sure how to get it back in, but I guess if I can't I will be returning it that way.""
"20101223","2.0",":(  Takes nice pictures when it decides to work!!!","I had high hopes for this camera when it arrived today, unfortunately for me the one that I ordered is crazy! The first few times I pressed the power button it would not turn on. After finally getting it to come on I tried taking pictures with it, during the first shot the camera cut off and I couldnt get it to come back on. The camera comes with 2AA duracell ultra batteries and the display showed that it was full when I got it to come back on. I wished I hadnt desired to save money since at the time there was another camera on sale for about twenty more bucks. I had found another of these when searching similar items that is about the same price but after checking targets(the seller) website for reviews I found one in which a reviewer had the exact same problem I am having and theirs ended up with the lens stuck out and useless after only one week, until I read that I had considered giving this one until my birthday at the beginning of the year to act right before returning it. I still may try the one from the different seller since maybe its possible I happened to buy one of the defective ones, fingers crossed because I have the pogo and thought another poloroid product would be the best paired with it. Finally got my 5 pics off the camera and I must say it does take excellent pics which is why I gave 2stars Switching to record mode for the first time is a bit tedious but once you have done it once you can press the scene button which brings up a mini menu where you can choose recent settings and it will be in that menu. Still sad I have to send it back""
"20101221","5.0","Inexpensive quality","Although this camera has a few quirks, after a brief introductory period and the purchase of an SD card, my wife loves it.Why I bought it: This camera was a gift for my wife who has a very nice camera (a Sony about a half-step below a professional camera) which she uses most of the time.  She wanted something small that she could stick in her pocket for those spur of the moment occasions that crop up at children's school parties and such.  This camera fits the bill.It easily fits into her pocket (either shirt or jeans), takes high quality photos, has numerous optional settings, and with an 8 GB SD card has room for over 2000 photos at the highest quality settings.  It takes AA batteries, so there is no 'I forgot to charge the camera' issues.Quirks:1) The first quirk is the way the camera reacts when its memory is full.  This is simple to do if you don't buy an SD card immediately.  The camera defaults to the highest MP setting (12) which allows about four or five photos on the camera memory.  Then the camera displays a message saying that the memory is full.  Ours also seemed to have a hiccup the first time it happened and we had to turn it off and turn it back on using the play button on the back of the camera.  After this, the camera was fine.2) The batteries.  This camera uses AAs.  I have heard arguments against this, but my wife and I prefer this feature.  Our reasoning is simple: if the batteries run out, almost every store on the planet carries AAs.  We can walk into any of them and buy more.  You can't say the same if you forget or use all of a proprietary battery that is unique to a specific camera.  For the eco-conscious, you can still use rechargeable batteries, they are just going to be rechargeable AAs.3) Snap-time.  I don't even know if that's a term, but it describes the issue fairly well.  This camera takes a while to capture the photo.  While this is a bit annoying, the wait seems in line with most of our friends' and families' cameras.  I have only witnessed one camera not have this issue and I know for a fact that one cost over $3,000 (i.e. a bit out of our budget.)NOTE: There may be a setting that changes this that we have not found yet.Overall: we have had a very good experience so far with the camera.  We are extremely hopeful that this will continue.""
"20101219","5.0","Very Professional Features!","It was unexpected when I started using the camera to find that it has many professional features. Unexpected because it's call a 'Point and Shoot'. But the list of features includes everything for fully automatic, to being able to adjust every photograph setting. I'll use the automatic setting for now, but being able to adjust things as needed will be useful.""
"20101211","5.0","Nice for the money. Sharp pictures.","The pictures from this camera are very sharp and for the money can't be beat. This camera comes with software cd, 2 duracell ultra AA batteries, and usb cable. All that is needed is an SD card for picture storage. Night pictures with flash and anti-shake look very clear and detailed. Can't say enough about this camera's features along with Amazon's price of roughly $50.""
"20101208","1.0","Avoid","Bought for my five year old. She loved it, for the twelve hours it almost worked. Right away, turning it on required a repeated press of the on button until it would randomly cooperate. Then, after 12 hours, every time we turned it on, it said 'Goodbye' and turned itself off, despite fresh batteries and memory card. Her toy cameras worked better than this piece of junk.""
"20101207","5.0","Good price!","I just picked this up as a gift - the price is irresistible! About batteries v. chargers - I have found that batteries tend to last a LONG time in a camera, so I have no problem with the lack of a charter. In fact, I have come to prefer batteries over chargers where cameras are concerned.BTW, a review is not the place to set out concerns like that.""
