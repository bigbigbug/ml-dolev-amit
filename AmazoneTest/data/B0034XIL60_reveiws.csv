"20120522","5.0","Perfect Camera for my Purse!","Two years ago, I was looking for a camera that would be easy to keep in my purse for those 'Oh, I wish I had a camera!' moments. Knowing that Nikon makes very good cameras, I stumbled upon this one. It has been absolutely wonderful!! It takes wonderful pictures! I had an entire 32-ounce water bottle leak in my purse (the camera was very wet) and I've dropped my camera, but it still works! Well, the battery and card door broke when I dropped it and taping it worked for almost a year. Now the 'tape-fix' suddenly stopped working, but all I have to do is hold the door closed when I snap a picture. I'm sure I'll buy a new camera soon as holding the door has gotten a bit annoying. However, I am still shocked that the camera has worked through both major incidents! If I do buy a new camera, I will be buying the exact same one (and making sure I don't drop it or have water near it!) because I LOVE this camera!!!I have taken scenic pictures, pictures in extreme conditions (like snow), pictures up close of myself and others (holding the camera out), and everything in between, and it takes fabulous pictures of everything! I have also used it to take a number of videos and they turn out really good as well!! This is a great little camera!""

Now, the zoom feature in the second camera has also stopped working.Because it takes great pics, is fast, light and easy to use, I gave it two stars, otherwise I would have given it one.At the end of the day it seems something is defective with the zoom feature - so beware.""

The person working the electronics counter highly recommended the Nikon.  I needed a camera that day so went with his recommendation, but I have to say, all the negative reviews are totally true.  Blurry pictures (especially if you try to zoom).  Why have a zoom option if it won't take a clear picture?  I also had the same problem with the battery door.  The little plastic piece that is to hold the door shut broke off so now the only way to use the camera is by holding the door shut.

"20120424","2.0","do not buy; too many problems","I bought this camera in June of 2010 and for the first year it was pretty good: you can carry it in your pocket, it takes great daytime photos; on the other hand, without good lighting you get either blurry photos(using natural light) or an overexposed look when you use the flash.  I still could have lived with all that given the price and the convenience.  However, the battery door started malfunctioning after about a year and wouldn't stay shut (I had to tape it).  Then, the zoom stopped working and the pictures were out of focus a lot of the time.  Finally, on a recent trip to Europe it kept totally shutting down and giving me the message 'lens error.'  Extremely frustating to the point thatI will avoid Nikon altogether from now on.""
"20120423","1.0","Disappointing","I purchased this camera as a replacement for a Canon Sure Shot that died after years of giving me excellent service as an inexpensive easy to use camera that took quality photos and videos. I wanted to replace it with another inexpensive point and shoot camera of equal quality and the one I was replacing was no longer made. I saw this Nikon L22 for very good price and trusting the Nikon name purchased it. It has been a big disappointment. My Canon had a sports mode that I used to reduce blur and I could take pictures without flash in very low light and still get bright pictures with correct colors. The Nikon not only has a sports mode but also image stabilization but I can use them together and get a blurred image of an inanimate object. The only way I can get pictures that are not blurry is to use the auto mode with auto flash. But then the flash fires in any setting other than bright sunlight and I end up with pictures that are washed out and colors that are not even close to being correct. They say you get what you pay for but if Canon could make a good inexpensive camera why can't Nikon? The canon also had an instruction book and the controls were so simple it took no time at all to learn to use it. The Nikon comes with a CD only so you have to learn to use it before leaving home and the controls are complicated and buried in layers of screens accessed through the menu button. Want to take a macro shot of a prized flower in your garden? That setting is a sub-setting under sports. Yeah, that's intuitive. If you want a good point and shoot that is inexpensive, look at a camera other than this one.""

( The camera, somehow, is able to tell where the faces of people are )""
"20110618","5.0","Great especially if you're new to digital cameras!","Before I begin, note Amazon comment that there is an update of this camera, the Nikon 'L-24' while this review deals with the almost identical L-22 model but I note the 'updated' L-24 offers 14.0 megapixels while the L-22 offers 12.0 megapixels. Since my overall savvy of photography AND cameras consists of two words, viz., 'point and shoot', I'm hardly the one to comment on megapixels or anything else camera feature wise since the L-22 under review was/is my first 'digital' camera. Here's the story in brief: I kept noticing folks with 'digital' cameras and I commented after watching one long term friend shoot pic after pic in succession, 'how many pictures can you take with that thing?' and he responds that with his 'memory' insert, he can take 'hundreds' [!] of pics! Needless to say, I was still using those instant flash cameras with the 26 pics and then you get the film developed routine but I decided to take the plunge into 'digital' cameras especially since our grown children introduced us to Facebook and this business of taking pics and then [if one wanted to] immediately transferring those pics [via the supplied USB cable that comes wsith the digital camera] into the computer picture gallery and then on to Facebook! I was so fascinated by the process and which admittedly has been around for some years but, hey, you know the old story, you tend to keep with the familiar and 'digital' cameras 'do' have the proverbial learning curve until you know what you're doing! Anyway, I went a further step and bought one of those photo digital copiers [the Epson V30 which I got on sale and free shipping at Amazon] and then I could put family pics on Facebook [not to mention digitally 'preserving' them from the ravages of time!] and old classic pics and even [with the V30] take some of the time caused smudge marks out of the pics and even enhance the color of older color photos!Anyway, this is an excellent starter 'digital' camera and I'm well pleased with it. I'll even share this with you -- at the recent 2011 Memorial Day parade, I don't know how many times and out of pure habit I went to bring the new digital camera up to my eye and then it dawns on me that the 3' viewer is where you frame the pic and there is no 'old time' single eye-view gizmo but it gets better -- I take a bunch of parade pics using the 3' screen viewer but did I even remember [equally out of habit] that the digital camera even 'had' a 3.6X 'zoom' lens? Noooooooo! But get this and my point here, while later on reviewing the pics in the camera 3' viewer, my index finger 'accidentally' touched against the zoom lever and the 'standard' pic I'm looking at [and as I originally took the pic] suddenly increased in size! In effect, one can zoom the picture AFTER it's already been taken AND there appeared an icon of a scissors asking me whether I wanted to save the now 'edited' picture [while preserving the original 'as taken' pic] and when I clicked 'yes', the 'edited' [read: now zoomed] pic was duly saved in memory! Then I 'discover' that the zoom can be further increased AND the pic can even be 'panned' so that it can be centered or even certain objects taken out! This was news to me! Yeah, I know, and I can hear you from here, to wit, 'Hey, Doc! When all else fails, read the manual!' ;-)Couple of things. Don't misplace that USB cable because while the end which goes into the computer is the standard size USB plug, the 'camera' end of the USB cable looks like what I'd term a sort of 'sub-sub-mini' plug. It's a 'very' tiny plug that goes into the camera. Without that USB cable, you can't do pic transfers into the computer unless, of course, you want to go the flash memory transfer route [putting the camera memory chip itself into the computer] ==but== you can only do that if your computer 'has' a flash memory reader! Keep the supplied USB cable in a safe place! You might also want to buy a protective holder for the camera because it does 'not' come with one and hey, it's still almost a C-Note to buy so you'll want to protect it, especially the 3' viewing screen from scratches. Finally this, there is a quick read manual that comes with it and the full and lengthy 'explain all' manual is on a CD. The other CD is the Nikon software ==but==  if you have Windows 7 [dunno about Vista or Windows XP], you can use Windows 7 itself to set the thing up if all you want to do is transfer pics into your Windows picture gallery and/or do some minor tinkering with the pic using Windows. I let Windows 7 automatically set it up and it will do that the moment you plug in the USB cable coming from the camera unless you opt to do the Nikon software thing. For my needs and purposes, Windows 7 setting it up in seconds was just fine. If you pay attention to the 'in hand' Nikon 'quick start' guide, you should be fine. The camera will also take short duration movies at 30 FPS! The 'trash can' icon will dump any pics or short movies you're not pleased with or don't want to keep. Focusing is automatic and the camera has a standard size screw-in gizmo at the bottom to place the camera on a tripod. The flash is built-in and the camera 'sensor' decides [although you can over-ride that where 'you' decide when to use a flash assist] when it's needed and when it's not needed. It also takes out the old 'red eye' thing [with flash] but how it does this escapes me. All I know is that it works! As I said, for a beginner digital camera, I'm well pleased with it and even if you're a pro, it's light weight, reliable [thus far!] and fits in the palm of your hand or T-shirt pocket. Various camera colors are available too. Comes with a tie-on nylon holding cord but 'not' with a camera protective cover. Ironically, the updated L-24 Nikon [with 14.0 megapixels] is presently $5 'cheaper' than the L-22. You may wish to compare the 'updated' Nikon L24 features with the L22 and make the call as to which one you buy although my understanding is that the the more megapixels the camera has, the sharper the image. I also assume that with the updated L-24, the L-22 should further drop in price.Doc Tony""
"20110617","1.0","Good carry around, but focusing problems","This camera is very light and is good for carrying around.  Under perfect conditions, it takes very good pictures.  Features are fine.  However, the auto-focus does not work very well on Zoom and virtually never in low light conditions.  I have other cameras in this genre, and they don't seem to have the same problem, so it can't be a price point issue.  Other people seem to have problems with the auto-focus as well - do a search on Nikon Coolpix Focus Problem and you'll see what I mean.  No one seems to have an answer to the problem.  'Use a tripod' seems to be the most common response.  That is silly and I can't tell you how many times I've been frustrated with this camera.My way around this is that I take a picture at regular zoom and then do a zoom on editing software.  Because of the 12 mexapixels, you can do this with a fairly good resolution.  Still, I shouldn't have to - that's why it has a zoom.  In anything other than bright light you need to wait several seconds while the camera beeps and tries to find the focus point.  Since this is a camera you'd be keeping in your pocket or bag, it would be used for quick, on the spot pictures.  However, it doesn't operate that way.  It focuses too slowly and seems to be thinking about whether it should use flash or not.Ultimately, I use it when I don't want to carry around a bigger camera, but if I had the option to go back, I would choose something else.-----------------------------Update: The focusing problems never went away, and ultimately, the lens no longer opens up.  It may have been a defective camera, but I've gotten nowhere with Nikon on working on this.  It's basically useless now and I've had to go out and get another camera.""

"20110506","2.0","Really not impressed","After owning this camera for 8 months, I have decided I really don't like it and will be replacing it. It works fine if you're taking pictures outside in broad daylight, but if you want to take pictures of moving objects, or indoors (even with adequate lighting), forget it. The photos turn out grainy and blurry, and most of the settings are useless. You can't tinker with any of the settings so there is not much flexibility at all. I absolutely DETEST the flash: It flashes twice, so if you're taking pictures of pets or children, they will blink on the first flash, and and on the second flash their eyes are closed. So you will very rarely ever get pictures of your critters with their eyes open. You have to take the pictures over and over again and by then your subject is blinded! What's more, is that the flash is way too bright. Pictures come out looking very washed out with the flash on, and with the flash off the pictures come out blurry. There is no happy medium. Before I bought this camera, I had a Canon Powershot, but lost it on vacation (dropped it in the ocean - oops!) I am going to buy another Canon and give this one away.""

I originally bought it with the thought of giving it to my son, but I'm keeping it for myself and handing down my old camera to him!

It has given them freedom to take as many pictures as they want and view them immediately while using the camera's features for special effects.  Since they're still children, we didn't want to spend too much money on a starter camera, but we wanted a decent camera that takes nice pictures at a good pricepoint.  So far, we have been very pleased.  As for durability, I can't honestly speak to that since we've only had the cameras for about a month (and they haven't yet been dropped), but everything is in good working order at the moment.

I paid almost 9 times more than this camera on 2004 for a Konica Minolta and with less features and quality. I bought a Sony DCS-TX5 just 2 months ago and paid 4 times more price than this one but this Nikon Coolpix camera beats Sony DSX-TX5 by picture quality wise. I just took 3-4 shot at night so far just for testing but I am impressed with the quality of picture.""

"20110428","5.0","This Nikon lives up to its name","I bought this for youngest (14) in preparation for her High School band trip. We've been inundated with photos ever since. She's not particularly technologically savvy, nor is she by any means a technophobe, which means that she's probably an average consumer. In any case, she mastered the camera's functions in about an hour. That tells me that the Nikon folks did their homework in designing the camera. Full disclosure - I've owned Nikon SLRs for more than 30 years. That said, the first 'pocket' camera I purchased was a Canon for my middle child, also in advance of a school trip. This Nikon is every bit the equal of that Canon in features and performance. Given that Canon overtook and for a time) surpassed Nikon in Digital SLR technology, I consider that high praise.""
"20110427","2.0","crap","This camera has few redeeming qualities- despite it's advertised 12 megapixels, it's useless whenever this camera struggles to stabilize for a shot. I don't have epilepsy but half of the photos I take suggests so. The photo has tragically yellow tones regardless of whether its indoors with ambient lighting or natural lighting. I have been a lifelong photograph enthusiast and this by far is the worst camera I've ever worked with - I've had better luck with point and shoot film cameras that couldn't have been more than 50 bucks. Half of your photos will be wobbly and yellow.I thought it was the cheaper version of the Nikon Coolpix S220, which I enjoyed for a low budget digital. Crap, crap, crap. don't try to save the 20 dollars.I guess if you have a stand and photoshop to make up for these crap qualities I'm sure you'd get around it, otherwise there are better cameras in its price range.Two stars because I think I've been able to take at least ten good shots within a year I've owned it so it works sometimes...?""

"20110425","5.0","A camera for on the go","This camera is wonderful for non-professional use.  I received this camera as a Christmas present and the first thing that stood out was it's size.  It is small and very portable but yet it has a big bright and clear LCD screen.  It is an easy to use camera for anyone of any age and it comes with the basic features that are standard in most cameras.  It also uses AA batteries which at first may seem like an inconvenience since I had to buy my own rechargable ones (other cameras have their own specific battery) but ended up being very beneficial because if you ever need batteries while on vacation you can easily buy some ready to go AA's at a nearby store.  I'm not sure sure how good the video quality is since I only use it for shooting photos, but the photo quality is awesome! There are many who have complained that their photos are blurry and when i first experimented with this camera they were blurry.  It wasn't until I switched it to 'auto mode' that they became as great as those other good reviews have stated.  So unless you want blurry pictures DO NOT USE 'easy auto mode'.""

The reason that the Nikon sits in the backseat is: it doesn't have all the apps that can be added to the iPod Touch, simply, even with the low resolution images, the iTouch is better suited to the documentary style of work that I do. Worth the $$$ spent, but it doesn't let me enter text, e-mail, or post on my blog. If you want a very good 'camera', GET one, Nikon Coolpix, that is . . .""

It's good for beginners who just like taking photos, and it's pretty easy to use with the autoshoot option. Once you start playing around with the different modes you do get a better quality picture, and if you click the shutter button once to focus that helps a bit with the blurriness. For about 70 bucks (how much it was at Best Buy) it's ok, next time we will put a few more bucks in for better camera.

"20110410","1.0","Poor product that dimishes the Nikon Brand","I purchased this product as a gift for a novice photographer, thinking it would be just right for someone just beginning to take photos.  And I relied on the Nikon brand name to deliver a quality product, even at the entry level. Was I ever mistaken! The camera feels as if it's make of cheap plastic and the controls feel toy-like.  The photos produced by this camera are soft and the colors slightly off.  But worst of all, the zoom control lever stopped working after 46 photos. Without a functioning zoom, the camera was useless. I have purchase several digital cameras from Amazon - from point and shoots to SLRs - and have never seen a quality problem like this one.  I returned the L22 to Amazon and declined their offer to send me another one.  I had seen enough of the Coolpix L22 -- and Nikon entry-level cameras.  I have not yet purchased a replacement for this one -- but it won't be a Nikon. And from the high number of 1-star ratings I see for this camera, many others have reached the same conclusion.""

"20110406","5.0","Great Camera","After reading most of the reviews, those good and bad, I decided to purchase this camera, and actually received it earlier than Amazon had stated.  With that said, this is a simple point and shoot camera.  I think the bad reviews (however, I'm concerned about the 'flimsy' battery door cover) were based on some folks not knowing how to 'use' the camera.  Basic camera operation, press the shutter HALFWAY, it beeps when it's focused, and then continue pressing the button all the way down.  Picture was taken immediately, no wait time like some of the reviews implied here, and the results were excellent.  Picture was in focus, colors were good, and overall for the price of the camera, it did a darn good job!  I took photos outdoors and indoors in various lightning conditions with overall excellent results.  I even used the macro mode for very up close shots.  I did find that turning the flash mode to the 'off' setting, prevented the picture from being washed out, and with the flash off the results were pretty good using ambient light for macro shots. With more use of the camera, I'll find out how great the battery life is, movie mode and some of the other advanced features. So, even though I've only used it for a day, I'm very satisfied with this camera and would suggest it to friends who are looking for a good camera with a good price.""

I find that the quality of the images are, most generally, excellent. As it does not have VR for use of the extremes in zoom mode it is limited unless I have a mono or tripod. But for times I visit a museum where they do not allow large cameras (or, as one exhibit told me, anything with a detachable lens) this L22 works quite well, capturing images in all sorts of different lighting. The available settings (flash, no flash, sports, portrait, etc) are a nice feature for an inexpensive quality unit. There is even a 'museum' setting. The 12mp image size is great. I typically use AA batteries (Duracell or Energizer) and they last for an extremely long time, probably a good 200-300 shots, maybe more. It is very easy to get used to and operate, with a nice size preview screen. Overall I am very pleased with the Coolpix L22 and would recommend it for amateurs, enthusiasts, or anyone needing to have a back-up for, as I said, times when larger gear is not allowed.""

"20110321","2.0","I Don't Recommend Getting this Camera!","I would normally check CNET or Amazon Reviews before purchasing something of this nature but didn't because I purchased this camera on a whim in Wal-Mart. I agree with all the 1 star reviews but chose to give this camera 2 stars because I was able to get some decent pictures out of it. I will never purchase a Nikon Cool Pix camera EVER again for the following reasons that I've listed below:We just got back from taking a family vacation over Spring break and this camera has given us nothing but problems.  The top of the line batteries don't last very long in this camera.  We constantly had to change out the batteries.  I was hoping to get better usage from the batteries and bought this camera thinking it would be more convenient than carrying around our lithium rechargeable battery camera.The flash on this camera is insufficient. There are times when it does not work and when it does, it whitewashes the entire picture!  I have experienced delay times when going back and forth between the different modes. Most of all of our pictures came out blurry regardless of whether or not the person was standing still.  You could be standing absolutely still and the picture will still come out blurry! There is a delay between the time you snap the picture and when your actual photo shows up on the screen.  I've also noticed that the shades in colors are also different on the LCD screen which is very frustrating.  We constantly had to retake pictures.  I've had to delete so many pictures.When using the provided USB cable to connect the camera to my laptop several issues occurred.  I kept getting error messages.  At first I thought it was my computer so I rebooted and tried again and got the same error messages.  I also tried on a desktop and encountered the same problems.  It took me forever to transfer pictures to my computer because an error message kept popping up stating, 'L22 is busy' or 'Your device is not functioning properly' and once the error appeared, the camera would lock up my system and then I would have to use the task manager to close out the program.  It also locked up my desktop computer when I tried using it on there.  When I was finally able to get it to work, I would still get the error message and if it didn't lock up my system, it would knock me out of the program and I would have to start over with the photo transfer!  I was finally able to transfer photos after struggling with it for over two hours!  That is totally unacceptable.  I haven't had a chance to read through the reviews to see if any other members experienced these same problems but having dealt with all these issues, I can honestly say that I will never ever purchase another one of these cameras again!  I recommend you don't purchase this piece of junk either.""

"20110320","1.0","A terrible camera","Firstly, the photo quality of this camera is terrible - expect most of your shots to be completely out of focus. It also has terrible light sensitivity and color balance.This is assuming that your camera works to begin with. You can also expect that transfering pictures from the camera to your computer will fail more often than not - after a few months, the camera could no longer be detected by computers, rendering it useless.I would advise that you spend a little extra money for a camera that works - otherwise, you'll find yourself spending as much, if not more, to constantly replace this piece of garbage""
"20110320","1.0","Not worth it","This camera is incredibly slow with the flash on and off and the picture quality is average at best. It would be well worth an extra $50-$100 spent to purchase a faster, smaller and more more reliable camera.""

Pictures menu is great.  It's a simple point and shoot digital.  The flash is RIDICULOUSLY bright.  Horrible.  I can NOT get a decent photo of my daughter INSIDE when I need a flash.

"20110315","2.0","Waste","I received this camera as a birthday gift and I am far from impressed. I only got a new camera b/c my other had broke so I was desperate. My parents picked it out and usually do a good job with electronics however I think my father was sucked in by the cool color. That is the only good thing about this camera.It takes forever to focus and take a picture. It is somewhat confusing to use. The full user manual is a DISC for a computer. What if you wanted to look something up but didn't have a computer nearby? COME ON! And the quick start guide looks like it'd have a lot in it, but it's too busy covering 3 languages in addition to English. Pictures taken in dim lighting that would benefit from flash, apparently don't trigger the flash. About half of pictures come out dim, yellow, grainy, out of focus or a mix of all four. I've taken to using the camera on the portrait setting just so that the flash will come on.I wanted a camera with regular batteries b/c I like to carry extra on me and I don't like dealing with a charger.  This camera also eats batteries like crazy. I can't take over 100 picts and review them without having to find new batteries. My last camera, a Cannon something or other that was like 5 years old hardly needed batteries.LASTLY, my biggest complaint about this camera is the battery door. If you touch bottom every so slightly the door will pop open throwing the batteries all over. Idk how many batteries are lost underneath stuff at my house b/c of this. Sometimes it even throws open with so much force that the memory card gets loose. So don't even bother trying to take this to the bar. With the batteries not staying in, potentially losing your memory card, and the amount of time it takes to get a picture, it's not worth the stress. I would tape the battery door closed but since the camera goes through batteries so fast it's just not worth it.Save yourself the sanity. There are plenty of other cameras out there with a comparable price.""
"20110314","3.0","Nikon CoolPix L22 not what I was expecting","I received this camera for Christmas and I have been trying to 'like' the camera ever since. I have not had a clear or good picture since I started using this camera. The functions are easy enough to use, but I really hate the delay when I am trying to get a picture. There have been several times that I thought I would capture the image but the delay when I pressed the shutter was about 3 seconds, by that time the picture moment is gone. I also do not like the quality of the pictures and there is nothing that you can do to get the flash to work every time, so most of the pictures turn out very yellow looking and if there is any movement at all, even in sports mode then the picture is very blurry.I will keep this camera because I don't want to upset the ones that gave it to me, and maybe put it in my purse in case of a photo op because it is very small, and easy to use, however for my more serious photos and memories I have purchased a Fuji FinePix s1500 because it is also easy to use and has higher quality photos for those moments that you want to see clearer and brighter.

I did further research and found whole blog sites dedicated to this common problem with Nikon Coolpix cameras of all styles; not just with the L22.  There's a matter of 'thumping' the camera that may bring it back, but it didn't work for me.  I then read from those who were instructed to send their camera in to Nikon for repair, only to be informed later that this problem wasn't covered under the warranty.

However, in many situations, I can not carry an SLR with me; this is where the Nikon L-22 comes in. I have, to date, bought four of these cameras. Every time they have broken, it was because of something I did that caused them to break. I continue to buy them because they are cheep, and pretty decent cameras for the price. They power on/respond to input quickly, shoot good 640 by 480, 30fps AVI videos, and take crisp photos relative to other cameras of a similar price. My only complaint with this camera is that the photos taken without flash or in less than blazing daylight situations have abnormally high noise levels, even for a point and shoot! I mean, what's the point of 12mp when all the fine details are hopelessly speckled? Obviously the people who designed this camera assumed that customers would be happier with a camera that compensated for slow shutter speed and the resulting blur with an ultra sensitive CCD. The least they could have done is added some kind of manual ISO control insted of having it perpetually set to 1600...So, all in all, It is a pretty decent camera, but you get what you pay for.""
"20110308","2.0","L22 Nikon Camera","The first picture In Easy Auto Mode turned out great and thought I bought a good camera. The next two pictures I took the flash did not go off. The flash would not go off oftener than it did and I missed out on a lot of good pictures. Good pictures. Had to switch to Auto Mode and now it works most of the time. In the Play Back mode the time and date are shown on each picture for five seconds and then disappears. There is no way to turn this off and it is very annoying. Every time you go from one picture to the next it appears again.It is a battery eater and every time I have to change the batteries I am afraid the battery cover is going to break off. Very poor set up. The user's Manual is not very user friendly.  My mistake was not returning the camera before the 30 days expired. I would not recommend the camera to anyone.""
"20110308","5.0","One Happy Mother!!!!","this was a great buy; which i bought for my sister who just had her first baby.  It takes great pictures and video. One of the advantages is that it take AA batteries not those special batteries that cost a fortune.""
"20110307","4.0","Great camera so far.","I am very impressed so far with this camera, especially if it holds up for a long time. I have physically compared this camera to a Canon that costs forty dollars more and found the Nikon was capturing more details which to me means a better lens. The Canon might look better and be more space age, but this Nikon is more intuitive to me and has lots of great features. Easy to use I would definitely say.  I could have easily given five stars as cant really find anything to fault. Bottom line to me with a camera is the level of detail found in pictures.""
"20110305","4.0","Compact & Simple","Nothing fancy just a nice, compact camera. I'm still a little old fashioned when it comes to these digital cameras. I don't like the pause in the shutter. I find it hard to keep the camera steady. That's not saying anything bad about this one.""
"20110305","5.0","Happy customer","Someone else recommended that I should buy this camera, and I did so on their recommendation.  I am very happy with the camera, It is very easy to use and gives me lots of options when taking pictures.  And, it was extremely easy to download the software for downloading pictures to the computer.""
"20110304","1.0","PIECE OF CRAP - LENS ERROR, BRUTAL CUSTOMER SERVICE","I NEVER EVEN GOT TO SEE WHAT KIND OF PICS THIS TAKES AS IT NEVER OPENED - 'LENS ERROR AND AS IT WAS A GIFT I HAD NO RECEIPT, MAILED IT TO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY WANTED $100.00 TO FIX IT EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD TELL ME THAT IT HAD NEVER BEEN USED???????? CRAP - WILL NEVER BUY A NIKON AGAIN JUST BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE""
"20110304","2.0","Picture Quality Not Bad if Only the Batteries Didn't Pop Out","I don't have a problem with the picture quality of the Nikon Coolpix L22, considering this is only a point and shoot camera, however, it is most unfortunate that the camera is nearly useless because the cover on the battery compartment won't stay closed.  I first thought that I had a lemon, but I soon learned that the flimsy latch on the battery compartment is a common problem with this camera.  When examining the camera without batteries you probably won't notice that the latch is weak, but with the weight of the batteries, any slight movement will cause the latch to fly open. The problem is so severe that the batteries literally pop out of the camera while you are attempting to take a picture, that makes this camera NOT SO COOL.""
"20110303","5.0","Love it! (uploaded pics)","The L22 is a great camera for the price. The screen is large, and the options for operation are many. It's starts within 2-3 seconds after turning on for that quick shot. It starts in the same mode you left off with, so be aware of what kind of pictures you were taking when the camera was shut off. The AA battery thing is something to get used to, but think of this: You are out in nature with no electricity to charge the in-house battery. ...well a six-pack of AA's in your pocket will definitley come in handy! Battery life seems to be good, I have yet to really put it to the test (got the camera 2 weeks ago). Video is rather good for such a small camera; the time left to record is on the screen. Buy the SD card!! it only has a 16mb memory, so 4/8/16 GB memory card is a must! I will be posting pics soon...(2 hours later...)I uploaded some pics in the gallery. The ease of use makes this camera suitable for a hobbyist photographer like me. The photos can kind of show what is capable, as well as some of the other photos people have uploaded. For the dropped price to 69 bucks, you can't go wrong.One downside is the camera has to be on when downloading shots, so don't forget to unplug the USB and shut it off - battery waster there.... did I mention to make sure to get a memory card...?! get two!! This camera goes with me everywhere, just in case 'the shot' presents itself; 'cause it will be WELL WORTH IT.""

Taking pictures is really fun now, and I see things in a different way, because of this little point and shoot camera. I can get really clear close-ups of flowers and birds, that I could never get before. This camera has many features that I haven't even used yet, but I will continue to learn what this camera can do. It's a great little camera at a great price!""

I have a very expensive camera for myself but this camera can complete with my expensive one at any time. The flash is amazing and I love the fact that it uses AA battery because its easier for my Dad to get new battery from any local store as soon as it runs down. It is a great camera compared to its price.""

"20120405","2.0","Batteries Fall OFF","I bought this camera for my six year old who is very responsible and the first 7 months were good, but now we find ourselves with a Nikon Coolpix that drops the batteries since the back latch was poorly constructed with this design.  I've had my Panasonic camera for 15 years, and even though it is old, I've never experience this as with this Nikon Coolpix model.  I don't recommend this model.  Read reviews before you purchase a 'disposable' Coolpix that will only last less than a year.""

"20120304","2.0","Good pictures for the price-- but very sensitive to any damage","This camera takes good pictures for it's price.  We bought one for our daughter, and she dropped it once and it broke.  Luckily it was under warranty so we had it repaired.  A few months later, it was knocked off a table and hit the ground again.  This time it is gone for good.Yes, I realize it is sensitive electronics, and that dropping it is prone to damage it.  Just a warning to beware if there's any chance it might happen at your house.""

"20110226","5.0","Pics speak a 1,000 words!!","I'm not a camera pro and I do not have super human steady surgeon hands.  The current camera we have at home required x-men stability to take pics of simple non-moving objects.  I bought this because a reviewer had posted a pic they took form a moving vehicle and it was crisp and brilliant.  I wanted something that I could use to take pics without having to freeze time to get good pics. This camera rocks! It's ridiculously simple to use, it runs on easy to get AA batteries, it has a timer, flash features, impecable focus and zooming capabilities and I love that you can have sound to signal shutter and button pushing so you don't have to wonder if it worked or not.  Simply put, if you want a camera that is easy, small, and takes fabulous pics then this is it.  PLUS it's a great great price!! :)""
"20110225","1.0","Battery cover breaks easily","I bought this camera for my girlfriend two months ago. She has barely used it and has definitely not abused it. Today I took it out the the case and notice that the battery cover is open. The extremely thin piece of plastic that's supposed to hold the latch is cracked and broke off. What a terrible design. This camera was great so far but now its essentially garbage. Do not buy this camera. It will NOT last.""
"20110224","1.0","poor poor camara","This camara is absolutely waste of money. Picture quality is awful no matter what setting you use it doesn't give you a clear image. I own a canon an old one and it works twenty times better than this one. Totally  desappointed.""
"20110222","4.0","Battery Life is not very long!","I love this camera but the only problem I have is the battery life. I only used the camera to take pics twice, turning the camera off after every use. The third time I tried to use my camera it did not come on because the battery was too low. I strongly suggest keeping a set of batteries near by when using this camera.""

"20110221","5.0","Great camera!","So far I've enjoyed the camera I recently purchased.  I did some research before I purchased the camera, but mostly I was looking to replace my old Sony CyberShot with something smaller with a larger screen.  I really like the 'idiot proof' nature of the programming.  I'm not too interested in making adjustments like you would with an SLR.  I just need a camera that take consistently good photos of my family and so far, the Nikon fits the bill!""
"20110220","1.0","battery case cover breaks easily.","I purchased 2 cameras-  6 months apart, ( one as a gift) and the small battery  case cover latch has broken off of both of them. Luckily the second one  I returned to the store within days for a replacement but I am stuck with tape on my own camera. I now see this is a common complaint with this camera.""
"20110220","4.0","Decent, but doesn't hold up","I got this camera as a gift for Christmas and it's been great. However, it eats batteries like crazy and today, for no real reason it just decided to stop responding and says 'battery exhausted' even when given new batteries.Definitely a good choice for a somewhat disposable camera, but don't rely on it overmuch.""
"20110220","3.0","GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY","AFTER PURCHASING IT I FOUND IT WAS CHEAPER AT BEST BUY. SO I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BUT I DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT THE CROWDS SO IT WAS WORTH IT AND ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER""

"20110219","2.0","STAY AWAY","Camera gives good quality pictures.  BUT two major problems.  (1)The body is poorly built.  The clasp which keep battery compartment closed is made from plastic and it broke with several openings.  The battery compartment no longer stays closed.  (2)The camera eats batteries.  The batteries take maybe 50 pictures before the the 'batteries exhausted' message appears.""
"20110219","1.0","TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT","I PURCHASED THIS CAMERA WITH GREAT EXPECTATIONS. WHAT A MISTAKE. I HAVE IT NOW ABOUT 3 MONTHS AND HAVE NEVER TAKEN A CLEAR PICTURE. IT SEEMS IF YOU ARE WILLING TO FOCUS THE CAMERA FOR A MINUTE OR BETTER YOU MIGHT GET SOMETHING THAT RESEMBLES A GOOD PICTURE. I NOTIFIED THE COMPANY WITH AN ISSUE REGARDING DOWNLOADING PICTURES AND ERASING THEM FROM MY CAMERA AS ANY CAMERA I'VE HAD ALWAYS GAVE ME THAT OPTION. THE NIKON CUSTOMER SERVICE REP. INFERRED THAT I HAD THE WRONG MEMORY CARD (WHICH I KNOW I DON'T) AND  TOLD ME I COULD RETURN IT FOR REPAIRS AT MY EXPENSE. THAT WAS NOT THE ANSWER I EXPECTED. I OWN AN OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA THAT I HAVE HAD FOR 8 YEARS AND DECIDED TO PURCHASE THIS ONE BECAUSE IT WAS SO MUCH LIGHTER AND EASY TO PLACE IN MY BAG. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS CAMERA TO ANYONE.""
"20110218","4.0","no complaints","My previous CoolPix L22 fell into the water, and fixing it cost more than replacing it. I received this camera quickly and just as described.  No complaints about the seller or the camera!  I would definitely purchase from this seller again.""
"20110217","4.0","over all good but could be better.","pros: high resolution photos with brillant colors, shoots best for still frames and landscapes.cons: can't seem to take a photo indoors without blurring, although it's relatively fast for taking digital photos it can't seem to take photos at parties or in other semi dim lighting (even with flash but especially without.) best for photoshoots, out doors and vacation snapshots.Over all a nice little camera has a number of 'auto shoot' modes (beach, portrait, sunset etc). no real manual options. A little pricey for what it is but a great back up camera.""
"20110217","1.0","Batteries overheat!","This camera will be returned or trashed if seller will not honor return. The camera gets dangerously hot when batteries left inside for even a short period of time. My child cannot even hold this camera as it is so hot. I did not note an online recall for this item. Unlikely we are the only buyers that have noted this.""
"20110217","4.0","Value for money!!","WOW! The camera looks great. I bought it to take pictures of my newborn child and got it just in time. I took all her first shots with it and I was not disappointed.Pros1. Looks great2. Great value for money3. Good picture quality4. Cool features which are a bonusCons1. You have to hold it really still inorder to avoid blurred pictures  Solution: Practice to press the shot button half way before each picture)2. Internal memory is a waste of time (it only holds about 5 pictures)Overall the camera is one of the better cameras below $100 if not the best.""
"20110216","4.0","My boyfriend likes it","I bought this for my man and now he loves it. The only thing I didnt pay attention to before buying this camera was I didnt know it required AA batteries, thats the only thing that bothers me other than that the user manual is very easy to understand and in fact the camera is cool and easy 2 use. I'd recommend it.""
"20110216","3.0","Not what I expected","It took me forever to make a decision when it came to buying a camera, I didnt want to spend a lot of money and wanted a good camera with good picture quality. This camera was not it. Dont get me wrong, its a nice little camera but the picture quality is horrible. Everything looks extremely scratchy, and no matter if the flash is on or not, the picture half the time ends up blurry. I will most like send this product back because I am not satisfied with this product for the the 83 dollars I paid for it. I mean my old 6 mega pixel camera had a better photo quality then this one.""
"20110215","5.0","Great Little Camera","When I purchased this camera I was looking for a reasonable priced camera that would give me the photo quality I wanted with ease of operation.  This Nikon fills the bill.  For the money I don't believe you could find a better camera.  The pictures are great and it's really simple to use.  I am really pleased with this one.  If the need arises I'll buy another Nikon in the future.""
"20110214","4.0","COOLPIX","We haven't taken a lot of pictures with this camera yet, but my wife has been very happy with the ease of use and size.  The picture quality has been very acceptable.  We had purchased one for our 12 year old grandson, and he had a very fine collection of photos before he lost the camera.  I am sure we would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good, compact digital camera.  The purchasing experience with Amazon was also top notch.""
"20110214","5.0","Great for Snapshots","I'm a professional photographer, but I don't always want to lug my expensive camera and camera bag everywhere that I go. If i just want to capture those 'Kodak' moments with the family or do still pix of subjects that aren't moving, I can do that with this 12 MP digital camera. It was new, arrived on time, and the price was better than anything in any store anywhere.""
"20110213","5.0","Big Bang for the buck","Had this camera (blue one) for a year now and it still performs and looks like new, batteries get 200-350 pics depending how long you use the viewer for reviewing the pics. Quality is great and the smart portrait mode works well when looking for the smiling subjects. As far as the zoom I found it much better to take the picture without zooming in and then use the software on the computer to zoom in and crop it there...pic quality is much better that way. If you remember there is a slight lag then you will get great pics if you hold the camera steady until you hear the click, if you don't then the pics will be blurry. I've taken many shots of buildings from a moving boat in the middle of a river and many of people and scenery from inside a moving car and they turned out pretty sharp and colorful. Outdoor shots are amazing and the movie mode is pretty awesome for a small point and shoot like this. Shadows outdoors can be helped by forcing the flash as a fill in. I recommend trying out the different modes the camera offers so you can see which will work best for your situations, after all you needn't worry about wasting film anymore, so take many pics and you'll surely get a few that will be the awesomes ones you wanna print! I have a regular SLR Nikon I rarely used since getting this one because of the pic quality and the compactness of the camera. Liked it so much I also bought the red one for the kids.""
"20110212","5.0","happy customer","The camera is small so it is not a burden to carry around for the price I payed for the camera it is doing a wonderful gob of taking pictures. I bought a underwater housing and strobe for the camers and it is giving me very goog results.""
"20110212","5.0","Fairly good camera","Features and specs are already covered in many reviews. Bought this for my mother and she is happy with it.

Also don't count on this camera to provide you instant photography there is some delay.Pros:1. Low price for fairly great point and shoot specs.2. Boot up time is very quick for such a low cost camera3. Battery door seems sturdy for a low cost cameraCons:1. Slight delay in processing pics2. Camera feels cheap but at this price point it its fairly good3. very Limited shooting options""
"20110212","4.0","Great product for the money","I like the camera, it is worth of money we are spending on.  i dont find any issue, picture quality is also good. and you can take 16:9 aspect photos also.""
"20110205","5.0","Focus!","I have several of these, and have given several to my wife and sons.  We all have had good success with the L series cameras.Several of the lesser ratings talk about blurring of the pictures.  Be aware that these (and many other digital cameras) require you to hold the button down partially for the sensor to activate, measure the lighting and lock into focus.  Then you can snap the shot.  Generally with digital cameras, the 'focus box' will change colors-depends on the brand and/or model.  Also...its a classic case of 'you get what you pay for'.  For lower cost cameras, you will not get the fastest, most responsive sensor system available!Being realistic, I've gotten very good results using these cameras.  Almost all of the Nikon L series CoolPix cameras I have, I've purchased on sale at $100 or less.  For $100 I can not and do not expect the same performance that I get from my $800 DSLR camera.""
"20110204","4.0","Pleasant to work with","This camera is a good buy as it shoots clear pictures and the LCD screen at the back is quite big. Lots of different 'modes' to choose from. One drawback is that it takes a couple of seconds before the camera is ready to take your next photo but hey, for this price it's really a good deal !""
"20110203","3.0","I like it but i don't love it","This is a good camera especially for the price however there are some annoying attributes.Only certain batteries work for a long period ( in my case Duracell) I don't know if this is a norm in digital cameras,other batteries run down very quickly,the quality of the pics are good most times but some come out very blurry(there is no anti-shake feature I guess),also another really annoying thing it that the flash takes a few minutes to load up after you use it. At night when I want to take pics and need to use the flash I can't take the pics one after the other,the flash has to 'charge up'.I bought in in September and last December there was a MINOR incident and the screen cracked! It still works but a crack is staring back at me.I'm not a digital camera expert,this is my first one so I don't know the level of durability on digital camera so it may or may not be just an issue with this particular camera. To end on a good note the camera it self its nice,good weight and you do get good pics.For the price it's  not bad.""
"20110202","5.0","Perfect for Property Preservation Companies!!!","This is the 4th Nikon Coolpix L22 that we have purchased.  We have bought 3 for our business and 1 for our oldest daughter.  We own a property preservation company, which means that we work with banks who require photo documentation of all work performed.  Many of our clients require photos to be date & time stamped.  You wouldn't think this would be difficult, but after searching every electronics store in our area, we were able to find very few.  Beyond that feature, we have also found that this camera is much faster than the Kodak that we tried & in the field, time is money.  The fact that it comes in various colors is an additional PLUS.  This helps when assigning cameras to different crews.Great camera for the price!!!""
"20110131","2.0","Not impressed","Searched for cameras in my price range for a few days, looking at reviews, particularly on Amazon.  Decided this camera looked like a good deal.

It lasted all of ONE MONTH.  Now we will see how honorable Nikon is with their warranty.Forgot to update when I received my reply from Nikon.  Nikon quoted $100 to repair a camera that was under $80 NEW.  The reason for rejection 'Severe misuse and abuse'  Mind you, the camera failed after one month.  There is not one scratch on the camera nor was it 'abused'.  I believe that is Nikon's excuse for not honoring warranties.  I don't know about you but I have to believe an abused electronic item would actually show signs of abuse.  But hey what do I know? Buyer Beware and I WILL NEVER purchase a Nikon product again.""
"20110125","1.0","Nice looking camera; TERRIBLE design and TERRIBLE service","I received this camera for Christmas.  I put the batteries in and the door would not close.  I sent it to Nikon to be repaired, as it was broken when I opened the box. Apparently a VERY SMALL pin was broken.Nikon says the repair is not covered under warranty; the repairs are $73.00.

It was very easy for me to explain to her how to use it and she seemed to pick up on it quickly.  So far she's been very happy with it and has begun taking photo's with this instead of using disposable cameras.  For the price you can't beat it.For those who want any advanced controls and features this camera might be a bit of a dissapointment.  It is definately tailored as a simple automatic point and shoot.""
"20110121","1.0","A Disappointment","I did not buy this camera from Amazon, I bought it as a package deal from Costco, which included camera, case, and 2GD SD card.  The case was a piece of junk, and the flash RAM was overpriced.  The total price would have been lower through Amazon, but Costco gives an additional 2-year warranty.  The main attraction for me was the fact that this camera DOES use AA batteries, which are cheap, readily available, and easily replaced in the field. Having used Nikon film cameras for over 30 years, I thought that the L22 would measure up to Nikon's high standards, but not quite so.  About  half of the shots are blurry, for no apparent reason, and with no discernable pattern.  Multiple immediate, exposures of the same subject on the same spot produced in- and out-of-focus images.  I contacted Nikon support via their web page and was instructed to send them the files for them to check.  However, after reading many reports from other owners of the same problem with this camera and other Nikon digital point-and-shoot cameras, I have decided to return it to Costco for a refund.  I plan to replace it with a Casio digital.""
"20110121","4.0","Good simple camera","I'm still getting used to this product, I thought it would be easier to get used to considering I'm fairly savvy, but there's some weird little tricks - like it automatically defaults to a setting that takes bad photos inside - and I can't figure out a way around them.

"20110121","4.0","Nice, Neat, Nikon!","I am no digital camera expert and have owned only two digital cameras in my entire life, , but I do try to do my research on anything that I purchase and after reading more reviews than I care to think about I decided to buy the Nikon Coolpix L22 12.0MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Red-primary) as a Christmas gift for my wife.  I will keep the other digital camera a 6 MP Sony Cybershot that has served us well as a back-up.The Nikon Coolpix L22 12.0MP Digital Camera is very simple to use, but if you want to make any changes to settings then you will have to go into the settings menu rather than using a dial setting like on many cameras, but I have found that in most cases I use the same settings time and again.  But with practice you can get used to the new way of doing things.The camera arrived on time just before Christmas so I gave it to my wife a little early so she could start getting used to it before the family got together for the holiday.  When we got over to my son's house my wife quickly pulled out her new camera from her purse to take a picture of the grand baby and she fumbled it and it flew out of her hands and onto the hard tile floor, pieces flying every where.  I couldn't help myself and said something to the affect 'Oh well that didn't last long'.  As we started gathering up the what I thought initially were pieces of the camera I realized that it was the two AA batteries that had flown across the floor when the battery compartment opened on impact.  I put the batteries back in the camera and tentatively hit the power button and to my delight it came on and went on to take the sharpest pictures I have ever seen.  There was not so much as a scratch on the camera.  I certainly wouldn't recommend trying such a brutal test, but I would say that it is an indication of the quality and reliability of the camera.  It made me think of the old Timex commercials - 'It takes a licking and keeps on ticking!'.A serious or professional photographer would not want this camera because it does not give them the quick control they want and need over the shots.  If you are a serious or professional photographer than you probably are not reading this review and if you are there is no point in tearing it apart because it doesn't stand up to cameras costing many times more than this one.  After reading some of the negative reviews I feel that the writers are in a different category of camera user than most of us.I paid $80 at Christmas time 2010 and now I see the price has dropped down to less than $76.  At that price I am not going to complain unless the camera doesn't take a fairly decent picture.  This camera takes such clear shots that it can be a little unnerving.  I personally will not take a close-up shot of myself with this camera because you can see every little skin blemish and wrinkle.  These days I prefer blurry photos of myself. ;-)The only reason I gave it less than a perfect 5x5 rating is because I have not used the video much and that I haven't used the camera enough to make that kind of judgement and I have not had any contact with Amazon's Customer Service department and with all the things that I buy from Amazon I suppose that should tell you something.  I will follow-up with another review if there is something worth reporting on.If you want a camera that will take very crisp, sharp, great pictures and is small enough to carry in your shirt pocket or handbag and is an absolute screaming bargain on price then I think that you'll be very happy with this camera.""
"20110121","4.0","Great Camera","I find that for the price, this a fantastic camera.Pros - 'Easy auto mode' chooses the mode for the best picture and works great most of the time. Good color accuracy when in light. Like 10 seconds from button press to shoot (not bad but not great). Great and smooth video especially good for things like youtube and whatnot. Easy transfer from camera to computer; connect with required cable and then just drag and drop.Cons - It has a hard time getting color correctness on close up shots (especially dark close up shots) and it's a PAIN to take a picture of something more than half a foot in front of you because it REALLY doesn't like to focus in close-up shots. It is possible to take close up shots with good color with this camera but it takes several tries and messing with exposure settings (pretty easy to do but it would be nice if it was automatic). Sometimes it has some trouble using drag and drop and the transfer freezes halfway through and you have to cancel and start the transfer again. It happens randomly but it's just a minor inconvenience.But for like 70 bucks, it's FANTASTIC for your money. I got mine for Christmas and for the hobby photographer or family picture-taker, it's well worth the money.""
"20110120","1.0","Worst Camera Ever","I purchased this camera in August b/c I wanted something small and compact.  I learned a valuable lesson: 'You get what you pay for.'  It is now broken: the batteries fall out of the case.  Nikon would not cover the item damage in their warranty.  I am a true believer that this was a bad design and not my fault.  i never dropped the camera or did anything that should have caused it to break in this manner.  They wanted to charge me $76 to fix it and the camera itself was only $100.  I will never purchase another Nikon again..anything Nikon.  I have a CANON that I love it is just rather big.  It is a rebel and is made to take great photos.  The only issue with the CANON is that it is not compact.""
"20110120","4.0","Overall good camera","Bought this as a gift for my 16 year old.  We have had an older Nikon Coolpix for years and been happy with it.  The screen, resolution, flash and battery life are much better on this newer model.  The navigation button aren't as user friendly, easier to hit by accident, harder to switch modes. The buttons feel very flimsy and plastic - I'm worried they will break before the actual camera mechanisms do!  But overall very satified. The pictures turned out well and it's a great camera for a teenager.  I need a new camera too and think I will invest the extra 20-40 to get a slightly nicer coolpix that feels sturdier.""

"20110119","5.0","Very Good Built-in Functions","The Coolpix L22 is a 12 MP camera for people who like to take good quality pictures and edit them in the camera and on a computer but are not interested in making complicated camera adjustments. It comes with a USB cable that allows transfer directly from camera to computer, a hand strap, two temporary batteries, computer photo manager software, a quick start booklet, and a CD with detailed operating information.The 3 inch monitor allows an image to be visible even in bright light and in the dark. I took it to the beach on a clear sunny day, and even with the sun shining directly on the monitor, I could see the image clearly.  In the dark the display is brightly lit. There is a selection of several languages for display messages on the monitor. Date and time including time zones can be set. Pictures can be played back so the photo shoot of the day can be observed and edited.There is a one finger zoom control (best for right handed people) on the top right of the camera.  All you have to do is focus and shoot after selecting a zoom size. It has an automatic face recognition feature that puts the face in focus when you point. The camera also allows you to make 'movies.'The Coolpix has five shooting modes: Easy Auto Mode, Scene Mode, Smart Portrait, Movie, and Auto Mode (more flexible options).  It has a built in flash, self timer, macro setting for close ups, and exposure compensation that brightens or darkens the photo depending on ambient light conditions.You can keep the Coolpix on Easy Auto Mode and use it in most situations. But you can click on many specialty settings in a handy menu by selecting Scene Mode. Examples of these specialty settings include: Portrait, Landscape, Sports, Night portrait, Party/indoor, Beach/snow (the one I used at the beach), Sunset, Dusk/dawn, Night landscape, Close-up, Food, Museum, Fireworks show, Copy (black and white), Backlight (for an object in front of a bright background), and Panorama assist.The Coolpix L122 package is designed for quick learning of the camera's function. The Quick Start will get you going, but the detailed information and examples on the CD Manual will make you an expert on the camera in an hour. Once you know all about it, you realize it is the perfect camera for travel. My wife is a tour guide and is usually very busy on trips. She likes to take a lot of pictures and does not have time to make complex camera adjustments. She will be going as a passenger on a trip to China in Spring, and she will be able to use the point and shoot and special settings on the strictly controlled tour.This is an outstanding camera that was shipped on time and arrived in perfect condition. It was offered at a very affordable price. I give it my highest recommendation.""

"20110109","3.0","Its OK for the money","I bought this camera just before Christmas because I dropped my HP camera and broke it. I wanted a basic camera under $100 but one that still rated really well with Consumer Reports. This one was rated OK with CR (it liked the S3000 better but more $$). Since my HP camera was like $59 I figured this would be fine.When I first got it and took some test shots. It took nice pictures (I was in a well lit room). But I went to a party a week later and was trying to get some pictures of my friend dancing (a truly rare occasion that HAD to  be captured on film). The camera refused to take a good picture. They came out dark, blurry - just awful. On my HP I could force the flash. If this camera has that option, Nikon has done a phenomenal job hiding it. HP just put a flash button so it was very easy to figure out. Often when I go to take the picture and click to take it, nothing happens. I hold the button down and nothing. I release and click again, THEN it decides to take the picture. Meanwhile, my audience is trying to be patient and hold the pose. Annoying.The video is also just OK. It is definitely better in well lit situations.So I rate the camera as 'OK' because it does take good pictures in good lighting. I read somewhere that someone was having trouble getting Kingston brand memory cards to work but mine (4gb) works just fine.I'll keep the camera rather than deal with the hassle of returning it but if I had it to do over again, I probably wouldn't buy it.""

After getting the camera for Christmas, it quickly became apparent that the camera was definitely low end.  The first 5 pictures that I took were blurred beyond recognition because it took about 3 seconds to take them AFTER pushing the button.  To make matters worse, the camera will NOT zoom out.  This isn't a hardware issue, but instead a software issue; the camera tries to recognize faces, stabilize the image for movement as well as auto select an optimal scene selection.  All these things happening together takes up so much of the cameras processor that it can't activate the servo to zoom in.  turning these things off and selecting a scene mode improves this, but doesn't fix it completely and at that point you've turned off the main selling points of the camera.  After putting it on a tripod and having everyone sit still in a well lit room, the pictures were still incredibly grainy and some were still blurred.

"20101231","1.0","Those other reviewers are trying to trick you","Don't be fooled by the good reviews. I bought this camera for two basic reasons. I like using AA batteries because I always have the rechargeable ones at my house. I don't need a special camera charger. I can just grab batteries and go. Never have to wait. And #2 was because of the great ratings on Amazon.But I was tricked.There is way too long of a delay when switching between modes, the pictures come out blurry 8 out of 10 times, the colors on the LCD screen do not match the colors on the actual picture, the flash whitewashes everything.When you normally see a camera flash you think 'I'm done, now I can move.' But not so with this thing. There is this slight delay. When the subjects think the picture was taken, the camera is still taking the picture, but they have started moving, and then it comes out blurry. But you don't see the result of the picture for about another 1 or 2 seconds. But by that time most of your people have already gone on with their lives. Now you have to ask them to pose again.Then you have color issues. The LCD screen is the viewfinder and you will see a yellow tinted picture, but then the actual picture will come out brighter, especially with the flash. The flash just overpowers and washes out everything.Also, the image stablizers cause a delay in what you see on the screen as compared to real life. As if the processor is running too slow. What is on the screen is about half a second off from real time, and is a bit choppy. They should have stuck with the viewfinder.We used the camera for 1 week and realized it was just worthless, and we are returning it. Either the camera is defective or the design is just cra- not well thought out- p.Here were some common phrases said while using the camera:'Wait, can you guys come back the picture came out blurry.''Oh you moved too much''Wow  the flash is too strong''Sorry, it takes like 2 seconds to snap'It is horrible for those candid shots. We ended up using our camera phones.So go right out and buy one today and give it as a gift to someone you hate. Merry Christmas.""
"20101231","4.0","pretty good overall","We got this camera as a Christmas present for our family bc we've been wanting a nice and compact camera that would take fairly decent pictures and not take too much time playing with settings.  We really like the camera for these aspects.  The only issue I've had w/ photo quality is that sometimes the camera will decide not to use the flash for you, and I don't like this feature.  I'd prefer to choose whether or not I want the flash.  It's not that I can't choose this option myself, but I have to change settings when I'm trying to take a picture sometimes, which is just a little annoying, but happens rarely.  The video quality is decent, not great, but I don't really expect it to be more than that from a small relatively cheap camera.As for durability, I didn't give it a high rating bc we haven't had it that long so I don't feel like I really know yet.  We did have one incident in which I placed the camera on the floor while the lense was going back in.  I didn't realize it hadn't gone in yet, and the lense got stuck.  At that point we thought I had just broken a brand new camera.  Thankfully we were able to fix it and I have been more careful.  Another thing about durability w/ this camera is that it's plastic.  I'm sure it will get some scratches eventually, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not durable.I only gave 3 stars for delivery bc it came a day late.  That's not too bad, but if they tell you the camera's coming on Wed. and you dont' get it, you start to wonder if someone may have stolen it.  Also since it was delivered by the USPS, I was a little more concerned about whether it got stolen.  However I know they can be slow so I gave it the next day and the camera came.  It was perfect in the packaging - no damage - and everything seemed as it was placed in the package from the factory.Overall, we give this camera 2 thumbs up.""

I returned the L-22 after finding NO monitor for battery power available. I thought I could adapt to the absence of a lithium battery, and become the shopper for a pack of rechargables, but NOT KNOWING where I stand on battery power is unacceptable to me.

The price was good, very competitive, and the product is perfect.  The only problem with this camera is that the automatic focus must be turned on before taking pictures.  Sometimes this is a 'time' problem when capturing images of grandchildren who move very quickly!!  It does a beautiful job once this feature is activated, and the pictures are clear, sharp, and very good.  It is compact, and does not 'eat' batteries like some digital cameras.  It is very easy to use when traveling, and I would purchase it again should it become necessary.  Actually, I already DID purchase it a second time!  Very happy with Amazon purchase and with this camera.""
"20101230","3.0","A Bit Disappointed","I purchased the Coolpix in order to have a good digital camera for my parents' 50th anniversary celebration.  When we used it, many of the pictures looked fine on the camera's viewing screen, but were fuzzy and blurred when viewed later on the computer screen.  I understand that resolution will be better the smaller the image is, but the pictures were not lacking in resolution- they were just plain blurred- like the photographer moved.  This should have shown up better on the camera's screen so the photographer would know to take another shot.  In addition, I was under the impression that the camera had a stabilization feature that would reduce the liklihood of blurred shots due to camera movement, but perhaps I misunderstood that feature.  A number of the pictures had questionable color quality.  Reds looked like hot pink, and it was not possible to properly correct the red color without affecting other aspects of the photos, such as skin tones.In order to be fair, it is not the top of the line model, and maybe my expectations were too high for the model I purchased.  It is possible that some of the problem lies with the operator and not the camera.  I hope that photo quality improves as I gain more experience with it.  I am not giving up on it yet!On the positive side, it is a nice, compact, lightweight camera, yet it appears to be well-made and durable.  The controls are simple to understand and easy to use.  The screen is a nice size.""

I didn't use the flash often, but each time I did I could only take about four pictures before it said 'battery exhausted'.  Last week, it finally died.  It won't turn on unless I put new batteries in it and the viewfinder is white and the camera won't turn off.  I have to remove the batteries to get it off.  It's the worst camera I've ever had.  I've read the manual and there are no answers for what it does (or doesn't do).  I've tried every battery under the sun and it still won't work.

"20101226","4.0","carry cam to supplement dslr","I use a dslr when I intend to shoot and only rarely use a point and shoot. The reason I got this cam was to have something small to carry around for the 'just in case' moments; for example, on Christmas day I went disc golfing in the snow, and it would have been nice to take a few pics to post on facebook. The problem was that there was no way I was going to lug my 20d with a $700 dollar lens around in the snow for a few hours to get a few random pics. So I hit wal-mart and looked for something small, that took regular batteries, and could be stuck in a pocket or disc golf bag, and was cheap. This cam was the lowest priced item to fit the bill.I'm not a pro, but I regularly use a 20d or 40d (canon rules in dslr cams), have good glass, use a good flash, shoot only in RAW mode, fairly proficient in photo shop, and spend a good deal of time taking pics and post processing, so I have pretty high standards. I've also had a few p&s's, which take good pics in daylight, horrible pics indoors, and with the flash, take horrible pics in the opposite direction. So here's my review.....not comparing to dslr's, but in getting a decent pic in situations where you're not intending to shoot, but tucked a cam in your pocket just in case something interesting pops up.I set the cam up for the highest quality jpeg (memory is cheap, 4 gig cards are only $10 and hold over 500 pics). put the cam in auto mode, and disabled the flash. The controls are dirt simple, and except for the jpeg quality, can all be done easily with the buttons on the back of the cam. ISO is set internally and you can't mess with it; it seems to stay on the low end, which is normal for outdoors, gives a seemingly slow shutter speed indoors. With a little care to hold steady, I got fairly sharp pics at 1/6 sec shutter speed ( slow shutter leads to blur because you move during the time it takes to snap the shot). There is obvious noise reduction built in which give the pictures a 'smooth' look, but cuts out a lot of the graininess that you get shooting indoors. All this means that the pics kind of have a little blurry look inside in low light, but for what your using, it's not all that bad. It looks to me that the outside pics have a touch of this also, but still yields acceptable pics. Outside, the auto white balance is good, inside during the day auto seems good too. Night need the setting changed to the type of lighting and its pretty good. If you don't change it you get the reddish orange hue to the pics. If you use the flash, you get that blown out look all p&s's have; too me it's just not pleasing. The exposure comp. matches what you see in the display and lets you get decent shots when theres back light situations. If you're a post processor you can get even dramatically better results if you know what you're doing.Overall, knowing what the limitations of this kind of cam are, I am impressed. If you understand exposure and how light works, you can get pretty darn good shots with a few button clicks. If you don't, the auto mode guesses what you're trying to do and gets it mostly right. If you are serious about photography, these types of cams aren't for you as a primary cam. If you're looking for something better than a phone camera thats cheap and easy to use, this fits the bill. If you're a serious photography looking for something that stays in the glove box or a coat pocket so you can get a shot without having something the size of a toaster hanging around your neck, this is a good cheap solution.""

This is his first real camera (others had been 'throw aways') and he had asked for a digital camera to take on a trip being planned for next Spring. He will be travelling to Europe with a class from school; however, they are not allowed to bring chargers for phones, MP3 players or cameras. So, we had to find a digital camera that would operate on batteries and we wanted a known brand name. This litle camera fits the bill and he loves it. It takes great pictures, just point and shoot; for a novice, that's great. He has plenty of time to practice with it and learn other features. The camera case is very sturdy and can be hung off a belt and still give easy access to the camera. We don't think we could have chosen a better digital camera for him. He's happy and we're happy""

If you have large hands, you might find the camera a bit small but again this is typical for the form factor.Nikon designed the camera to use AA batteries (rechargeable or alkaline), which is a plus because finding replacements is easy and inexpensive.Overall, highly recommended.""

Its more for people like me who are more looking for something good that wont cost them a bundle because they use it in high breakage risk scenarios. I'm 19. I go through electronics like that! In fact I had bought this camera once and within 3 hours my nephew dropped it and it broke so I bought it again. I get everything as high tech as possible and have had an ipod since I was 13. That being said,  I love this camera! I do eventually want to get an SLR but for now this camera takes an amazing picture and the price is right. For concerts, going out with friends, or family gatherings - you wont be disappointed with the pictures you get.Pros: Simple to use, big viewing screen, records video with good sound, takes AMAZING picturesCons: Takes a moment between pictures. After you take a picture you have to wait a moment before you can take another.Overall: I would in a heart beat buy this camera a third time!""

And its not me.  I have owned many cameras.  I only bought this as I read it was a good camera and it was cheap and small.  I didn't want to bring my big expensive canon on trip.  And NO I did not expect canon slr quality out of this camera.  But this Nikon Coolpix L22 is such a piece of trash in my opinion that it doesn't flash when it should and does in bright sunlight.  It never worked in dark light settings (the flash never worked).  And the automatic settings never adjusted correctly to the environment.  The auto rotate only worked occasionally when I tuend to camera sideways to take a picture.  Most pictures were not focused.  The face detection never worked right - and not once recognized more than one face in the shot.  This is absolutely the worse camera I have ever used.  Its not worth 5 bucks.  And I can not return it as my kids threw out the box before we left on trip.  Ugggh.""

I have purchased similar cameras for other of my grandchildren, and have found that even 'entry-level-plus' grade cameras from Nikon are a cut above the competition. I believe that photography is an acquired skill, and getting good quality photographs during the learning process avoids the discouragement that often accompanies cheap camera results.. Nikon doesn't install sub-par lenses. The versatility of digital cameras has enabled new snapshot artists to grow into accomplished photographers much sooner than in the film photo era..

We really liked this camera's features and felt that it was doing a good job meeting our needs for a point and shoot camera.  However, within 4 months the latch on the battery/memory card door broke.  It just broke.  The camera was not dropped or abused in any way.  We always handled it with care.  When not in use or traveling with the camera, we kept it in a padded camera bag.We followed the instructions to the letter for returning the camera to Nikon for repair or replacement under the warranty.  Nikon refused to take care of us, their customer, under the warranty.  They claimed that the damage was due to 'an impact', despite our statements of the fact that it hadn't been dropped.  They more or less told us that we were lying.  They would repair the camera for $103, which is more than a new one costs.  I had them send our broken camera back to us.  We are trying to use the camera by taping the battery door shut.  We are telling everyone we know not to buy a Nikon. The battery/memory card door latching mechanism is weak and the Nikon customer service is poor.  Wish we had bought a Canon, like our other cameras.""
"20101118","5.0","Nice pocket point-and-shoot","I've always felt that you get better pictures out of a 'normal size camera' as opposed to these tiny ones that fit in your pocket.  While I still feel that way, I must say that so far I am pleased with this Coolpix L22.  I still love my bulkier Sony camera, but let's face it... sometimes you wish you had a small camera that would just slip in your pocket.  I was hesitant to choose one, but after spending some time reading reviews here, I decided to give it a try.There are mixed reviews here but overall I find that it takes pretty nice pictures.  I've always had better luck with digital cameras if you give it some time to focus by holding the shutter half-down before taking the shot.  Sure you can just slam the shutter button down to take a pic, but it seems to me that this method tends to rush the focus, sometimes resulting in a bad pic that otherwise might have been okay.So does this camera ever take bad pics?  Sure it does, and so does my Sony that cost several hundred dollars more.  If you are using automatic settings and you are not a professional photographer, you will always take an occasionally bad picture.  And virtually all cameras have difficulty with focus and grain in low light (unless you use manual settings and know what you are doing.... and have a tripod that would allow you to use proper low light settings without creating a huge blur).  Overall though for what it is and the convenience it offers, I am quite pleased with it (and I can be picky sometimes).  I have taken some of my best pictures with my Sony and also some of my worst.  This camera is no exception.I've also seen some reviewers complain about the fact that it uses AA batteries.  Normally I agree with that too.... I'd rather use a rechargeable battery pack.  Keep a spare always charged and you are good to go.  They usually last much longer than a couple AA batteries too.  HOWEVER, one of the reasons I chose this camera is *because* it uses AA batteries.  We tend to use this camera when we are in the middle of nowhere (i.e. in the forest) and it's nice to know that all you need with you is a pack of batteries that you can buy virtually anywhere.  Our flashlight, GPS and camera all use the same AA batteries which is very convenient for us.""
"20101117","2.0","Very mediocre photo results. Video quality is better. Several intermittent issues.","Hugely disappointing camera. Mediocre flash photo results, purple fringes, severe noise in low light, and intermittent issues. Positives are good video results, bright LCD screen, and good-enough results in bright light. The battery compartment latch is useless, and has to be held together with a rubberband.This is my first Nikon camera. The combination of the price and the fact that it is a Nikon led me to purchase this camera. I have been using Canon cameras for 15+ years, and was very eager to try this barebones point-and-shoot Nikon. Needless to say, it has been a huge disappointment. Maybe I got a lemon, or maybe at the price this is the best I should expect to get.The positives:- Cute size.- Attractive red color.- LCD screen is bright.- Video results are good.- No settings to tinker around with, so a good option for someone looking for a simple camera.Negatives- The latch that holds the AA batteries in the hold is flimsy. The grip that holds the latch shut is so thin that the latch pops open at the slightest touch. You need to use a rubberband to hold the latch in place.- Photo results are very mediocre. In bright light the results are ok, but you can see a purple tinge at the edges. In low light the results are very grainy. The graininess is the result of the camera automatically choosing a high ISO rating.- In low light the flash does not do a good job of adequate lighting.- The photos look to be very much on the soft side. It's either that or they look out of focus.- Sometimes the camera just does not shoot. You have to switch off and switch on the camera back to take a photo.Nonetheless, for those looking for a basic digital P&S I would not recommend this camera to anyone.""

Battery usage is above average(with lithium), I found the camera SO easy to use, easy to navigate, shutter was flawless, very quick( using a class 10, 4mg card), and overall was TACK SHARP on the images. Let me repeat, TACK SHARP on the images after reviewing on my Mac. My only major criticism is not to expect much with the zoom fully extended, the images are less than clear, although using a tripod helped this somewhat. I was pretty blown away with the shots, for a $95.00 point and shoot! The super-clear shots were the proof, and build quality was good, LCD screen was fairly good as far as resolution. Overall this is a nice, well-built, great-shooting pocket camera with good features, ease-of-use, and tack-sharp images, highly recommended.""

I had ordered the camera thinking it would be simple to operate and would take better pictures than my previous digital camera.  Although the zoom was stronger and more megapixels, taking pictures from a distance is still very disappointing.  When trying to enlarge the pictures to print, they become fuzzy and a waste to process.On Veterans Day, I had taken quite a number of parade pictures and proceeded to download to my computer.  I had some older pictures on the memory card which had already been successfully downloaded to my computer. I was able to view all the new pictures I had taken on the camera, but when I plugged in the USB cable, no pictures would download except for the older pictures, about 15, which were still on the camera.  I called technical support about the issue, and he told me to take the memory card to a local store to process.  I did this, but the pictures were no longer on the memory card as the rep assured me they would be.  Somehow, the camera must have deleted all the important pictures I had taken.  This was very distressing to lose all my pictures.Also, the battery cover is extremely difficult to close.  What I had hoped for in a simple to use camera is a total disappointment with this Nikon. Included with the camera was a minimal instruction manual. A more complete instruction manual was in the form of an instruction CD that could be downloaded to the computer for reference.  This is totally unacceptable.  I questioned the tech support about this and he said it is part of the going green initiative not to send a printed version.This camera is a total puzzle to me as I have never had a digital camera that deleted pictures without my intentionally deleting them.  I am very distressed with this beautiful little camera, and hope that Amazon will allow a return on it.""

For the price we paid for it, this camera far exceeded our expectations. The pictures are of great quality, especially outdoors. We have taken some stunning photos with this camera. The performance of this camera in low light conditions is not very good but that is expected for cameras in this price range. However, you can improve the quality of images considerably if you forget about the easy auto mode in this camera. It works very poorly and pictures are often blurry. If you don't use the easy auto mode and make some manual adjustments in the settings, the pictures are excellent even in low light. Wife and I took over 1,000 pictures recently during our vacation and we did not get a single blurry image after making the adjustments I mentioned previously. Again, the easy auto mode works very poorly and pictures often come out blurry. If you change the settings in the camera and make manual adjustments, the pictures come out great. This camera also shoots standard quality video. I highly recommend this camera if you can get a very good deal on it. It is worth it even if you consider its flaws. The manual is helpful in guiding you through the different manual settings. Overall, we rate this product 4 stars.""

"20101023","3.0","Shouldn't modern technology be better than it was 2 years ago?","I had a Samsung L100 that was probably the best camera I'd owned until it broke earlier this year. It seemed like the camera couldn't do anything wrong when it came to taking pictures, though the video recording left a bit to be desired. When it broke, I first tried my luck with the Fujifilm FinePix JZ300...and it was the first camera I ever rated 1 star (and I don't just give that rating out). So my next attempt was this Nikon Coolpix L22 here. I'd owned a Coolpix a few years earlier, and it took decent pictures. Oddly enough, this one takes slightly worse pictures, and there's a trick to getting non-blurry ones. That shouldn't be the case with what's considered a simple point and click camera. Keep in mind that I'm no professional photographer, nor am I one of those people who calls themselves one just because they take a lot of pictures and thinks the title fits. It's just a hobby, plain and simple. But I do know clarity and detail when I see it, and when it's missing.First things first, yes, most of the time your pictures will be blurry when using this camera on the Auto setting. You can set the camera down on a table or something with the self-timer on, and take a picture of something that's immobile, and chances are that it'll be blurry in the picture. Why? I don't know. But get this- there's a trick to getting an ok picture on Auto: zooming in just a little bit. I know, it sounds stupid, but the only time I'm ever able to get good pictures if when I turn the Macro setting on, and when I zoom in a tiny bit. If I zoom a little more or not at all, the picture is a mess, and not worth keeping. Some of the special settings like Sunset and all that can make for good pictures and set the mood beautifully, but after trying out all of them several times over the last 4 months, only 5 have been helpful.Other poor features worth mentioning include the random times it takes to process a picture. Sometimes you'll take a picture, and it'll be done immediately, ready for another. But then there'll be times when you'll wait between 5 and 20 seconds (yes, TWENTY seconds) before you can take another. And the times really are random too, they don't depend on how complicated the image was. Taking a picture of a full moon: just the black night sky and the white moon took 11 seconds once, while a ton of gorgeous fireworks that filled took a quick 2 seconds. Another time, the same full moon picture was 1 second deal. Crazy, but true. Something positive I can say for it though is that the battery life is very good. I've never even seen the Low Battery warning pop up, even on the 4th of July when over 300 pictures and a dozen or so 5+ minute videos were recorded.When it comes down to it, this camera isn't worth the full price I paid for it. At the current price it's going for, you could certainly do worse (Fujifilm, I'm lookin' at you), but if you can try out cameras in the store or have friends with cameras that you can test out, do that before blindly ordering this. Maybe I'll try hunting down another Samsung L100...""

I love the color of images and the wide view of the screen. It's quite easy to use but it still have cons.The most inconvenient thing is the AA batteries. It seems to be cheap in the first place but in the long run, you have to buy a lot of batteries to replace. The second thing is the size. It's not very small and doesn't fit my hands. I can hardly put it in my pocket cos it's quite big. Another con I see in this camera is the video quality. It's not very good as image's. The sharpness and contrast are not very good. The function of capturing movement is very bad. I can't even take a picture of my kid playing with his cat. The pictures are really blur.In general, with that reasonable price, this camera is worth to buy. I will recommend to my friends.""

"20111024","1.0","Another battery latch problem","Bought this camera in Dec 2010.  It has worked great but then, as others have also reported, the battery latch broke (in Sep 2011). I figured it would be covered under the warranty so I sent it in to their Melville, NY facility for repair. However, Nikon are trying to wriggle out of fixing it for free under the warranty (they want $76) by claiming that the battery latch must have been broken by misuse/abuse/accident.  The warranty states that the only part not covered are the actual batteries themselves - it says nothing about excluding the battery latch from warranty repair.  The camera was not dropped or otherwise abused - the battery latch broke while I was replacing the batteries.  It should last longer than 9 months.  They don't seem to understand the idea that a battery latch may be broken simply because it was defective. I appealed to a supervisor today who said they will review my case and get back to me via email in 24-48 hours. This camera is worth 4 or 5 stars for quality of picture but I can give it only 1 star due to the battery latch failure combined with Nikon's reluctance to honor their 1 year warranty.""

"20101006","5.0","Great camera for the price!...an update 10-17-2010...","See updated comment below.For the money you can't beat this little camera...for the folks who are complaining about blurry photos, this isn't a $1,000 DSLR...there is some shutter lag, as with all inexpensive digital cameras; take that into account and you'll be fine:  so far I haven't had any difficulties capturing crisply and clearly the smoke rising from my BBQ grill (it helps if you use the right shooting mode for the right shot, too; for that I used the sports/action mode).  The micro mode is great!  Another thing that helps prevent blurry photos is to use a tripod!  Especially if you're shooting important landscapes or portraits.  (Helpful hint:  when using a tripd you may want to turn image stabilization off...try a shot both ways and see which you prefer.)  As for battery usage...most cameras eat batteries if you're shooting a lot, which is why every photography book/course/instructor/owner's manual tells you:  carry extra batteries!  Now let's talk video...I am so delighted with the great videos this little camera makes!  I had a small digital camera which I paid half again as much for, and my Nikon takes better videos.  Again, folks, this isn't a $1,000 DSLR; don't expect it to be, and you won't be disappointed.  I highly, highly recommend this camera!  It goes with me everywhere I go, and it has not disappointed me yet as I put it through its paces.UPDATE:  10-17-2010:  I took this little camera to Biketoberfest, and in the sports/action mode using a panning technique I got crystal clear photos of the bikes as they went by me.  I shot several movies and the sound was awesome, and the movies are sharp as a tack!  The batteries, which I have had in the camera since I bought it, lasted all day and were still going strong.  The micro mode is very impressive...you can get as close as 2' to your subject.  The more I use this camera, the more I'm impressed with it and happy I bought it!!""

"20100923","5.0","A great point and shoot for a low price","I was traveling in Europe and in a moment of madness set my camera down and did not keep an eye on it. For some reason in ran away (along with my rain jacket).In some ways it was liberating traveling without a camera. While everyone else was trying to take a picture of Rembrandt's Night Watch, I could actually study the painting without distraction (other than all the other folks who were trying to take a photo without flash). Moreover, I did not want to spend time trying to find a camera store. In addition, I did not want to end up with a camera with a rechargeable battery that used a European or British end plug.Fortunately, when I was in York, UK, I walked by a large electronic store in the old town. I asked if they had a camera that takes AA batteries, and behold they produced a Nikon Coolpix L22. The price was about US $100.I found the camera easy to fit in my pocket to keep it safe. The Nikon system has a number of point and shoot modes. It is very basic and would not suit a serious photographer. I also have a Pentax Digital SLR, which is a lot to carry if all you want are some basic photos of your trip. I have only viewed the photos on my computer and most look sharp. I tried a lot of the various shooting modes, resulting in some poorly exposed photos if I used an improper mode.All in all I am pleased. It is a better camera (more megapixels) than the one that was stolen. I would have paid more for a camera with more user controls for exposure, so long as it used AA batteries. Unfortunately very few AA battery cameras are being sold anymore.""

Needed a pocket camera for a trip I was taking and though I didn't know much about it, my old camera died so I took a chance on this one. It seems pretty well made, and judging from the abuse it got on it's maiden voyage, it should hold up well. It was the only camera I took, so I was asking a lot from it. I took nearly 500 pictures and a few videos on the original alkaline batteries that came with it. I find that unbelievable. There were a small percentage that were out of focus, but in general the performance was very acceptable. The camera is pretty easy to use and takes good pictures. I rarely print over 4' x 6', so my prints (and screen appearance) have nice color and sharpness. I was using a mid-range setting (5M) so it's capable of even better images. The flash tended to be tricky, but when it worked (most likely operator error) it was strong enough to produce good pictures. I'm not sure I would have been as happy had I paid $300 for it, but at $100 I find it a very good deal. Love the AA batteries, a deal maker/breaker for me. There were times I had the only working camera in the group. The only issue I currently have with it is the battery/memory card compartment. I don't like it when both are housed behind the same cover. The construction of this one makes me approach it very carefully, and the card is hard to remove.""

My mom bought it for me because I recently moved from Atlanta, Georgia to Provo, Utah and needed a camera. I was able to take crystal clear pictures even while driving at 70 mph (the speed limit becomes 75 on I-80 from Lincoln, NE onwards)!!! Some of the pictures you can't even tell they were taken by a point and shoot, even with me driving.  Feature wise, I haven't really played around with it so it's all on auto, the flash doesn't wash the picture out at all. Easy to hook up to the computer and transfer the photos. The camera has a nice 'auto-sleep' function that turns the camera off after 3 secs, you can change the timing or turn the feature off. It does take about 5 seconds for the camera to wake-up/turn on (I missed a couple of good shots because of this). The digital zoom gets in nice and tight and remains clear, the optical zoom gets fuzzy and shakey even with the anti-shake feature turned on. The buttons are perfectly placed (I have smallish hands) for easy use.Other than the slowish turn on/wake-up time, I love the camera. But what do you expect, it's a Nikon.""

When I'd force the Flash off, I'd wind up with blurry photos.  I am not a professional photographer but with a point and shoot camera like this, I expect to turn it on, take a picture, and quickly come away with something useful - that did not happen here as it did with my previous 5 MP Casio.The price was right for me (Free) and I see that Amazon also has this camera for less than 100 dollars - I guess what they say is true - 'you get what you pay for'.

It truly is a point-and-shoot camera, taking roughly a second to snap a picture. The menus and settings are very intuitive, and there seems to be a setting for every occasion. Close ups, parties, outdoors, sports, and lots lots more, even a built in panorama assist! The included software, Panorama Maker 5, has allowed me to make some scenes that look very professional. Closeups are very sharp, but it does take a little maneuvering to make the camera focus on the object you want, rather than bringing the background into focus instead. The end result is splendid, so the extra effort isn't all that bad of a price to pay.The only reason I gave this camera 4 stars is the fact that it's a bit of a battery hog. After an hour or so of shooting, it has already drained the two AA's to 65%. (When you hook the camera up to your computer, it tells you the remaining battery life and memory!

"20100905","4.0","Captured Some of the Most Important Moments","My older camera, an Olympus from 2003, had suffered the Lens Failure death so common to digital point and shoots, and I needed a new camera for a BIG reason: our son was getting married. It had to be a decent price, because weddings have enough expenses without new cameras, and it had to work well in light and dark, because they were getting married in the early evening.So, after an exhaustive review of the middle of the road point and shoots, I settled on the Nikon L22. And was very pleased with the results. Once my husband and I figured out the fairly easy to learn menu of options, we were consistently taking good photos, close up and at a distance. The pictures of the wedding were great! But we've also used it for some lovely pictures in the garden, and some sightseeing pictures, as well.If you want a camera that will do ALL the thinking for you, this isn't your camera; you do need to make some choices under varying conditions. On the other hand, if you want a camera that takes both great still photos and video, this isn't your camera, either; the video is passable, but not great. But if you want a camera that will take crisp, great pictures, and is small enough to carry in an evening bag (!) this IS your camera.""
"20100905","4.0","Good snapshot camera, sometimes slow","This is a nice camera to have as a point-and-shoot. The AA bateries instead of charger can have its pros and cons..  the major advantages (to me) are:1. No need for a charger. One less thing to worry about and keep track of.2. If the battery goes empty in the middle of the day, AA batteries are available everywhere (or you can take a spare couple).If you want to save on batteries, you can always get rechargeable ones.The main dislike about this camera is that sometimes it takes a (really) long time to take the shot. Not sure why as I also have one other similar model (Nikon Coolpix S220) and it doesn't take half as long. This causes quite a bit of frustration and in my opinion, Nikon gets its brand detiriorated more than it saves money.Still, a nice camera, especially for people who don't know much about which settings to use and just want to use the one button to take shots.""

"20100902","4.0","Beautiful pictures but goes to sleep to fast.","For the price the photos are beautiful.  I tend to use disposable batteries because they're easier to manage when planning a day of shooting the camera.  The ONLY thing I do not like about this camera is that it goes into 'sleep' mode too quickly.  I've missed many, many shots by raising the camera to point and shoot only to have to half-press the shutter button to wake the camera up, only to have missed the good shot.  I use this camera mostly for photos of my young grandson, on the job, as well as the movie clip feature.  I plan to replace this camera with the same one whenever I need to but it bugs me when the camera snoozes on me.""

"20100826","4.0","Got what I wanted at this price","If you are on a very very tight budget (air ticket took the most part of my budget already) and don't want to pay anything over $100, this is the camera for this price.  Below is my feedback after taking a couple of hundred pictures in a trip to Hong Kong.Pros:-low price-pictures are of good quality (12mega) and over 95% of them were in good focus and clear.  I printed about 150 pics (including Disney World in HK) on photo paper thru PhotoMax in Hong Kong for Mom in law and they came out very well.  They look good on computer too.-took about 10 video clips.  They all worked well on computer when replaying (the camera does not have HD format support yet in its video).-use AA batteries (I know some people do not like this as it makes the camera a little bigger - anyway just a little bigger only and OK with me) but I like it because if the battery runs out by accident and I have no replacement handy, I can purchase anywhere easily.  BTW, I had 4 rechargeable AA batteries and this camera took 2 at a time and so most of the time I did not run into the need to buy new battery.  You can take a lot of pics with just 2 batteries.  The only one time we had to purchase new batteries was because we forgot to bring the other 2 batteries out and the ones in use ran out.  This is much better than when a camera is using other type of batteries and you forgot to bring them out and you won't be able to use your camera in that case at all.-flash is OKCons:-the mode that has face detection just does not work.  If you use that mode, the pictures you got would be extremely extremely disappointing and that's why some other reviews here said that the pictures from this camera were very poor and this was because they probably have selected that mode.  If you stay away from using that and select other mode, the picture would come out just fine.  With that said, you are not really getting all the features that you pay for here.  Even this camera is cheap, the price per each working function may be more expensive than the others.  But too bad, I cannot spend more than $100 for a camera in my budget and so I have to stick with it (still better than not being able to get a camera at all).-the sports mode is only 1/250th second and its much slower than most of other camera (1/1000th second).So if you cannot afford more than $100 like me and you only care about taking reasonable good pictures easily (no sports - sports mode is slow), this may be the right camera for you.  If you can spend more than $100, you should check out something else and you can get better sports mode and higher zoom power, etc.Hope this helps.""
"20100826","3.0","Would return it if I could","I needed a new camera that was a s easy to use as my old Canon.  I read up on this camera and felt it was a user friendly, good quality camera.  I'm finding that its very slow to make it available to snap another picture and a lot of time, the pictures have come out very fuzzy. I would not recommend this camera.

"20100813","5.0","Awesome Camera :-)","Let me start off by saying that my last camera was a 3.5 MP and it was good for what I used it for but I let it bounce off the floor one to many times and it has died. That is when I started to look around for other easy to use good quality cameras. I looked at a lot of my friends cameras and started to read all the reviews.One of my friends had the Nikon L20 and he loved it. I tried it out too and loved it but I then found out that the L22 was replacing the L20. I asked around and found a friend that had the Nikon L22 and he let me use it for a weekend. What a very nice camera. It did everything I wanted it to do and then some. All the pictures and videos looked awesome to me and I did not have one problem with it at all. All the pics were sharp and focused. What more could you want? East to get batteries! Yup this camera uses AA batteries and I had a boat load of them. Everything in my house seems to use AA batteries so a long time ago I switched everything in my house to rechargeable NiMH AA batteries. They last forever in this camera. Say if you were at a wedding or something and your batteries run out. Just go to your local corner store and get a few easy to find AA batteries or just bring a few extra from home. Life is easy for me. I hate the proprietary batteries that come with most cameras. The other good thing about this camera is it uses standard SD and SDHC memory cards. I got a 8GB SDHC card for $19.00 bucks. It gave me something like 2,200 available pics to take at 12MP. Needless to say I purchased this camera in sliver from Amazon.com and I take it everywhere with me. Remember it is a $100.00 dollar camera and not a $500.00 dollar camera. It doesn't have all the high end features like touch screen but it has everything I want and it takes really nice pics. I don't think you'll go wrong with the Nikon L22. Get it. Trust me :-)""
"20100813","1.0","It's a Lemon!","I brought this camera for my daughter. I thought I couldn't go wrong with a Nikon. Big mistake. After about a month it stopped turning on. I took it in for service and they replaced it. The new (reconditioned) camera worked for about 6 months then it wouldn't turn on. Back in for service. The 'fixed' it. It was good for about another 2 months then the same thing. I had that camera in and out of the shop for 2 years until it's extended warrenty finally was up - and now it is dead for good.  If you want a good camera - get a Fuji. I use and abuse a Fuji Finepix everyday for work. It has NEVER failed me or been in the shop in 5 years! It is bigger than the Nikon - but does so much more.""

Other reviewers that haven't liked the indoor pictures probably just selected wrong setting.  I haven outdoor pictures and indoor pictures of my home for listing on the internet, and all the pictures are very good. This camera is an excellent choice for a realtor.  I think the camera is very pretty with the chrome against the matte black.  Large screen.

Low light needed the subjects to be still and a steady hand.  Great value for the money.  The extra optical zoom set this camera ahead of the pack.  Most in the class only have 3x this one has 3.8x. The fact that it takes standard AA batteries was a huge plus when the recharagble batteries ran out.  You will need to buy your own rechargable batteries and charger this unit does not come with them.  Many in this class do.  This is my only knock.""
"20100803","5.0","Much better than expected","I bought this camera for my 7 YO this past Christmas to replace a sub-$100 Nikon P&S that failed after 2 years.  I was at first concerned with Nikon's poor reputation for P&S cameras, it has a plastic body, and the need to go into the electronic menu to change basic settings rather than turn a physical dial.  However, this did not at all trouble my daughter and she quickly figured it all out.  NOTE: I'm just in awe of how easily even the youngest kids seem to be able to quickly master complex mobile phones and digital electronics.  It has a decent size viewfinder that's been easy to see in bright outdoor light. The camera has consistently produced satisfying snap shots and 5x7 enlargements (good color and sharpness) and is really easy to use. Battery life is OK and it uses regular batteries so replacements are never an issue.  She loves this camera and I kind of like it too ... when I get the chance to use it.In our experience, it's been a reliable entry level camera.""
"20100803","2.0","Terrible Focus","I bought this camera for the price (on sale at purchase) and because it's so cute.  However, out of 50 pictures only about 15 - 20 come out.  The pics are blurry and it takes too long to focus.  No chance of taking a pic quickly with this camera.  I've missed some great moments and all too frequently have to depend on pics taken by friends because mine are just a blur.  I must admit that when the pics are focused they come out beautiful, but I would not recommend purchasing.  It is not reliable.  Also, make sure you have spare batteries with you - they drain pretty quickly.""
"20100803","2.0","You get what you pay for","I'm a very loyal Nikon fan and have been using their digital SLR cameras for years.  My 'bar' camera has always been a Canon, but I decided to try the Nikon Coolpix since I have always trusted Nikon's technology.The camera takes nice pictures and is a very good price for a 12 megapixel camera.  There is a large view screen, which is also a plus.However, there are two major downsides to the camera that I wish I would have known before purchasing:1) It uses AA batteries -- NOT a rechargeable battery pack.  This actually makes the camera more expensive in the long run, since you need to constantly purchase AA batteries.  It also makes the camera wider than battery-pack cameras since there has to be room for batteries.  Hence, a camera that doesn't fit in your pocket as well as other models2) After hitting the shutter button, it takes a LONG time for the camera to actually take the picture.  So being out at the bar, everyone has to wait a LONG time holding their smiles... almost uncomfortably long.  So this camera is not recommended for use at sporting events where you are trying to capture fast-action motion""

The L6 was a great little camera to have in your pocket or purse.  It took great photos.  The only bad thing - which was big - that I didn't like about that camera was the shutter lag on flash photos.  In spite of that, I liked the small size and very nice photos.  I purchased two more as gifts.  Unfortunately, I dropped mine and wanted to replace it. I purchased the L22 and took it to a wedding.  Out of 50 photos, I only have one nice one.

In June, we were going to my daughters graduation and brought along both cameras.  We used the Nikon before the ceremony and then placed it inside the camera bag and then inside the Canon camera bag (for ease of carrying).  The Canon camera bag is a large backpack style bag with padded individual compartments for the different lens...my point... the Nikon was really protected.  We pulled the camera out to shoot some photos after the ceremony and the LCD screen was blurry.  I sent the camera back to Nikon to fix and they stated the LCD screen is not covered under warranty.  It would be $85 to fix.  I am extremely displeased with the warranty as well as the product.  I know the camera was protected and did not get crushed or damaged by us as Nikon states.  I strongly recommend looking at another camera as well as another brand with a better warranty.""

"20100721","4.0","Good quality pictures from a basic camera","I needed a replacement camera, but didn't have a lot to spend, so this Nikon was my choice. I have had it for a month, and I have been very happy with the image quality, from inside to outdoors, and especially close-ups. The camera does not have a lot of complicated features, but the settings work well. I don't use the easy auto setting very much, because it doesn't usually pick the appropriate setting. But I have had good results with the automatic setting, and choosing my own scene mode like macro or sports. I often turn off the flash for better results, and the pictures do not get blurry like on my old camera. The zoom works very well, even after you go past the optical zoom and into digital. The only slight issue I have found is that it is sometimes slow to take the shot and save it so that you can take the next one. This seems to be a Coolpix thing, because my last one did it too. However, my final comment would be on how great the video quality is. I was impressed with both the sound and image quality of the few I've taken so far. If you are looking for an affordable basic digital camera, then I highly suggest the Coolpix L22.""

We have used this camera at some multiple-day music festivals and are simply amazed at the clarity of the pictures and how easy it is to use!  The sound on the videos is good (if your computer speakers are good) and a unipod solves the shake problem if you have one.  The batteries last pretty long if you aren't shooting videos - that seems to use them up quicker.  This is my first digital camera, and I bought it because 1) easy to use, 2) large preview screen and 3) uses AA batteries.  I was absolutely thrilled it did all this extra stuff.

It seemed HUGE compared to my tiny S203 and the pictures were always blurry.  It took extra seconds to switch from camera to movie and even to take a simple posed picture required 2.5 seconds of holding the button.  Not a chance you would ever catch a good candid shot.

For what I want, the Canon is much better.The Nikon isn't a bad camera, but it isn't what I want in a camera. There are not enough manual controls. You can see from a picture of the camera that it does not have the big button function selector on top. You are a slave to the Nikon menu's and they don't have nearly the number of choices that I want. There is no Program shooting mode, just Auto. Therefore it will not allow me to choose the ISO setting, which is improtant to me. Like most P&S cameras it does not have a viewfinder so you are left to hold the camera out one or two feet away from you to shoot the picture. I want a viewfinder to look through so that my head helps hold the camera steady, which is VERY improtant in taking a picture with any kind of camera. Some, but not all, of the Canon P&S cameras do have a viewfinder.If you can get past the limitations of auto selected ISO settings and can hold the camera steady, there is no problem with picture quality. My guess is that a lot of people who don't know as much as I do about digital cameras would love the simplicity of the L22, and the L22 is 40-50 bucks cheaper than most Canon P&S cameras so it just depends on what you want in a camera.""
"20100628","5.0","Nikon L22","Love this camera!It was difficult making a decision regarding cameras in this price range;  Canon, Olympus, Fuji, Samsung, Nikon, Kodak, Polariod, etc., etc., etc.All had 5 star ratings, and all had 1 star ratings.I based my decision on having had a old Nikon F1, and how much I enjoyed using it.So, I chose the Nikon, and I am glad that I did!I find this camera easy to use, and it takes excellent pictures.Keep in mind that I am a casual photographer, and that the pictures I am taking are for person use, as well as ebay/craigslist.The camera interfaces easily with my XP Pro, Vista, and Windows 7 desktops, and uploading is a breeze.I recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive, easy to use, quality digital camera.""

"20100622","5.0","Easy to use!","I love this camera! It's so simple to work. I used to own an older model of Canon and it stopped working within 4 years. Afterward, I start to look for a simple functioning camera. This is it! Everything is pretty much self explanatory. However, if you can't figure out certain functions then you can always turn to the manual. Also the pictures I took on my old camera looks much clearer with this Nikon camera.I recommend this camera for people who are looking for something simple and easy to use. I don't think it has any special features for advanced photographers who want to do creative things on the camera. But I personally love this camera. Also I would recommend the generic camera bag from Amazon as well. It's so cheap and fits the camera perfectly.""
"20111023","1.0","Cheap Plastic Battery Latch Broke","What good is a product if it breaks within a year? After less than a year of use... nothing major, the battery latch broke. The latch is made out of the same plastic the body is constructed with. I believe it was part of the same mold. Whatever the design, it broke, rendering the camera useless. I'm not sure why Nikon would design a battery latch made of cheap plastic. This is the one most important function in any electronic product. It opens and closes constantly and it's the power source to the device. Why would it be made of plastic!?!""
"20111021","1.0","Piece of Junk!","When I saw this camera on sale, I thought, 'Wow! What a bargain for only $79'! The store threw a case and a memory card with it. OK, that's great, saved me some money. But, however, when I took it home, I had a hard time opening the battery compartment. And this camera, Nikon Coolpix 22 eats batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner! They drain really fast. The original batteries lasted not even a month, then I bought replacements - I'm talking Duracell, not a cheap brand, and the batteries were exhausted, and I just bought them brand new! Right in the middle if taking pictures, the camera shut down, and and to turn it on again. Even my cellphone camera works better than this crap.The only good feature of this poor excuse of a camera is that it takes good pictures. I thought Nikon made good quality cameras, but I'm wrong. I think I will check out Canons or Olympus.""
"20111019","1.0","Junk","My first review for Amazon.  Anyway, this camera is junk.  Like other reviewers reported, the pictures taken are horrible-worse than a 'basic' cellphone camera.  The camera itself destroys pictures, with lines through some of the few pictures that are worth keeping, or cuts them off halfway.  It also makes 'collages' of a bunch of pictures.  What else doesn't it do?  It won't remember settings after it automatically goes to power saver mode.  It's slow to turn on and wake-up.  It makes a bunch of different Nikon 100 folders on the SDCard and distributes the pictures randomly.  It won't save some pictures, I've suspected that before but I now know there are a whole series of pictures just not there.  No way I'll ever get another chance to take those.Sorry Nikon, I'll never buy another product of yours.  Even though I expect perfection, or at least have the product live up to manufacturer claims; I very rarely post reviews.  This item is so bad that I have to.""

I gave this camera a low rating because I bought it in June and the battery door hook broke in July IN THE CAMERA CASE! It barely got bumped and now there is no way to keep the batteries in. I had it taped for a while but now I am getting error messages. Sad Sad day! Nikon!

I usually buy Canon, but you can't go wrong with Nikon. Right?I suppose it is worth what I paid for it, but I am very disappointed and will probably soon replace it.My main complaints..and they are big ones with me..are that the shutter response time is very, very long.  After seeing a friend's amusing vacation pictures where he took pictures of companions jumping in midair in front of tourist attractions, we tried to do it with this camera...IMPOSSIBLE!Even with practice you cannot anticipate the jump and catch the people in the air. Not that I care to do that much...It just illustrates the point.My other main complaint is that in moderately low light...not poorly lit, just moderately low, the auto focus is very inaccurate resulting in as many out of focus pictures as in focus ones.I do not recommend this camera.""
"20111003","4.0","good value for point and shoot","Other reviewers mentioned slow shutter speed, and this is a problem in lower light settings - contributing to lots of fuzy photos.  However, is not as noticeable on exterior or well lit interior shots, but probably not a good choice if you are looking to do lots of action pictures. Battery life is not great, but only needs 2 batteries at a time (last point and shoot I had used 4 batteries at a time, but lasted forever). Only has the view screen and that can drain battery life.  Other downside of this camera is requires nikon proprietary cable to connect to your computer vs. standard mini USB connector. Not very expensive to get one, but hassle to have multiple cables.""
"20110930","4.0","great camera","I have this camera and I am very happy with it. it has sports mode which is great because I love taking pictures of fast movement.It takes .92 seconds with flash, and 1.34 seconds with no flashthere is 18 picture modes and it also records 25 minutes of video. About 5 hours of battery life. (takes 2 double A batteries) the one thing thatI don't like is how long it takes to delete. I wouldn't worry about that though.""
"20110923","4.0","Nice camera at a nice price","My father always swore by his Nikon camera as it was the best. This model puts together some top end capabilities in a small price range, but it has a somewhat clunky and difficult to understand editing software (which I eventually gave up on and went back to my old standby Photoshop). Fortunately, it is very easy to save and import pictures so you can manipulate them in your choice of software, be it the software the comes with Windows, Apple, or something a little better like Photoshop.I don't especially recommend the included software package, as I found it less than helpful with things like cleaning up dark spots, moving small blemishes, and so on. It was also very unfriendly to a colorblind person.The camera will certainly require a good reading of the users manual as it is not quite a point and shoot, and certainly not intuitive. Than being said, in 20 minutes you can be up and running, and in 2 days, producing some pretty high quality shots with this camera. It has more than enough settings (probably too many in fact) to cover any occasion, and does quite well with a variety of distances.""

The time between shots was slower than slow. The video quality was not up to par, it went in and out of focus when I zoomed. None of the pictures I took were not blurry.

"20100510","2.0","Partially disappointed","Hubby and I were on vacation when our camera started to act up on us. We went to a chain store we trust and bought this camera based on the Nikon reputation, the fact that it takes AA batteries and uses the same storage media as the one we currently have. That night I checked out the different settings until I became comfortable changing them. While using it both hubby and I found we switched to pix review with our thumbs often. When we got home I downloaded the pix. We're happy with the ones taken close and on land, but, the ones taken on boats (we went on a couple of sailboats on vacation) and the ones taken at a distance I'm disappointed with. It seems like most of the boat pix are blurry; the seas weren't choppy. I don't think this will take good pix at our grandsons ball games, either.I'm now in the process of researching a camera with some type of stabilization feature and one with a longer optical zoom.""

I have talked to three people at Nikon and everyone tells me that there is no manual available.  If I have problems I should just call a CSR at Nikon and they will help me.  Can you imagine being on a cruise and having to call Nikon because you don't understand something?  I bought this camera for a special occasion and vacation and I have no owner's manual to take with me.  This makes no sense to me or anyone I have told about this problem.

I called Nikon and explained the problem, and they ensured me that my camera repair would be covered under the 1-year warranty.  I mailed the camera back per their instructions at a cost of $15.00.  Imagine my surprise when a week later I received a letter that said 'This repair is not covered under warranty.'  They were asking me to approve a cost of $104.72 to repair it, and had the nerve to say in the letter that they would charge me more for the repair service 'if the cost will exceed this estimate.'  The camera was worth that amount new, so why would I pay that amount for a camera that failed me?  This was my first Nikon camera, and it will be my last.  So much for Nikon customer service...  I also want to add that I talked with several people at work who had Nikon's with a similar problem, and said Nikon also told them this problem is not covered under warranty.

Full instructions are on a disk with quick reference details in a thin paper manual. Disk had excellent wide ranging information so take time to familiarize this before leaving unless you are taking a reader with you - I wasn't. Camera comes with a lead for connecting to a computer but you do need to buy a chip to record photos- camera will only record a few without one.

I kind of think that most 1 star people are negative and will find fault with any product.  Boy was I duped.  Yep, the camera seemed like a great little camera for about 9 months.  If I had given it a review right after purchase, it might have been 5 stars.  Then the battery compartment latch (made of cheap plastic) failed.  I went through all the hassle of shipping it back to Nikon at my own expense for what I thought would be a warrantied repair only to have them refuse to cover it under warranty, claiming that the camera was dropped or abused.  Luckily I had a Square Trade Warranty.  My extended warranty was honored with great customer service and little to no hassles, plus I received 5% more than my purchase price when the claim was settled.  So, back to Amazon I went to find another camera.  THEN I started reading the 1 star reviews for my L22 and L24.  And wala .... it seems this is an issue on all Nikon Coolpix cameras.  Cheap little plastic latch breaks and Nikon wants over $100 to repair the camera.  So buyer beware - take this into consideration before making your purchase.  Take the time to read some of those 1-2-3 star reviews to see just what problems may arise.  And - do yourself a favor and spend the extra $15 to get the extended warranty.  You won't be sorry.""
"20110803","2.0","Perfect camera surgeons or bomb squad members","This camera is subject to one fatal flaw.  The shutter speed is a back-breaker.  At first I thought it was just a matter of lighting and I could change the settings or mode to find something that would help.  After months of playing around with each adjustable setting and talking at length with Nikon customer support, I still am unhappy.  The pictures that are not blurry are good, nice contrast and minimal red-eye, but most times all I get are images that would give Salvador Dal&iacute; a headache.  It is a good size, lightweight, and has a user friendly menu system.  Be advised to avoid this camera.""
"20110728","1.0","Flawed, Do Not Buy","I got this camera 3 months ago. Soon, the battery door broke such that it would not stay closed. The plastic lock mechanism just broke off. I sent it back to Nikon to the tune of $10 postage only to be told it would cost me $119 to fix. They would not honor the 1 year warranty because it was possible I dropped it or misused it. I have seen other reviews on this unit complaining about the door and got it anyway. So for about 5 months, I got a nice disposable Nikon piece of **** that costs more to fix than buy. No more Nikon for me! You've been warned.""
"20110727","1.0","Very disappoint with Nikon product.","I have used Nikon for more than 20 years, from N65, D50 to D90, plus all the lens.  I purchased the L22 just for business travel and easy to carry.  It last for 6 months and the battery latch door broke.  I called and sent to Nikon repair center, oveall experience with the center was poor to ok, not very friendly probably it is in LA.The cost for the repairment (due to not cover by the warranty?  why?  only 6 months....they said due to user fault)?? was $68.50.  Must be kidding, I am very disappointed by Nikon and its service...It takes years to build the reputation, but takes days to destroy.......""
"20110726","5.0","Easy to use","The Nikon L22 replaced an older Olympus - no viewing screen, just a viewfinder.  While the Olly was a 'Better' engineered camera, I never mastered all its functions.  The Nikon is so easy - I have a hunch it does as much as the Olly, just more user friendly.  With the speed electronics update today.....I see no use to spend more $ than I did.  I'm not a professional photographer and the Nikon takes beautiful pix and I'm not out to impress anyone.""
"20110725","3.0","sometimes, camera is completely worthless","The main problem I have with the camera is that it is utterly worthless when taking a picture of something up close. The icon for this picture mode is two flowers, which were impossible to find. I didn't even think it had one at first. When I tried to use it, the camera's auto focus will almost always focus on the background. Automatically. Otherwise this camera is fine. just don't try to photograph anything less than a foot away.""
"20110724","4.0","Pretty cool camera","I love this camera for daily use, takes much better pictures than my camera phone. The 12 Megapixel rating will give you great pictures. It has a pretty easy to figure out navigation system and you can easy figure out what you can't on your own if you read the instruction manual. The battery life is decent, but as with all cameras you will want to get an extra. I have used this on my vacation to miami and had great results.""

I love photography in general and this camera is so compact and takes awesome pictures !Take care,Zachery""
"20110721","2.0","Not as good as it looks","Lots of Mega but the quality actually goes down with the higher resolution. It has difficulty when there is a high contrast change in the pic. If very sunny and also have shade in the same pic, they both loose quality, the sunny will show glare, and the darker will loose detail.What I like, it's large size screen, it's video ability, and it's a nice looking camera.  Take a lot of pictures, and discard many of them. This is not a reliable point and shoot camera, so just keep shooting. I got mine used, it took a very long time for delivery, longer than promised, and it didn't include the usb cable. Not that it mention that it did, but I would have expected to mention that it didn't.I got it for around $53.00 including tax and shipping. I wish I had gotten a new olympus for the same price.But having said al that, not a bad camera for $53.00""

"20110717","4.0","Niikon","I am kind of rough on cameras so I dont like to spend too much on them.Just got back from vacation and downloaded the pictures from my Nikon.The pictures are excellent for a cheap camera.""
"20110715","2.0","Poor design on battery door","I have had the camera for a few months and had been generally happy - picture quality was good and it was easy to use.  Just recently the battery door started popping open whenever I tried to use the camera.  There is nothing obvious that is broken, but the door simply will not stay latched.  Researching possible solutions on the internet indicates lots of Nikon owners are having problems with the battery door.  I naturally can't recommend this camera.""
"20110714","1.0","You get what you pay for...","We originally purchased the Nikon Coolpix L22 for our son's birthday present.  I purchased it over the Thanksgiving day weekend, even though his birthday isn't until February.  Amazon did a great job.  The camera arrived in just a couple days.  Love that super saver shipping.  I just packed the box up into our closet to wait until the birthday party.Fast Forward 3 months.  We're in the middle of a 12 year old's birthday party...  and he wants to try out his new camera.  We took it out of the box and...  the battery latch is defective and completely broken off..  It won't hold the batteries in no matter what we try.  I then called support, explained my issue and pay to send it to them.  About 2 weeks later I get an invoice in the mail telling me if I want my camera fixed I have to pay 70$  That was almost what we paid for the camera NEW!I had them send the camera back to us.  I was very disappointed.  After doing many more web searches I have found that this issue is very common in the 'Coolpix' line of cameras.(In fact google 'battery door latch' and the first result is about a Nikon Coolpix...  many of the following results are as well)Now on to the technical side.  Once I got the camera back I used some electrical tape and taped the battery latch door shut so that I could do some side by side comparison's.Compared to my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS3 8.1 Megapixel it fell short in every test I made with it.  Low light shots where blurry, there was a significant amount of noise in the images, and the colors appeared dull in comparison.  The video was dull and quite grainy.  The sound quality on the video was low and tinny.  The only bright spot on the camera was the menu's were easy to navigate and simple to operate.  On the Nikon the on/off was a push button and took over 2 seconds to power up, and to actually focus and take a 'good' picture in 'easy mode' it was more like 5 - 7 seconds.(fastest = 5, slowest = 10)  The Panasonic on the other hand has an on/off slider and was taking 3 - 4 seconds for a power-up shot.  In the size department the L22 is pretty large for a 'point and shoot' it was much larger than the Panasonic.  For Menu's between the two.  I liked the layout of the Nikon.  At first glance it was easy to setup 'favorite modes' so you could easily switch your camera between Auto, Easy Auto, Video, and 1 preset mode.  But in function it was very slow.  You'd push the button and nothing would happen.  Press it a second time and watch the menu's flash up, then down again.  It just wasn't very fast.  The Panasonic took a bit more work getting the presets enabled, but it was very quick.Over all, based on it's performance I'd give it a rating of 2.  Based on the poorly designed battery latch, and the poor reception we received from Nikon support...  I will be giving this product a 0.  And I doubt I will be purchasing another Nikon.""
"20110713","1.0","Not reliable","I had this camera for a little more than a year. After a year and one month it broke. The focus stopped working, either auto or manual. If you consider buying this camera be prepared to through it in the garbage soon or pay for ridiculously expensive extended warranty. Strictly not recommend.""
"20110712","5.0","nice camera","I would highly recommend this camera. This camera is the perfect size for my purse. I can carry it where ever I go. It is easy to carry around and user friendly. I use it mostly to take picture of flowers. The pictures came out beautiful.""

"20110709","2.0","Warranty Issues","We bought this camera in Sept 2010.  Like the camera, takes great pics.  However, the battery door won't stay closed.  Returned camera to Nikon for warranty repair. They insist camera was dropped (never, always in case when not in use) or battery door forcibly opened causing it to break. (how??) They told me warranty only covers camera if it doesn't work when it is taken out of the box.  It does not cover issues that arise after camera has been used. Anyway, they want $56 to repair battery door and $20 tax, shipping, handling for a total of $76 to repair a $90 camera.  If you buy this camera, be VERY CAREFUL with it because Nikon will not repair under warranty.""
"20110705","4.0","Pleased with this purchase","After researching digital cameras, I purchased the Coolpix because of what I had read.  It is a great little camera.  The delivery time was good and the camera came with it's original owner's manual, etc.  It was a great purchase for me!""

The longevity of this camera should be more than 6months, she didn't even use it that much.  I would not recommend this product due to the fact it's unpredictable and non-fixable.""
"20110628","1.0","Not satisfied at all!","I ordered this camera for my mom for Christmas last year. Already having problems with it! It drains the batteries, even when they are taken out and put in the camera right before getting ready to use it, she is only able to take about 20 pictures and then it says the batteries are exhausted. Also have problems with the pictures it takes. They turn out yellow and blurry. The camera is only able to be returned through Amazon for 30 days, so now we either have to contact the manufacturer or be out $90. Not my idea of a good purchase!""
"20110625","1.0","Buy at your own risk","I bought this camera for my son in June of 2010, just about 13 months ago. I own multiple Digital SLRs, but this was for he and his mother to use periodically. The camera was taken to a Boy Scouting trip, on a school trip to Philadelphia, and to a few elementary school events. I'm guessing the camera has taken 250-500 pictures in total.The zoom no longer works. It simply stopped. The cost to repair is greater than the cost of the camera. Now the camera itself still works fine, we can take pictures, but the ability to use the 3.6X zoom is gone. I've tried countless internet suggestions/fixes to no avail.Google search 'Nikon Coolpix known issues' - lens errors are super common and happen frequently. The # of 'out of the box' lens issues is a bit scary.As far as pocket/purse digitals go, this is the worst we've owned (this is our 4th). I had a lot of hope for it. From a form factor perspective, it was perfect and looked great. But it does a terrible job re: image quality and we end up with an inordinate amount of blurred photos compared to our others.Anyway, buyer beware. I'm on my 3rd SLR, 2nd digital (one an 18MP version). While I'm no professional, I know enough about digital cameras to say this one is shoddy at best.""
"20110625","5.0","Great camera","I bought this camera for my 60 year old mother hoping it would prove easy to use and non-intimidating. It was perfect for her. She loved the look of it, how small it is and the large viewing screen. She was able to load the software and start using it immediately without any reference to the user manuals. Picture quality was great, too. Haven't gotten into the more advanced features but for an entry level introduction to digital photography this is a great choice.""
