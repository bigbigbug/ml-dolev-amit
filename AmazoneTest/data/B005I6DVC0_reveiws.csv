"20120612","5.0","Very pleased!!!","This is a great, easy carrying camera. Zoom is very good for a camera it's size. Took it to Disney World, Cocoa Beach and Universal Studios in June and it did everything I wanted from a new camera. It takes AA batteries (I used regular Energizer batteries) and I could take hundred pics or so before I needed to change them out. I did not take any video so I'm not sure how long the batteries will last in that mode. Very easy to manuver around in the camera and it's functions. The flash does not pop up automatically when 'needed', yet I found that I liked it this way. I am not a technical sort of person so I can't go into a bunch of details of all the functions. I LIKE TO POINT AND SHOOT AND GET GOOD PICS!!!! This camera will do waaaay more than I probably will ever use. I am very pleased with my new Cannon!!!!!!!""

"20120603","5.0","About 100 pictures per battery, 9/10 picture quality","This is a heck of a camera for $149!  It takes great pictures (not DSLR quality, but pretty great otherwise), fast, and has an incredible zoom.Two sets of Duracell batteries took right about 200 pictures and 6 videos.  So about 100 pictures and 3 videos each set before running out.Considering you pay about $200 less for the same camera with rechargeable batteries (and then I always buy a second/backup battery, for another $60 or so), I am just fine buying batteries.  This way I'll never run out, not like there are many places you can't find AA batteries.The only thing to note is that unlike other Canons, the flash does NOT pop up.  The camera's screen blinks with something saying you should pop the flash up if it thinks you need it.  Not doing so, is your way of forcing the camera to adjust and take the picture with current lighting (equivalent of changing flash settings on other Canons to turn off flash).ps.  Video has 2 settings, 1280x720 is the high/max resolution.  At this resolution it takes about 9 minutes of video then stops (all digital cameras seem to have a max video size which equates to # of minutes).""
"20120601","1.0","ZERO Battery Life--15-20 Minutes Before Change!","I was so excited about the features of my new camera and I LOVED it.... for the 15 minutes my batteries lasted.  I figured something was wrong with my batteries, so I grabbed some new ones of a better brand.  20 minutes later, batteries were dead.  I tried a third set of AAs, rechargeables this time, and the battery lasted me 20 minutes once more.  Upon some deeper research, looks like this is a problem with the SX150 and I did not just get a lemon.Unless you feel like carrying around 10 sets of extra batteries, don't even THINK about buying this camera.  And heaven forbid you are traveling.  Your options will be lugging an extra 5 pounds of batteries everywhere you go OR missing all of the pictures you want to take.Canon, this is really unacceptable.""

Normal AA battery has a very short life, were as these days all latest brands Cameras came in latest charging system.Please issue this problem other wise I want to return this device.""
"20120527","5.0","Good for the money","Had the camera a few days and giving it good marks, especially for picture quality.  I especially bought this camera for two main reasons. I wanted one with a decent mega-pixel rating and also a good OPTICAL zoom.  This camera has both.  The operation is not intuitive so I did have to do some homework but much of it was 'easy' to operate but I wonder if part of that is because I've owned a digital camera before this one.And to address other's statements that the camera doesn't have an 'automatic' flash---big deal, does not bother me one bit to physically lift the flash protector----takes less than a second.  And the other issue of using batteries up quickly----not a big problem with me either.  I already had 4 rechargeable AA batteries and just bought four more.  (HINT: If buying rechargeable batteries, buy ones of a different brand from one another so you will not mix the used ones with the fresh)  Considering the camera only holds two batteries, quick usage can be expected. I just carry my spares in my camera bag.One thing does bother me a little and that is the fact that it is 'slippery'.  There is no textured or rubberized plastic on which to grip the camera and keep a good grasp.  I think I may just get in the habit of putting the wrist strap around my wrist and spinning it a few times to tighten. The camera would be better to have two places on which to attach a strap that you could put around your neck.And I'm not sure about the quality of the Macro function with this camera. (Took me a while to realize that option is not available in the Auto mode.)  Don't know if the detail is questionable because when I open the photos in my Cannon software, I can magnify the view so many times that eventually it appears poor.  So that's a relative observation, at best.  But the movie quality is very good, especially when using the zoom.  I don't bother with the digital zoom but even that didn't look bad.  Need to get a tripod to hold the camera steady when zooming during a movie!  (Or maybe a 'mono-pod')?One thing I found lacking in the Cannon down-loadable Zoombrowser EX software was the inability to downsize photos, and I miss my Photoshop ability to warm the photo with its 'Temperature' option. Haven't looked deep enough for a way to warm a photo through Cannon's camera software so forgive me.  But you have the option of setting the camera to take lower resolution photos, so you can email them easier.  However, I've found that the quality isn't as good as when I take the photo in full resolution, edit it in other software and downsize it, to send it in an email attachment.One GREAT feature is the on-screen 'notes' explaining what the different settings do, while choosing different settings on the camera!  It's a quick summary of the function without having to refer to an manual.Others mentioned the speed at which the camera takes photos too.  Again, doesn't bother me at all because I don't find myself in a position of having to take multiple photos in a row. But I also find that the on/off button is being accidentally hit when taking the camera out of my camera case.  It would be better to have that more recessed so you wouldn't turn the power on by mistake.Overall, for the price, this is a pretty good deal and you also have the Cannon name and quality behind you.  I'd recommend to a friend.""

Hooked up the cable.  No problem.  Tried to transfer the pictures to the computer.  Big problem.  It crashed my Windows XP computer and caused a serious error. I rebooted the computer and tried again.  It crashed again when trying to transfer the pictures. This is on a reliable computer for which crashing is extremely rare.

I'm very happy with this purchase because I think you can not find a digital camera better than this one at such a great price. What I like the most about this camera, is that you can take your pics using a few other options in addition to the fully automatic mode; just as the very expensive cameras can do it, so that you can control the camera to do what you want it to do.This was a great buy and I recommend this product to everybody!""

Do not buy unless you plan on carrying extra batteries with you.""
"20111228","4.0","Great point and shoot camera!","For a point and shoot camera this takes amazing photos. I'm not a professional photographer by any means, just a high school student who loves photography and needed to be on a budget for a new camera. The effects are great, it's easy to hold, not too heavy, and takes nice photos. The only cons I have are that the flash sometimes takes a little while to charge, the HD photos take up a lot of memory space (so buy a memory card with a lot of space), and it's AA battery powered, which can be costly, but if you buy rechargeable batteries (which most electronic stores as well as target sell) it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Great buy!""
"20111228","4.0","A point and shoot with a big camera feel","Pro:Still small enough for a pocket or purse but looks like a bigger camera with the lens extended.  Very good photo quality compared to other instant 'point and shoot' digital 'small' cameras.Uses cheep SD cards instead of some expensive variation.Creates good photos inside and out with very little in the way of training or camera savvy knowledge.Competitive priceCon:Slow to charge Flash, est. 15 sec. after I flipped up the flash hood.  I understand that it may be under powered and eat up AA batteries.  But they are cheep.  Used it for over an hour on the weekend.  Still same batteries so far but based on the flash I would guess they won't last.""

"20111227","5.0","I love it!","I did a lot of research before deciding to purchase this camera. When it came down to it, I ended up buying this one because it was in my price-range and had amazing zoom capabilities. The camera I owned previously had a 3x zoom, and 7MP, and was still a battery hog. So let's just say that I am VERY grateful for this upgrade! The pictures are crisp. The zoom is incredible. And, compared to my old camera, it takes the shots right when I want it to! (I don't have to wait a few seconds for the picture to take after I press the button.) People say that it eats batteries, but they must be spoiled!!! I can take at least twice as many pictures on the Canon SX150 IS before the batteries die than I could on my old camera.

"20111227","4.0","Good Camera But Keep Extra Batteries Handy","I received the Canon Powershot SX150 as a gift for Christmas this year. So I've had around two full days to use my camera and get accustomed to it at this point. I came to this camera as a nice step up from my previous cameras I've owned. Not counting this, I've owned three separate cameras since 2000. A 3 megapixel Vivitar, and a 7.1 and 8.2 Kodak Easyshare. So this camera felt like a nice step up for someone who isn't a professional photographer.That said, I'll start with the one con I have definitely noticed so far and has been very present in the two days I've had it. It just so happened this is something that seems to have been a relatively common mention in reviews--battery life.It's certainly a good camera but the battery life leaves something to be desired. As mentioned, this was a Christmas present from my parents. We open our gifts on Christmas eve. The batters that came included were used up that same night a handful of pictures and a quick video later. Fortunately, I have a relative who can get me batteries for free so I used two I had.Just this morning that I'm writing this review, the low battery signal appeared again. Again it came when I started recording a video. It almost seems to be the video that is a big user in draining the batteries.If you plan on buying this camera, I'd say it would be a good idea to always have extra batteries on hand. Better yet, set yourself up in a position to recharge your batteries when needed.So far, that is my one complaint. The camera, at 14.1 MPs, does take some pretty decent pictures. I'm not disappointed at all there. The camera isn't too bulky like some cameras so it can be pretty easily carried around in your pocket. The camera itself is also relatively simple to learn how to use and what does what. I had no problems learning how to operate it and to do what I need to do with it.With the flash, it's kind of unique among cameras I've owned. On this camera, to use the flash (or get it ready), you manually have to lift it up from the front of the camera. This is neither good nor bad for me. Just the first camera I've ever owned to be done like that.The only reason I don't 'love' this camera instead and only gave it four stars is the battery issue above.Bottom Line:-Takes good pictures-Easy to learn to use-Fair to perhaps slightly poor battery life but good camera otherwise-If without, buying rechargeable batteries and a charger would be a good decisionUPDATE (5/23/2012):At this point, I've owned this camera for almost five full months. Recently I purchased a set of rechargeable Energizer batteries with a charger that are high powered (2000) mAh batteries. As it turns out, many people suggest getting these for this camera. I didn't know that beforehand but I wanted to point out these batteries so far have worked great. I would highly recommend getting them in conjunction with this camera.""
"20111227","4.0","Great Camera, battery hog, wish more was in box","Great camera. 12x Optical zoom is fantastic. Easy to use. Used on Safari in India and was able to capture crisp vivid images at great distances.Eats batteries though. Don't waste your time with Alkaline batteries, they won't even last a day. Shooting video or using a flash caused false 'low battery' indications with my lithium batteries making me think they were about dead. Spent part of a trip abroad frantically trying to locate lithium batteries, when it turns out that the battery indicator was a false alarm. Using a flash does eat the battery life, though, be warned!Also: no SD card in the box, and no cable to connect camera to TV. Uses a different AV cable than my old powershot, so I couldn't show my pictures on the TV. Very poor decision on Canon's part. Having to buy the cable and card sucks and makes what is a reasonably priced camera more expensive. Local dealers don't stock the cable, which is even more frustrating.Video is shot in Quicktime .MOV format, which couldn't be imported into Windows Moviemaker. I am still working on this. Perhaps I missed something somewhere.....Overall I love the camera, it just seems like Canon has made things harder than they need to be.""
"20111227","4.0","Good basic camera with manual controls & optical zoom","Overall: good camera for the price.  Good value.  Lots of neat features (plus manual control) and great optical zoom.Pros: Lots of nice art features and scene presets.  Manual controls are really great for 'artsy' shots. The shutter can stay open for up to 15 seconds, great for night sillhouettes of trees. Time lapse shutter needs a tripod.  Shoots great outdoor shots in full light. Focuses quickly. Great optical (real) zoom level and stable at max zoom. Manual focus lets you decide what the focal plane is (we did this with chrystals with good results) - sometimes nothing beats the human eye.Cons: Lowlight seems a bit noisy. No viewfinder, just an LCD, so it's sometimes hard in full light. It's easy to get caught up in all the settings, but they are there, so that's good (note that it has an easy setting to fall back on). Canon layout takes a little getting used to.Flash charge takes a couple seconds.No issues with batteries - using $13.00 energizer 2000mAH set of 4 with charger - life and time used seems fine - 80 pictures or so.Using a class 10 sandisk memory card, no issues.Originally, we were looking at the elph 300 and chose this because of the optical zoom and manual controls.  If you don't need the zoom or manual stuff, then the elph might be a good alternative to this.  I think of this camera as a 'point & shoot +'.""
"20111227","4.0","Value for Money really good","The value for money is really important, and this camera is cheap in relationship with its functionality! The only 'defect' I found is that sometimes, the Flash takes too long to charge and to be able to take another photo.""
"20111226","1.0","Don't waste your money","This camera is not what I thought it was going to be. The shutter speed is VERY slow. By the time the picture actually takes it's not what you were looking at on the screen UNLESS the subject is posed very still.

This is not what I wanted in a camera and am actually in the process of returning it.""

That's not in our budget and it just isn't handy to have to switch out batteries in the midst of doing life and trying to capture it.

"20111220","1.0","Great features in theory but impossible to use.","I almost gave it two stars, but if you cannot use a camera and send it back (and have said 'I hate this camera' several times), then it only gets one star.  Batteries (brand new rechargeable eneloop batteries) got chewed up with moderate use.  Really, if you went somewhere you might take a lot of pictures over a full day, you might need two sets of backup batteries.  Half the time when you want to snap a picture at night, the camera isn't ready because it says 'flash charging.'  My other cameras never did that -- and two of them have been Cannons.  Also the camera was way too bulky.  And, if you use any mode other than 'Auto,' it will not give you the option of any auto-review of the picture you just took.  You have to manually call it up.  Maybe there was a way to change this setting (it was dimmed in my options), but I never found it, and I didn't try very hard when I decided the rest of the issues made the camera not for me.""
"20111219","5.0","So far so good!","I just received my camera a few days ago, but I had a family christmas party over the weekend and was able to play with it. So far I love it. The pictures look so much clearer than my old sony point and shoot camera I've used for the last few years. It focuses much better and I haven't had any trouble so far with the lighting. Flash works great. I've just kept it on the easy mode so far, which adjusts everything automatically. I haven't played with the manual settings yet. I'm very happy with my purchase. I took a short video just to try it out and it seems very easy to use and the picture was nice and clear. The low battery light came on pretty quickly so I agree with the other reviews that the battery life for this camera won't be good.

It was completely intact minus the LCD screen).  This wasn't one of the cameras on my list when I went to a store to see & try out the various cameras I was going to choose from.  I saw this and fell in love.  I was looking for a decently easy-to-use point and shoot camera with a good zoom and my price limit was $200.  This delivered in every way - not to mention all the extra fun scenes and effects.  I like the fact that it uses AA batteries because then I can just have a decently inexpensive backup - and if I lose them or forget them, I can go to any store and get my camera working without having to wait for it to charge.  My last camera used AAs as well, so I had some extra lithium batteries.  I might try rechargeable batteries once my lithium batteries are used up since other reviewers have mentioned they work really well.""
"20111212","4.0","Not perfect but pretty good","I owned a previous version of the PowerShot. When I upgraded, there was no other choice for me.The picture quality is very good. I take a lot of pictures at athletic events and this camera does a fairly nice job with even high speed events - somebody charging down the court for instance. With my old PowerShot I probably had 1 in 5 I deleted, which I expected. I didn't pay for a multi-hundred dollar camera with the ability to zoom in on the flea on my dogs back then and I didn't this time either. Now, I probably get 1 bad picture in 25 as far as action shots. No gripes. Regular posed photos, excellent. Although, I will say the flash sometimes has a mind of its own which can be frustrating. The zoom is excellent, much better then the old line in terms of magnification capability and still taking a good shot.Download/transfer was made even more simple. Before I would have had to have the Canon interface installed on my PC, now it just transfers automatically. Hooray! I'd like to believe that's why this camera is a bit bigger as they added capability.And as I see many people have been talking about batteries, I have had no such problems. Battery life is, with my rechargeables, as good as it was before. 100-125 shots minimum.What I will tell you, is so obvious, do your homework! If you want to see the flea circus from 100 yards, then buy a camera that can do that. Also, find the battery solution that works for you. I like being able to slide two double A's in. Some people want the professional battery pack. It's really a matter of preference.Rating: B+, A- if the flash didn't have a mind of its own.""

I love the zoom as it refocuses great during zoom and the picture quality has been very solid.  Only drawback is having to remember to lift the flash but that, I can live with.  It's a bit hard on batteries too but with rechargeable that's a non-issue.Overall I think it's a really great camera from a great camera company for the money!""

"20111208","5.0","Amazing Camera!","I got this camera at an amazing price on Black Friday and I couldn't be happier. Before this camera I had another canon camera, the Powershot A610, which was a great camera but after so many years with it, I wanted a little more without having to spend more than 200 dollars.The tryout: I have been trying the SX150is under different conditions: Under lots of sunlight, at night, taking pictures from my car, with my dogs, cloudy days and so far the pictures have been amazing. I haven't had any problems using the 3 inch screen under very sunny days. The zoom of this camera is lots of fun, especially on video mode, I was in a race track the other day and it was cool to use it to not miss any part of the action, even when the cars were far away on the other side of the track. Yes, it's true that it is a little bulky, you might not be able to slide it inside your jeans pockets but, just like somebody wrote, that's where your cellphone should go, not your camera. It's easy to use with just one hand while your other hand has a soda or a beer, so no need to worry that you will miss enjoying the food and drinks at the BBQ because you decided to take pictures.The Flash: Before getting the camera I was kinda worried about it, since you gotta be pulling it up if you want to use it. The truth is that once I got my camera and started taking pictures I didn't feel that was a problem, the camera lets you know if you need flash, although there are sooo many ways to take great pictures with this camera without even thinking of using the flash. Taking pictures at night is awesome, I haven't seen cameras on this price range taking pictures in low light with the quality that this camera gives you. The flash does take a little bit to load, but it is not a big problem for me, it's not like you have to sit or make people hold a smile for  30 seconds so that you can take a picture with flash.I have read some complaints about battery issues but, that shouldn't be a problem if you buy good rechargeable batteries. I got for this camera four (4) 3100 mAh rechargeable batteries and it's a whole big difference when you compare them with what alkaline batteries or lithium batteries can give you. The fun part is that, in case your rechargeable batteries run dry, you can always get some AA anywhere you are and keep having fun with your camera until you can recharge them again, so my advice is that if you have this camera and you don't want to be one of those people giving crappy scores to this camera just because they are too hard headed to keep feeding this camera with normal batteries, spend a little over 10 dollars in batteries as the ones I got, I spent a whole afternoon taking pictures and videos with these batteries without having to recharge them.To make this short, if you want the best camera that money can buy for less than 200 dollars, this is it. No other camera will give you the quality or the features that this one has. I'm very happy with what this camera offers, it has been way more than what I expected. You won't regret it and remember: BUY GOOD RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES!! It's just silly to keep seeing people writing complaints about using this camera with normal batteries of little capacity.""
"20111206","5.0","Dependable with multiple capabilities.","Had a Canon Powershot SX120 IS 10MP before and totally loved it.  After moisture damage I had to replace it.  Tried some other brand cameras and none really compared to the dependability and capabilities of the Canon SX120 IS 10 MP.  After returning a couple of other brand cameras decided to purchase the latest Canon Powershot SX150 14.1 MP.  I am loving the dependability of this camera too.  Takes clear shots. Has many many settings to choose from.  You can go all auto or make your own manual changes.  Love the video.  For a little hand held camera it has great video performance.  The button features of my previous model are very similar with this one so I didn't have to learn too many new button features.  Although this one has a few more fun features to play with as a bonus.  The size of the camera is perfect.  Very small for the features it has.  You can carry it in your purse or small camera bag. Other reviews complain about batteries.  That is nonsense!  If all you can complain on a camera is its battery usage and all of its capabilities are great then why not buy it.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the great pictures you can get. Totally recommend this camera.""
"20111206","5.0","I think I'm in love!","I've been a Canon user for 5 years now. My first digital camera was a Canon A430, then a couple of years later I upgraded to a Canon A480. Now I moved away from the A series to this SX because I was looking for a camera that featured a great zoom.I did look elsewhere, but ended up with Canon again. The features on this camera are unbelievable considering its price tag. And the zoom itself is awesome! The optical zoom is flawless and the digital zoom (48X) is pretty good as well. There's nothing quite like it on the market with this price. Price's bound to climb up soon!The only thing people seem to complain about on this camera is battery life. Well, I was aware of that when I bought it so I invested $20 more dollars on the Eneloop rechargeable batteries (with sanyo charger included) and I've had no problems at all. Batteries last just as much as they had lasted with my old Canon cameras.I'm very happy with the camera!""
"20111205","2.0","Disappointed","After the lens cover breaking on my Kodak easyshare, I was looking for a straightforward point and shoot digital camera with higher pixels and zoom. While I was happy with the quality of photos this camera could take, I was not at all pleased with the functionality of it. The camera itself is a bit bulky, which may turn some people off. Secondly, the camera takes awhile to power up - which annoyed me right off the bat. Once on, the menus are not very intuitive. There is too much scrolling through multiple menus. I imagine that with practice, it would be easy to navigate, but it certainly isn't straight out of the box. Lastly, and most disappointing for me was the flash situation. The flash didn't fire automatically in auto mode. Instead, there is a message on the screen 'Raise the flash' which prompts you to manually raise the flash cover. So, ok, I thought, just keep the flash up at all times. Unfortunately, after firing the flash takes several seconds to charge. This makes it very difficult and frustrating to take consecutive shots that require a flash. With kids, those moments don't always wait for the flash to be ready. While the camera may take nice pictures, it just seems slow and not user-friendly. As much as I was excited to receive this camera, I sadly had to return it in search of a quicker more adaptable replacement.""
"20111204","4.0","Excellent camera for the price","I have bought this camera recently and this light weight camera has surprised me with the quality of pictures. I did knew before buying this that the shutter speed is a bit slower compared to others but the price is unbeatable for such a camera. I also have a cybershot from sony and this fares better than that for sure. I m not a technical guy who would explore all possible pros and cons but would definitely need quality pictures and should fit my budget.Great buy it is!!. Amazon should make sure prices dont fluctuate so heavily else people would start buying it from stores like walmart where its easy to return and buy the same product at a lesser price. Returns with amazon include shipping which is not worth teh pain of packaging and returning when there is a price drop of 20-25 dollars. I got it close to the lowest though but feel sorry for those who had to buy it at 180 $ and hav to see it fall till 145. I myself have cancelled this item before i bought it again at a lesser price. But my buying experience was like catching a falling stock in stock market.Buy - cancel - wait for fall - wait if it falls more - buy again - but still wonder if it will fall more. I dont want my shopping to be anxious.""

Uses batteries like no tomorrow is the only drawback so far.  I like the bulk of the camera because it has the feel of a SLR.  The 3' LCD makes up for the lack of a viewfinder, but I haven't tested it out fully yet to see if being out in the bright sun will affect the view of the subject.  My previous Canon camera had both the viewfinder and a smaller LCD so I kind of miss that feature.  You also have to physically lift up the flash in order to use it, but the camera tells you if a flash is needed.  Overall a great digital camera.""

The camera automatically adjusted the lighting.  (I didn't know of this until I uploaded the pictures).  The dealbreaker for me was this: my batteries died after about 50 minutes of use.  Also, the flash isn't automatic; which can be inconvenient at times.On another occasion, I was at a Choral concert, I was able to use the 'discreet' mode, so there were no sounds and such.  After about 20 minutes of taking video, my camera died.Overall, the camera takes good pictures & video but there's no consistency to the quality.  Also, battery life is almost nonexistent.  I'm disappointed.  I'll be returning this product very soon.""

"20111125","1.0","Eats batteries","The camera sounded like a great deal, so I bought it from Wal-Mart so that I could get a warranty on it. The pictures weren't as clear as I expected and the LCD screen was fuzzy before taking pictures. Despite this, I thought, 'oh well that's not so bad, it's still a great camera for the price.'After the batteries that came with the camera died, I read the manual to see what types you could use with the camera. They said not to use rechargeable batteries and to use lithium or alkaline. I tried alkaline. I took maybe 10 pictures all together then set it on the shelf. I went to use it the next day and it said that my batteries were low. I thought, 'no way they can already be dead. I've hardly used the camera.' The batteries were completely dead and useless. I tried lithium batteries and got the same results. I called Canon because I figured I just got a bad one.They wanted me to mall it to them for $25 and they'd mail it back after they tinkered with it. Instead of going through all that hassle, I brought it back to Wal-Mart and got a full refund.It would be a good camera for the price if you can afford to buy millions of dollars worth of batteries to be able to take 50 pictures. Otherwise, this camera's not for you.""

The camera sold me after a careful consideration of its capabilities, but one aspect eluded me prior to buying - the battery life. I mostly wanted it for taking pics of the kids, and 2 brand new Energizer Lithium AA batteries are good for only 20 pictures or so. It could not handle my son's baseball game time of 2 hours for sure. I'm guessing I took about 20 pics and 3 videos of about 2 minutes each. By way of contrast, my still working Nikon L18 lasted almost an entire baseball season with 2 of the Energizer Lithium AA batteries !! January to June - 2 batteries. This camera - 6 innings and toast.Yes, it takes good pics, but I missed some good shots because I never considered the camera would smoke AA batteries so quickly.I think the camera's processor works is the culprit.Good Luck and bring lots of batteries.""
"20111118","4.0","Love This Camera!","This is a perfect camera for an alternative to lugging around a bulky DSLR. It has some options that a DSRL has and still has easy mode and auto mode. I think this camera is perfect for anyone. The only reason it didn't get all 5 stars because like others have said the battery life is pretty bad with regular batteries and you really do need lithium or a good rechargeable set, But i love that it takes AA batteries because your battery can die and AAs are available everywhere. also the flash sometimes does take what feels like forever sometimes to charge (its a few seconds). other than that, its a great buy.""
"20111116","4.0","Happy","I took a risk buying this camera because no reviews had been written yet.  My Canon PowerShot SD1400 IS broke and I needed a replacement very quickly for Photography class.  I knew that I wanted a Canon camera because of the Color Accent feature which I really enjoy.  I also wanted better zoom because my previous camera only had 4X optical zoom.  I didn't want to spend over $250 either.  I found this camera very fast and instantly took a liking to it.  I ordered it from Amazon with one day shipping and recieved it the day after.  I was very pleased with the model and loved having a better lens and zoom.  You can control the Aperture Priotity and Shutter Priority too.  It has a lot of great features my old camera did not.  The only problem I have is the battery life.  I have never tested how long the AA batteries last, but I have noticed it's a relatively short time.  Maybe an hour or so? My suggestion for that it getting a rechargeable battery package so you always have fully juiced batteries in the camera and several charging at the same time.  I have not done this yet but plan on it because I am going through batteries way to quickly.  Luckily it is an easy problem that can be solved.  All in all, I am very happy with this camera and love it to pieces!  It can take very high quality photos!""
"20111114","4.0","Perfect Fill in for the Price","Well, first I have to say I am so bloody tired of people buying products and expecting batteries to last for 'ever'--and if you are NOT using ones made directly for digital or rechargeable NiMH--you need to get some fast. Stop with the battery whining!!!!! Get the best rechargeables you can afford and if you are using all the 'stuff' a camera or other piece of equipment has to offer--get ready to replace them.I have to say, I did a lot of research, and this camera kept coming up and it fit in my current price range/budget. Next, I am impressed with the abilities that this camera has to offer. Nikon and Olmpus also offer cameras similar to this one--and have some of the same problems, functions (lack of), etc. Compare well--for me--it ended up being price. Research well before you purchase and in addition to price, KNOW how you are going to use the camera and its functions so that you do not get disappointment instead of having fun.This is my first Canon (I love Olympus and Nikon) and I am very pleasantly surprised by this camera and its abilities. They are far beyond what I expected and I could not be happier. I will update as I push this camera to its edges.Update December 2011: Several problems did come up. 1.) Flash-it needs time to recover after one or two shots. Not good. You can miss great shots waiting for it. I gave up with the flash and just trusted it to shoot using the light available-little to very low--and I gotta say--it worked a lot better. However 2.) it does not recover focus very fast--in fact, till it is allowed to recover, your next shots will be out of focus/blurred/noisy, etc. Again, you can miss some great shots. There are some ways to fix this last problem, I just need to review those-but I don't think it will help a lot. Note: I was shooting dancers in low light. I need to work this in full/bright light to do a better comparison.The movies this camera shoots are great (don't go looking for super-duper 'gee-whiz' stuff okay). And I did the movies with the light that was available (little to very-very low) and the movies actually turned out better than a lot of the photos I took. And with the software that comes with the camera (and Photoshop), you can take out single pictures from the movie. This proved to be a wonderful side-trip. I got a lot better photos just shooting with the movie function and taking out the 'photos'. I then layered the good photos over the fuzzy ones and got some fun, interesting work.Now, as for the batteries--I charged up 4 AA and I shot from about 7pm to 11pm going back and forth from single to movie. I only had to change the batteries for the last hour of shooting. I used Duracell's Rechargeable NiMH and a 16gb SCHC series 10 card by Transcend. Even with all that shooting, that card did not even get 1/2 full--I think I will get a 32gb--just for the fun of it and for movies and save the 16gb for photos.I am still happy with this camera, as I use it mainly to shoot my artwork and it does a wonderful job on that kind of single work. And for now, till I save up the $$$$$ to get the DSLR I really want-this is a perfect fill in for the price.""

"20111102","5.0","Great pictures awesome video/sound","I bought this camera to replace my Canon powershot A710IS. The SX150IS is a nice step up. It does a wonderful job in low light situations. The HD video is superb in low light situations as well. I'm especially happy with the recording mics on this camera. I use the video record option while at very loud karaoke bars. The sound is great, never over modulated.There are too many features to list here about this camera. Included is the owner's manual on cd.  I wish there was  a printed copy so that I can read it in a more comfortable position. Don't care to sit at the computer or waste ink printing out the whole thing. For those of you who already own it, I found a neat little extra. while the camera is in picture taking mode, hold the function button in for about a minute. The whole display becomes a digital clock. By rotating the wheel around the func button you can change the colors of the clock. Found that to be pretty neat. Not sure if it's in the owner's manual or not, but thought it was pretty neat to come across.The battery life is great. Be sure to use high MAH rated batteries. At least 2000 or more. If you want some long lasting superb battery performance, look into getting some eneloop rechargeables. They're put out by Sanyo and they're a very, very good battery. Check the reviews on them.If I had to choose anything negative about this camera it would probably be the flash operation. Most cameras in this class have a flash that will pop up automatically in the auto mode when required. This one does not do it automatically. It will let you know to pop the flash up manually yourself if needed but it doesn't do it automatically. That can be a good thing though too. This way you can override the flash option. It will still take the picture but just without the flash.""
"20111030","5.0","Love this Camera AGAIN","My camera was dropped and broke.  I researched and researched which new camera to buy and ended up going back to a newer model of the camera I had broken.  I don't think this camera can be beaten.  They have improved it over the last couple of years with the fisheye effect and also the focusing.  People often say I take wonderful pictures but I think it is really the camera.  For a  point and shot with  lots of options..... this is the camera to have.  It has one of the best zoom too.  I couldn't be happier.""
"20111028","4.0","Great point and shoot camera but a little bulky.","I updated the review.  I have been using this camera for around 6 months.PROS: Great control over the flash.  If you don't want it then leave it down.  If you do want it then just lift the flash with your finger.  Quality is good (but not great).Speed - camera is fast between pictures, fast to start up, etc.  I like snappy 'real time' menus and zooming etc.Focus - very very clear.  I used macro mode to take pictures of business cards and I can zoom in and see the hairs of the paper.  Very impressive, very important to me.  Took a picture of a letter on the wall 5 feet away with zoom.  I could review and zoom in and and read very fine print ~ 5pt type font!Low light - very good even without the flash.Screen: large, good quality - it is NOT a touch screen but I think it is much more durable than a touch and you don't need the touch as the controls are easy to use.Manual options: good manual options.Video: very good quality, you CAN zoom while filming. File size was too big for my taste in HD so I reduced the quality to normal.  Sound is so-so / average but perfectly acceptable.CONS:Update: 03-23-2012By far the lens is bulky even when closed.  This is the most serious drawback to this camera IF you intend to carry the camera in the front pocket of your pants or shirt.  I find myself using my cell phone camera because of the bulk and discomfort of keeping this point and shoot camera in my pocket.  It would be nice if the flash had more power and height when extended.Power button:  sometimes the lens has opened in my pocket (or attempted to) because the button was pressed.  Th button should have been smaller and / or harder to push to prevent this.Flash - at night when I open the flash I have seen the message flash is charging which takes a few seconds.  This delays the picture.  Wish it was a bit faster.The overall camera is kind of large to be a 'pocket camera'.  However, the lens is good quality and good in low light and has lots of zoom so this is a trade-off.  I would like it if the body was rubberized.  The hard plastic is slippery.Complexity of the manual settings.  I guess having more features or adjustments brings on this evil.  I'm getting better but sometimes I stumble or fumble to set the aperture or white balance etc.  I'm not sure how this could be simplified without adding more buttons and cluttering things up.What to buy: buy this camera or the Nikon ??? model that costs about $200.  The nikon is smaller and fits much better in your pocket and the lens is excellent and so is the whit balance inside.  Buy the Cannon for the more powerful lens.Kill the Paper Monster! - This camera has sharp focus, and good in low light (and many other camera brands are good too).I have all sorts of little notes, business cards etc.  I use this camera in macro (close up) mode with a table lamp and no flash to take a picture and then throw the paper out - get rid of clutter!!  Then I transfer to the computer and label and organize the pictures - Business cards, Letters etc so I can search for it later.  Manuals - watch, tool, instructions for a windshield for my scooter - will probably never need them but if I do it is in the computer in the 'manuals' folder.  Serial numbers - same deal.""
"20111021","4.0","Bring back the view finder!","Because I wanted more optical zoom, I upgraded from a Canon Powershot A1100IS with 4X to the SX150IS with 12X.  I am very happy with it with two exceptions.  It does not have a view finder like the older camera, which makes it difficult to take pictures in the sun.  Also, there is a new red button which instantly turns on movie mode.  Unfortunately, the red button is in the spot where I place my thumb, so I have movies of trees standing still.  Except for these problems, I think it is an excellent camera for the price and takes photos that are as good as the ones from my husband's $800 Canon SLR camera.""
"20111002","5.0","The best AA battery field use point-and-shoot available anywhere.","The new Canon SX 150 camera should probably be subtitled, 'Possibly The Best All-Around, Point-And-Shoot, Off-Road-Adventure Camera - Affordable - for the Average Person Today.'I recently bought this camera, the SX 150 HS, and I also have owned/used the earlier models in this same line for several years now - the SX 110, SX 120, and SX 130 - so I have several years experience with it, all of it very positive.  Yes, it runs on AA batteries, but that is the GOOD NEWS!  If you don't like that, then buy one of the 100 other cameras available that don't use them. Use some form of proprietary lithium-ion battery instead which will set you back $25 to $75 apiece for each spare battery, and it will not even last two functioning years. You will also need several of those batteries for any extended trip, and when you buy your next camera they won't fit it, so you can then just throw away that extra $100 to $200 in useless, expensive, non-interchangeable batteries.Now if you are an average person who doesn't HAVE an extra $100 to $200 to throw away every couple of years on proprietary batteries that only fit one camera, then please read on.This is the LAST REMAINING, top quality, 2-AA battery, point-and-shoot camera left on the market, people.  There are some very good economical reasons to PREFER that choice.  Anywhere you travel, you can ALWAYS buy - or borrow - AA batteries to keep it going.  The AA batteries are about as universal an item as exists on the planet, so you can still keep shooting this camera almost anywhere you go.  But you absolutely should use rechargeable AAs whenever you can to save money - a LOT of money. And they last much longer on each charge. I get about 350 large JPEG photos per charged set, and since I sometimes shoot a lot of photos in one place, I always carry at least two pairs of backup batteries to swap out.&&&&&&&UPDATE EDIT:  In Dec. 2011, I bought my first few sets of Sanyo eneloop AA rechargeable batteries.  Since then I have used them very, very successfully in this camera. On a recent field trip to the local mountains near Monterey, CA, I set out with a fully-charged pair of eneloop AA batteries in the SX150, and I carried a backup pair of eneloop AAs just in case.  I did a full day of shooting with 425 full-sized JPEGs and 8 minutes of HD video, and I used a lot of zoom and frequently turned the camera off and on too. That is a LOT of battery use for one set of AA batteries. The batteries finally ran out early the next day as I was testing some of the features on the camera. It is my understanding that it costs less than 1 cent apiece in household current to recharge them each time, and that they are guaranteed to recharge at least 1500 times. And they are also supposed to hold about 70% of their full charge even after three years just sitting on a shelf! (Unlike the older style of rechargeable AA batteries that lost their charge fairly quickly.) Since they last at least 2 to 3 times as long as standard alkaline batteries on each charge, that would represent a total savings of at least $1500 (fifteen hundred dollars) over the cost of buying 3000 alkaline batteries on sale at only 50 cents apiece FOR EACH PAIR OF AA ENELOOP BATTERIES that you would use on any other household devices in your own home.  Don't think of them as just being for use in a camera.  They work in everything requiring AA batteries.  Flashlights, computer mice, remotes (they make them in AAA too), children's toys, shop tools, wall clocks or anything else you might use them for in your home. They sell for about $20 on Amazon for an 8-pack of them.  That represents a savings of about $6000 over the 1500 cycle lifetime of each 8-pack of eneloop batteries you buy and use instead of regular alkaline batteries. Do the math yourself and you will be astounded by how many thousands of dollars they can save you around your home over a period of 5, 10 or even 20 years.BTW - As a special note.  The 'low battery' light comes on in the SX150 camera long before the batteries are actually dead.  That is because the SX150 is calibrated for 1.5 volt alkaline AA batteries.  The Sanyo eneloop AA rechargeable batteries only recharge to about 1.2 volts or 1.3 volts at most.  The camera 'thinks' they are low because it looks for a low voltage to decide that. Some cameras do have a menu item to change the battery check away from alkaline batteries (at 1.5 volts) to rechargeable batteries (at 1.2 or 1.3 volts), but I don't think the SX150 gives you that option. Just keep using them until they actually do run out and you will be surprised at how long they really do last.Best wishes to all,  - John&&&&&&&&Regular alkaline batteries don't last long, and are obviously WAY too expensive to use in any AA battery camera for more than very occasional shooting. That is printed right in the instruction manual.  Honestly, you are just supposed to know that fact ahead of time.You only use alkaline batteries in emergencies when you simply run out of the extra recharged ones you are carrying with you and you find yourself in a tight spot. Later on when you buy your next camera, you can transfer those same AA batteries to it without spending a dime buying a single new, proprietary lithium-ion battery in the whole process. Rechargeable AA batteries are unbelievably cheaper in the long run - and much better for the environment - if you add up all of the costs and waste involved in going through one new set of proprietary lithium-ion batteries after another as the years go by.That is probably this camera's best, preferred, long-term feature, but by no means its only good feature. It is also very light weight and compact.  It will not fit in your shirt pocket, but it is not supposed to.  Your shirt pocket is where your cell phone goes with its own built-in camera. The slightly larger and heavier (and much better image quality) Canon SX 130 or SX 150 will fit easily into your coat pocket, travel bag, or purse, which is where it belongs, anyway.Should you buy the new SX 150 if you already have an SX 130? That depends on you, but especially on whether you want a backup camera with you when you go out on a photo shoot.  On my most recent trip I took my older SX 120 camera with me as a backup. I don't want to be out in the wilderness with no backup camera, and the best backup camera is the one closest to my current camera as possible. On my next trip I will take my SX 150 and my SX 130 will become my new backup camera.Now I will sell my older SX 120, which still works fine after three years, to somebody else who understands the reliable and cost-effective value of having a good 2-AA point-and-shoot camera. That has been my experience with the whole Canon SX 100+ Power Shot line over the last several years now, and it has all been very positive. I hope this review may help others who may not have seen some of this economical, common sense information discussed in this way before.  Best wishes and good photo results to all.UPDATE:  There is at least one other important option with the SX 150 that I have not really described here in my original post, but since it is a generally affordable one it deserves some serious consideration.  It is the option my wife and I personally chose and have used with wonderful success together through the SX120, SX130 and now the SX150 model cameras. You can buy 2 - Canon SX150s, for the price of 1 - Canon SX40.  (We do actually own an SX40, too, but we have found we rarely use it except for super-long 35X telephoto shots. It is just too cumbersome for us to carry around with us most of the time in it's separate camera bag.) My wife carries one SX150 with her, I carry the other. (She chose a black one, I wanted a red one!)  At least one of us ALWAYS has at least one of those two SX150 cameras with us at all times.  Together we get more good shots that way and under a wider variety of circumstances than either of us would separately. And we teach each other new techniques with the camera.  If I figure out a new manual setting, I teach it to her.  She may discover a new camera angle that had not occurred to me to try. We have found that when we shoot the very same field trip together we shoot different things because we zero in on different things. We complement each other's photography, and that has been an even more fulfilling experience for us personally to share together.Again best wishes,  John""
"20110930","4.0","Nice camera for someone wanting a little more than a point and shoot.","I bought this camera to replace the Canon Powershot SX130 that my daughter took to school with her.  The only thing I was initially disappointed in with the purchase was that a memory card did not come with it (note to self; read the fine print!  Other than that, I like that this camera gives you options/settings to use for different types of photo opportunities.  I have taken some very nice quality photos of pets (horses, dogs, cats) as well as trip photos and am pleased with the clarity of the photos and the fact that, if the settings are right, the photos can be printed in large sizes.  I took a photo up close of a feathered tulip; the photo was even more striking when I had it printed in an 11 x 14 size - it won first place in its division at state fair).I'm not as pleased with the video quality on this camera as I was on a previous Sony point and shoot camera I had.  The pro is that you can zoom in and out while videotaping (I couldn't do that on other camera).  The con is that the image is not as clear as I would like.It takes a while to learn all the settings on the camera, especially for a novice like myself; but I like the options and the fact that it is small enough to take anywhere.""
"20110921","2.0","disappointed","The picture is not as sharp and the color is not as rich as the model I was replacing, the sx 100 is. I took identical shots with both cameras and was disappointed that even with less pixels and older processors, the sx 100 took a better picture. Go figure.""
"20110916","4.0","Good step-up camera between ultra-compact and DSLR","First, let me say that while I am not a professinal photographer, I do earn some money from photographing weddings and other events for friends and acquaintences, and consider myself to be an advanced user and photography enthusiast. I shoot primarily with Canon DSLRs and was looking for a compact camera to supplement my current photography equipment.  The Canon PowerShot XS150 IS is a very nice compliment to my gear and overall, I am pleased with it.Canon has produced a very good alternative for the compact camera market in its PowerShot XS150 IS platform.  The camera boasts a 14MP picture size with 12x optical zoom capability and the camera delivers.  The XS150 IS is a little larger and heavier than most compact cameras but is of quality construction and durable.  The case is molded plastic and has a very ergonomic design with specific places to rest your fingers and thumb for one-hand operation. All the controls can be operated with the right hand while holding the camera.The picture quality is very good.  Canon's processor provides vivid colors and impressive clarity for a compact design. The large viewing screen is impressive and easy to see, even in bright sunlight. The controls are easy to use and placed such that they won't be accidentally changed.  The controls in the on-screen menu are easy to use and, if you're familiar with Canon's menu system, you'll be able to start shooting right away.  Those that aren't familiar with Canon should read the manual, but even then, the menu selections and control layout are very intuitive and easy to use.The camera provides a lot of special shooting features that can be used not only for still photography, but also for the video recording. There's an 'easy shooting' mode for those that want to pick up the camera and start shooting right away, allowing the camera to make all the decisions about ISO, white balance, focus, etc. There are scene and filter shooting modes that allow the photographer to select a style for their photos (monochrome, color accent, color replacement, miniature mode, macro, smile and face detection, beach and snow scenes, fireworks, etc.). For those that want more control over their photography, the camera does offer shooting modes in Manual, Program, Aperture and Shutter Priority.The movie feature works well and provides decent HD video that can be copied directly from the SD card to your computer. The movie feature is a nice function, but keep in mind that this camera is not a movie camera, so don't expect Hollywood quality from it, but it's nice enough to document short events for display on HD TVs and the web.  The stereo sound for the movie function is quite good as well, but the microphones will pick up the sound of the zoom lens motor whirring if you use the zoom feature while shooting video.  The lens motor sound can probably be minimized or eliminated in some video or sound editing programs such as Adobe Premier, DVD Studio Pro, or Soundbooth, etc.The flash is a little different for this camera.  It's centered over the telescoping lens but is manually activated (you have to lift the flash open with your finger) to turn on the auto-flash feature.  While this may seem like an annoyance at first, it's actually not a bad feature, just different; and it prevents that annoying 'pop-up' of the flash when you really don't want flash but the camera's sensors require it.The XS150 IS is a little larger and heavier than most other compact cameras but is still very portable.  The weight and size are detemined mostly by the fact that the camera uses two AA batteries, and the size of the lens for this camera. Still it's a small camera for what it can do and will easily fit into a cargo pocket or purse, or in a case that can be worn on a belt or attached to a backpack.The only real complaint I have about the camera is the battery life with alkaline AA batteries (this is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5).  While it's nice to have a camera that accepts a common battery type (AA) that can be purchased almost anywhere in the world, I would recommend getting the rechargeable NiMH AA batteries because the battery life for alkiline AA batteries seems to be a little short, especially if you're going to shoot video.Overall, this is a great compact camera and it will meet most user's needs especially if they are looking for a camera that provides a lot of shooting features in a small package with HD video and is easy to learn to use. I highly recommend it.""

I am looking forward to learning about all the manual settings that I can play with but even the preset settings are just amazing and super easy. I was taking pictures minutes after opening the box.

"20120518","5.0","excellent camera","After reading a lot of reviews on several cameras i decided to purchase this one. I have had it for a good while now, and it has worked perfectly. The picture quality is amazing, and the videos are also great. The zoom is very good. With my old camera the quality got terrible when you zoomed in just a little, but even when you use the digital zoom on this, the picture remains clear. When i bought this, the one thing i worried about was the battery life, because there were many reviews saying that it was terrible. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Granted it does use batteries a little bit faster than some cameras, but all you have to do is get good batteries or some rechargeable ones.YOU CANNOT JUDGE THE BATTERY LIFE FROM THE BATTERIES THEY SEND WITH IT.""
"20120514","3.0","Good features but lousy battery","Been playing with this camera a lot and really like the features. In particular I like to take photos at night while i'm camping and the manual controls are a must. The effects like fish eye and so fourth are also really cool and fun to play with. My complaints are that in low light it won't auto focus unless you shine a light to illuminate the subject first. The battery life is lousy just like the reviews say. I turned down the LCD and turned off all the features I thought could save power. I got at least 50 photos or more with no flash and a few minutes of video. When it does video is when the batteries really go fast. Not a big deal, I'll get some eneloop batteries. Nice to have the option of AA for emergency and you can use the rechargeable batteries in other devices like flashlights, unlike cameras with special batteries. Only bummer is I found this same camera local at Fry's Electronics for 99 bucks! Even with tax would have saved about 50 dollars and that is a lot of batteries! That price is way lower then any other brick and mortar around here. Too bad they were out of stock on them or I would of returned this one to amazon and got it at fry's. Oh well..... I really wanted a SLR but just don't have the money for something that is for camping, hunting, and fishing. This is the right price to beat up in the field. Plus SLR are so big and heavy it would end up staying in my truck.""
"20120514","2.0","More than disappointed","The quality of the pictures with this camera is no better than my little $50 digital camera of another brand.  Even worse is the seller made an offer to take it back and then when I asked for the address and information to do so, they said oops, that offer was a mistake.  So now I'm stuck with an expensive piece of junk.  I filed a complaint with Amazon and surprisingly they are supporting the seller in their wishy washy policies.  The item and entire experience is a disappointment.""
"20120506","4.0","Easy camera and great videocamera features","I own a previous Canon PowerShot S5 IS (8M, I bought back at 2008) and found it to be a great camera, on the prosumer side. The zoom features were very good, and too late I found out that the when taking video, the quality was very good, but for todays technology is regular.Based on the Canon personal reference and because the SX150 had a great deal at the local Costco, I decided to buy it. The main reason was that I wanted to take advantage of it size compared to my previous canon, and also because the video is a 720p HD, better than the420 of my previous camera. I was aware the SX150 was not a direct replacement, it was more on the 'pocket camera' side than on the 'prosumer camera' side.Pros: The pictures taken with the camera are very good. Very nice detail, simple to use, smaller if compared with my previous camera (still qualify as pocket camera). It has some very cool features as to filter the image to just the color you want, i.e. if you select green, it will provide a picture/video on gray tones and will let the green objects to be unfiltered. The video is not full HD, it is 720p, but for my Mac, it is enough for great home video edition. Simple to use. The anti shaking filter is really awesome, it will provide really nice stand video when filming. I actually prefer this video quality than other HD camcorders. I also bought a 16GB memory, so I have almost 2hrs of video, plus all the pictures I want. Unless you are a professional that shoots the straigth 2 hrs, 16GB will be more than enough for your family daily activitiesCons: Unlike my previous Canon, the display cannot be twisted, turned off, moved on angle (tilted), and if you have used this features, you really missed it. The lens is slightly smaller, but does not really impact the quality. An small spec somehow go inside the camera lens, and even though this is not affecting the pictures yet, I found it to be really discomforting (my previous Canon never got dust inside the lens). It is kind of slower than my previous camera so some time is required to actually shot the object (specially my kids).Some people complain a lot about the battery life, and I was aware of that, so I take an alternative approach. I bought 4 AA rechargeable batteries and an small camera case, and every time I take the camera with me, I have the extra batteries. The camera actually consume a lot of power, and I have found that for a regular 5 hrs of use, the battery needs to be replaced. So far I have not spend the two pairs, so this approach has worked really good.So at the end, if you see the cost-benefit, for a 150USD you get a really nice product, excellent pictures, great video, affordable and a easy to use camera. Is it the best? of course not, but the 150USD are unbeatable for what you get.""
"20120503","4.0","Not for pocketing around","If you are looking to carry a camera anywhere and everywhere you go, in your pocket, bag or something small, this camera is definitely bulky. The size is chunky and you need a separate carry bag to hold it along with its batteries, cables. If you are a person who shoots once in a while and does not mind carrying a case on your shoulder, this camera is a good choice.Good:*Picture quality is very sharp*HD Video is extremely vivid and captures great detail*Transferring data is very easy, I just plug in the memory card to my Mac*Great focus and lens speed.*Image stabilizer works very wellNot so good:*Size and weight*Time between consecutive shots*Zoom is a touch slow*Flash needs to be manually popped upOverall I did a lot of research before buying this camera and except for its bulkiness this canon is a wonderful choice for the price it is offered at. If you are not so professional and need a decent camera with good zoom,HD video then you should go for this model.""
"20120502","5.0","The features have sold me on this camera","This camera has so many features that I was blown away at how much I could do with it for such a small price. Most reviews say that the battery life is horrible, but I'm using the pre-packaged panasonic cheap-o batteries and have already taken 150 photos all while playing with the settings for several hours and it's still going! I admit that I'm not using the flash, since they are outside photos, but I can see it lasting longer than some of the other reviews state.The camera is a nice weight and size, not cumbersome at all. The buttons are well placed and I love that you don't have to switch modes to video. This is really handy for those imprompto times that photos are being taken and you really wish you would have taped it instead!I recommend this camera for a person that is going one step up from a simple point and click and wanting to learn more about amateur photography.""
"20120502","4.0","Good Features","Has a lot of features normally not found on cameras in this price range. Feels solid in your hands. I would recommend buying a case but be aware that this camera is slightly bigger than the compact pocket size cameras so make sure the case is large enough. This camera will not fit in your shirt or pants pocket. Flash does not pop up automatically so you have to remember to flip it up if needed. Photo quality is very good and the various photo modes are fun to use if you are creative. The only negatives is that there is no SD card included and the batteries included gave out after a day of testing the features. You need to buy AA Lithium type batteries.""

"20120422","1.0","Battery devourer","So as a regular consumer I have conducted research among more than 30 digital cameras of different brands such as Nikon, Fujifilm, Canon, Panasonic, Sony, Casio and Olympus. I was looking for several main things in my new camera: compatibility with AA batteries,compact (this canon is a bit heavy and bulky but is still ok to fit in a pocket), zoom of at least 10x, HD video, manual settings (for night photos) and low budget (below $300)Why AA batteries?Based on my nikon L2 experience (yeah, I know that camera is really old, but that's why I wanted to get a new one) that used regular AA batteries served me for filming 60+mins of video and several dozens of pictures and also looking through them on the camera, so rechargeable AAs would last at least 2x as much, right?Main complaint: Battery life is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I am about to cry because I thought and researched for an entire month on which camera to pick and this is what I get?Details of main complaint:Firstly, I took 2 panasonic general purpose batteries,- camera would start, work for 5 seconds and then shut off saying 'change the batteries' Nice start, eh?Secondly, I took regular duracell batteries (brand new of course) that lasted for about 20 pics and a 6 min video and then again 'change the batteries'. I could still take pictures with that camera after I would wait for 30 seconds and turn it on, it would just stop after some time, so even though it works but with all these interruptions by this stupid message 'change the batteries' I can't shot pictures continuously and I can't shoot a video for more than 6 minutes.Alright, ok, I'm calm, so I decided to use the big guns- brand new rechargeable 2500 mA/h NiMH GP AA batteries (I bought it specifically for this camera). Guess what? 42 pictures (wow, impressive indeed) and about 10 mins of video before the message 'change the batteries'. And once I try to start the camera, it starts, works for only 2 seconds and shuts off. I inserted the second pair of the same rechargeable 2500 mA/h NiMH GP AA batteries that I just charged and once I turned on the camera I saw the battery icon which meant that I should change the batteries soon. What the hell?Picture quality:I wasn't able to take ANY sharp images of moving objects such as pets- nuh-huh, all of 'em were blurry. There's is a lot of compression in the camera going on for eg. why does a 7mp pic weigh 2.2 mb whereas the same EXACT pic with 14 mp weigh only 3.38 mb? what happened to the other 1mb? I'm not an expert on cameras, I might not understand something, but I tried to look for the difference in between those shots and I found NONE (I tried really hard). Same colors, same resolution, same noise, everything the same. Btw, the pictures are noisy once you zoom in even at 80 ISO, but I guess that's ok for a $200 camera? Maybe?Night pictures are pretty good, just be sure to have a tripod so the pictures are sharp. The modes, like miniature, vivid colors, B/W, Sepia, Toy camera (really cool) and others are very nice, I loved them.Video quality:Video seems to be crisp, surely better than the 480p on my old camera, as long as you use an SDHC or SDXC card for HD video (I have a transcend SDHC class 10 8gb card) though the zoom in during the video recording is very slow (some say to prevent blurriness- bulls***, still blurry until I wait for 2 seconds or so to let it focus). For example to go from 1x to 12x zoom in a video you will have to wait for 13 seconds. 'Very' fast right? The sound is stereo, no complains there. You can't take pictures while filming.Flash:Oh yeah, this baby deserves a separate paragraph. I, personally, like the idea of a manual flash, meaning you can bring it up or down manually. Ok, so you are about to push the button fully down to take a picture, just to observe that it is charging instead of taking a picture. Errr.. ok? So it charges for 2 seconds and only then you can take a picture. Once you took a picture, you have to wait for another 2 seconds for the flash to recharge, seriously? Recharging before and after? Nonsense. Sometimes the flash would recharge for even more than 2 seconds depending on the battery you have (with duracells prepare for about 5 seconds of recharge, those 2s were with the 2500 mA/h batteries)Overall score:If I had a chance, I would give this camera ZERO stars, sure the pictures are ok, and the video is ok.Let's even assume the camera has DSLR quality pictures and full HD video (which it doesn't) are you still willing to change batteries every hour, even rechargeable ones? Let's put it this way, how do you call a car that eats 60gal/mi of gasoline? Exactly-USELESS.Don't buy this, save your nerve cells and precious money, I'm returning this back and I will try to find a better camera. If you don't mind, please, tell me what are the good compact cameras with an HD video, at least 10x optical zoom, manual settings and most importantly- with a GOOD battery life.""

I am very happy with this camera it does everything I wanted an more. As advertised the Canon does use batteries up rapidly but the quality of the pictures makes it worth the money. I have not tried lithium batteries yet but will try those at some point to see it it improves enough to be worth the extra for the lithium batteries. Thank you Amazon for once more coming through when needed, we were leaving on vacation and ordered this just one week before we were leaving it came overnight and was perfect for our needs.""
"20120419","5.0","Great manual control with all the digital perks!","I have only had the camera for a few days & I'm so happy I opted for this one.  My last camera was the Sony Cybershot & before that a Nikon Coolpix (1 of the early models), & while they are good cameras there were flaws that I couldn't get around.  My favorite setting to play with is lighting, & I've found that most new models of digital cameras have too bright of a flash & can't manage a good photo w/out it (including many times w/a tripod).After using this one for only a few days, I'm ready to swear off 'compact' digital cameras.  This camera is a perfect option for someone looking to go digital but retain the control levels of a manual camera.  It's slightly larger than most compact cameras but not to its demise in my opinion.  The weight feels good in your hands, & so far I am pleased with the quality of this camera all around.  Of course every picture doesn't turn out perfect, but that's the point of having control over your settings.  If all you're looking for is non-blurry snapshots, perhaps look elsewhere, but in terms of photography, for beginners amateurs, or enthusiasts (me), this is a great choice!""
"20120418","5.0","Removes the need for Photoshop!","The features on this camera have made me need my photoshop so much less. I used to go in to edit lighting, brighten colors, add a flash, and create selective coloring. The only thing I really use my photoshop for with this camera now is to crop my pictures into a 4x6 or 5x7 image (heads tend to get cut off if you send in a digital image without doing this first). I had a Nikon P100 (which I also loved) and I traded up with this. I still have the manual option which I absolutely LOVE!Only drawback I have noticed is that the flash can take time to charge. I was drawn back by the AA batteries as well but I bought rechargable ones and they work just as great as a regular rechargable battery.""

"20120415","3.0","You get what you pay for...or less","Great price on a near superzoom.  I like canon P&Ss.  The size is fine.  Newish model.  Ok specs.Unfortunately, an immediate surprise.  It takes 2 AA batteries.  I broke out two new alkalines just to test and the very first picture wouldn't take.  Instead a message like 'Flash needs time tocharge.'  On the first picture with new batteries!  This kept happening.  A slow camera to say the least.I played with it a bit (indoors) and noticed only modest blur (good) but a lot of image noise.  A good comparison camera is the Canon Elph 300/310 HS.  It's pics have less noise and and it's much faster.  It has better video (1080 vs 720).  Of course, the Elphs are much smaller.  The Elphs are similarly priced.  The advantage embedded in the SX150? --- of course, the 12x zoom.  This might have some meaning versus the Elph 300 and it's 5x zoom but the 310 has 8x zoom.So, I love Canon but cannot recommend this model.  If you want a real superzoom bite the bullet and try the more expensive SX40 (35x but bigger --- and better).  (I haven't tried the SX260 which is priced between the two and 20x.  (It has GPS which I don't need.)""

I don't want to lug a charger around, I don't want to balance multiple in-camera batteries, etc...I've owned that type of camera before and it isn't charged when you need it and I hate carrying extra gear.  Basically, I charge my smart phone (8MP) every other day, I don't want to have the same worries with my camera.So, now you have my battery philosophy--convenience means a camera that is always ready to go.  So, I bought this camera just before my European vacation (thank you next day delivery from Amazon).  The AA batteries, as mentioned in other reviews, lasted about a 100 pictures plus 10 videos.  When the low battery light came on I just slapped in some new batteries and I was always ready.The pictures:  Great!  The 10x zoom, incredible.  The 14MP detail, excellent.  The HD camera, not bad (you can change the zoom while filming video).  Raising the flash to take a picture was actually nice, which was unexpected...I liked that the flash couldn't go off by accident in some of the museums I visited.The camera is NOT as large as I expected it to be.  It fit right in my windbreaker pocket.  It would easily fit in cargo pants/shorts pockets.  Of course, this isn't a super small camera and it will NOT fit in jean pockets, unless you have pretty loose jeans.I spent weeks searching for the right camera, this was the right choice for me.Note--I use rechargeable AA batteries at home in everything (remotes, flashlights, camera, toys) and always have extras charged.  But while mobile on vacation, I buy regular, cheap alkaline AAs for convenience, back to my first paragraph above.""

IT just does not hold a charge for very long and sometimes there isn't a plug to recharge it.( I am talking about the Powershot  A3300).

"20120408","4.0","Great stills, inferior video","This medium-small camera takes pretty terrific still pictures in all sorts of light. Even with the ISO cranked up to max, the pictures are very usable. Get at least 4 Eneloop AA rechargeable batteries. The Alkalines wear out fast.Pros:--pretty terrific still images--wide end of zoom is not as great as one going to the equivalent of 24mm, but 28mm isn't bad at all--you can easily control depth of field by using the aperture priority mode, and let the camera set the shutter speed -- something I use a lot--equally you can set the shutter speed you want and let the camera pick the iris--full manual control if you want to go there--even full auto mode is quite good--good range of ISO / sensitivity--extreme close-focus at wide end of zoom, which I also use a lot--able to shoot multiple shots just holding down the trigger (set the function to that mode)--auto focus seems to work and track well--rather large zoom range, though I mostly use the camera at the full wide end and adjust the frame by moving closer or farther way.Not so good:--inferior video -- this one is a serious defect, the others not so much--too big to fit in a pocket well -- small but bulky--no way to bracket exposure automatically--limited iris (doesn't open very wide or close down very much)For the price, a terrific little camera.""

"20120327","4.0","Canon Power Shot SX150 IS","We bought this camera to replace our 'office' camera for candids at events. The quality of the photos is wonderful, and,surprisingly, the little manual lift-up flash is pretty powerful even in a less-than-optimally lit room. We like the true wide angle nature of the lens for group shots also. However, I was astonished to find that a pair (the camera uses only two)of AA name-brand alkaline batteries lasted only 50 shots. We have purchased a set of four NiMH batteries and charger ($20), but have not used them extensively enough to see if there's a difference. Be aware that if you're shooting inside mostly, you'll need to pack a spare set of batteries if you use the camera for more than an hour. Also, if you leave the camera in AUTO mode, your right thumb is likely to press the REC button as the thumb rest is poorly placed and is very small.""

"20120314","4.0","Batteries, You Need Batteries","Needed a camera in a hurry and bought mine on the road in Best Buy today. Paid a bit more than this (what ever the current price shown is), but walked out of the store with it. Used it minutes later.My verified purchaser copy of this review is at the Canon SX130. Liked the 150 so well that I ordered the slightly less featured 130 a couple of days after buying the 150.Controls are 'intuitive' if you have had a few digital cameras. Pics look great for the documentation and illustration that I do. All the features and gee-wiz may be fantastic for all I know. Do you need a self-timer that starts when you enter the picture and blink your eyes? I don't think I do, but you might.Easy access to manual control is great when images must match in exposure for after-the-fact editing. No raw output tho. Turn off the image review or you spend your time waiting in between pics.Larger size and greater weight make it easier to hand hold especially in lower light. And image stabilization really works well. This camera could better use strap lugs, rings, and a shoulder strap instead of a wrist strap. Ring type selector around the function set button beats hell out of a slew of tiny buttons and lots of tabbed sub menus. - A little too easy to bump things tho while intending to change one setting and accidentally changing another.Experiments moving from sensitivity of 80 or 100 have been mixed. I'm not impressed. With most digitals and oh so long ago with film I have found that higher sensitivity is a trade-off with noise.This camera uses batteries. Take a bunch of the highest capacity NiMH AA that you can get your hands on. Make sure they are in good shape and fully charged! I'm getting 100 to 150 shots out of each pair of new 2300s before getting a low battery warning. Or about two thirds the number of shots from what I got out of my previous camera. - Have to figure that features like image stabilization are not a loss-free operation.A Targus TGC SC610 Case will hold this camera and four more AA batteries easily. Belt loop looks a little iffy, but a carabiner as a back-up gives me peace of mind.I think this camera will work out fine for what I need: clear shots with good detail.""
"20120313","5.0","LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!","This camera is great!  A co-worker and I each bought this camera and we love it.  She just got back from Mexico and all of the pictures were beautiful!  The colors and the clarity of each image is amazing.  I also love the fish eye effects-the pictures you can come up with are so entertaining.  My favorite things also include the automatic function that will take a self portrait when it sees a smile, and the fact that it takes AA batteries.  Nothing is better when traveling than being able to use regualar batteries that are readily available almost everywhere.  There's nothing worse than having to recharge a battery when you're out and about and won't be near a plug-in until evening.  I always use the Energizer max battieries.  I was able to go to Europe and use only 2 sets of those while taking over 1400 pictures.  Just keep an extra set or 2 with you and you're always ready to roll.  Both me and my co-worker will be heading to Vegas in 2 weeks and I'm so excited to be able to see what kind of pictures we can get there!""
"20120312","5.0","Great for beginner family shots!","I researched several cameras on Black Friday.  I needed something that could take clear shots of my children as well as clear shots while my children played sports.  This camera is easy to use and takes great action photos.  I read several reviews where people complained about the battery life.  If you get lithium batteries, you will get plenty of time before they go out.  I don't use my camera every day, but I am still on the same set of batteries that I put in back in early December.  If you are looking for a good every day camera and a good price, this is your camera.  If you are looking to take pictures of butterflys on flowers, spend the money and go with the more expensive Cannons.""

"20120308","5.0","Underrated!","I purchased this camera in October of 2011 after my old point-and-shoot finally kicked the bucket. I needed something that was a step up from a P&S, but not too big. I chose this, and I'm glad I did. I love this camera. I've taken over 1000 photos and 25 videos so far, and I haven't encountered any serious issues yet.Overall, the camera body feels nice. It's a little larger than the smaller point-and-shoot cameras, so it wont really fit well in your pocket like other little point-and-shoots (fits in coat pockets though). It's also a little heavy, but I actually like that because it feels like I'm holding a real camera. I'm a 5'11' slim male, and this fits perfectly in my right hand. It's not rubberized at all, but there are grooves on the front and back of the camera that allow for a nice firm grip, and it comes with a little cord to go around your wrist. I'm not worried about dropping this thing at all. The buttons are large and easy to press. Also, Canon seems to be known for user-friendly menus within the camera. It took me 2 seconds to figure out this menu system.These claims of 20 or 30 photos on a new pair of batteries is ridiculous! Don't bother using the cheapo alkaline batteries that come with it, just save them for your TV remote or something. When I bought this camera, I bought two pairs of rechargeable Energizers to go with it. I don't use those batteries for anything but this camera, and I always stick them in the charger when I get home after using the camera, so I have two fresh pairs when I leave the house the next day. Like I said, I've taken a bunch of photos with this, and I've only had to change out the batteries a few times along the way. I haven't actually kept track to see exactly how many photos I can take on one set of batteries, so don't ask me for a specific number. I just know one day I took 50 photos and 20 minutes of video without killing the batteries. Another day, I took 70 photos where each photo was a 15 second exposure on a 2-second timer, so it probably took a little more juice for each photo than a regular snapshot. The camera was also on for at least two hours straight that day, and the batteries didn't actually die... The days where the batteries do die is when I'm out with my friends taking many photos, lengthy videos, constantly browsing through menus to adjust settings, etc... Really though, I don't have a problem with battery life. Note: Right when I got this camera, I adjusted any power saving options I could find so that I could make my batteries last as long as possible. Turning down the LCD brightness and whatnot is something I do with all of my electronics. I suggest you do the same.The video mode is nice. It records 1280x720, very nice quality video. The sound is OK. You can zoom in and out while recording, though you can hear the motor moving a little bit. The only time you wont hear it is when taking video where there is loud music or other noise. It also zooms in and out fairly slowly. This may be a problem if you plan on using this mainly for video. If that's your plan, go get yourself an actual camcorder. Your son's baseball game really deserves better than this. I use this video mode for little moments with friends that I want to upload to Facebook/Youtube, and maybe just the grand finale of a fireworks show (but certainly not the whole show).The colors and sharpness are great. It focuses well and generally chooses the correct settings. It also offers various manual controls, which are pretty easy to use. I'm able to play around with shutter speed, aperture, ISO, white balance, and several creative filters. Though I shot in auto mode all the time when I first got this camera, I usually find myself flipping it into manual mode quite often these days. Occasionally, the automatic settings actually chose better settings than I do, but there are other times where the camera just isn't seeing exactly what I'm seeing, and these manual controls allow me to fix this and capture exactly what it is that my eyes see. I personally don't let the ISO go past 400 because photos do come out quite grainy in the high ISO settings. I compensate with the widest aperture possible and a longer shutter speed. Because of these manual controls, this camera actually does very well in low-light situations, assuming you have at least somewhat steady hands. Otherwise, there's a nice flash on top of the camera you can just pop up when you feel it's necessary.Also, I feel as though it is very important to point out that this camera, like many others, does NOT come with a memory card. I don't understand why people are complaining about that. It's NORMAL for cameras to not come with a memory card. I got a SanDisk 16GB SDHC card to go with my camera, which is really more than enough (I could even use this card in an SLR). I also decided to get an SDHC card reader so that I wouldn't have to plug a cord into my camera and turn it on every time I want to pull my photos off it. It's just much quicker and easier that way. Note: The memory card is located in the same compartment as the batteries on the bottom of the camera, so hold it upside down when sliding the cover open so the batteries don't fall out.I'm really not sure what else to say. This is a great camera that I feel is a bit underrated. 5 Stars all the way from me. This is my first ever review, so I hope I made sense :)""

"20120226","5.0","Best AA Battery Camera Out there!!!","Alright, where to begin! I bought this camera on Dec. 18, 2011 so I have had a lot of time to work with it!To start with, the FIRST thing I would purchase are good batteries - not a typical retail brand such as Duracell or Energizer Rechargeable, as they don't hold up, but a Camera Quality AA! I bought the 4 pack OPTEX 2500 mAh NiMH Rechargeable.The 4 pk is great as when you are out in the field, the spare can be a life saver! I tested the Energizers mAh NiMH Rechargeable first and out in the cold in the middle of winter they were flat dead within about 1 1/2 hours. The OPTEX were strong for about 3+ hours and then after I took about 80+ photos came home, plugged the camera into the TV and then spent roughly 45 minutes viewing them - still no low battery. When the 'low battery' light does finally come on in the SX150 camera, you still end up with a decent amount of time before the batteries are actually dead.The SECOND thing is a good SD Card. I purchased the 'PATRIOT LX Series' 16 GB / Class 10 SDHC Card. It's Fast, Reliable and GREAT with the 720p Video Recording!Now onto the CANON POWERSHOT SX150 IS ...I upgraded to this from my Canon Powershot A590 and WOW what a difference! The first thing I did notice between the two is the scrolling wheel on the SX150 made everything feel smooth. The second thing I noticed is that with the A590, using the 'AUTO' setting was pretty much 'Good Enough.' With the SX150 it is NOT, as I found that it generally shot with a higher then necessary ISO (usually 400-800) leading to grainy photos. That meant I had to learn how to use the 'MANUAL' setting. For that reason, I am actually glad as now I have learned a great deal with the Shutter and the Aperture, and whatever else.The 'Special Screen Mode' and 'Creative Filter Mode' in this camera such as the Fisheye effect, Miniature effect, Toy Camera, Poster effect, Color swap, Super vivid are also great additions to the Powershot series!I've been using the SX150 a lot for Outdoor and Animal shots. I've gotten some impressive bird shots that were bright, clean and clear, especially as 80 ISO.VIDEO was the other thing that impressed me a great deal in comparing to the A590. First, it shoots in 720p rather than the standard def which is nice! I compared the two by recording at a Metal Concert and there is basically no comparison! With the A590 the quality was basic and the sound was brutal when the Bass Guitar was being played. The SX150 was smooth, clear and rather still as it seemed not to shake when I was cheering along with the rest of the fans.With this camera, I have now had 10+ photos appear on TV via The Weather Network and have been printed in a couple different Local Papers.I honestly think that once you've mastered this camera, your next one should be a SLR.One other note:A lot of people have been comparing the SX150 to the SX40. A friend of mine has the SX40 and when you look at the quality between the two, they are almost identical! The only big difference I notice is that the SX40 has a 35x Optical Zoom as the SX150 has a 12x Optical Zoom. To me that was not worth an additional $200.All The Best!""
"20120226","2.0","Disappointing picture sharpness","Tried to find camera that was easy to use while delivering consistently reliable photo sharpness.  Will continue to look for the sharpness part. It is easy to use for point and shoot if you ignore all of the options, but focus is never quite right.""
"20120226","2.0","Not a simple camera to use","We bought this camera to replace a previous older Canon Power Shot that we liked. I thought the camera was large enough so that it was easy to hold and would avoid those blurry pictures you get with those very small cameras which are difficult to hold and press the button without moving the camera. This camera is not easy to grip. It is awkward to hold and you had better keep the strap around your wrist or it's going down.  The focus is slow when you push the button down halfway and wait. We get many blurry or dark pictures which have to be deleted. The flip-up flash is confusing because the camera doesn't inform you that the light is too low, so you're on your own judging whether the light is sufficient. I would not buy this camera if you need a simple larger reliable camera.""
"20120215","5.0","Awesome Camera","Wow.  This Canon PowerShot SX150IS is great.  I had a Kodak Easy Share V705 practially from the day it hit the market, which I'd used and loved for all the years I owned it ... small, convenient to carry in a pocket, produced great photos, and lots of capabilities (enlarge/crop/lighten/darken/etc).  Then one day last Fall while on a trip, the camera quit - shutter problem and staying charged problem.  All comments I read indicated other owners of same camera with same problem had virtually no luck correcting the problem, short of sending it to the company for 'costly' repair.  So .... I went hunting for a new camera instead.  I researched User comments, quality write-ups, etc. and decided on the Canon PowerShot SX150IS, which I purchased from Amazon.  I have not been disappointed.  Great value; good price.  I am still in learning process with all the many, many features.  Photo quality is superb.  Negatives for me: Camera is too large to fit in my pocket, and I purchased a camera case that turned out to be too small - don't know if Amazon would exchange the case for a larger one; I did not notify Amazon.  Regardless of that mistake, I am happy with the camera.""
"20120210","4.0","replacing older Canon","I purchased my first digital camera in 2007 for a vacation and have been very pleased with it's performance.  However, the past couple of vacations I've taken had me wanting a new camera with a few more features, especially for video and zoom.  After spending a lot of time looking at cameras on a variety of websites, I chose the Canon PowerShot SX150 IS to replace my older Canon.  While the comments about battery life originally had me a little nervous, now that I've used the camera for a couple of months (purchased in Nov) I'm VERY pleased with it's performance.Here's the trick regarding the batteries - go for a QUALITY rechargeable battery.  Rechargeable Energizers, Duracell's, etc are nice, but won't cut for extended periods of time with this camera.  I purchased Eneloop rechargeable's for my old camera (had actually purchased more this past summer for general use), and they work great in the new camera.  When I first got the camera and I put in 'fresh' batteries (ones I thought were charged), the low-battery light immediately came on, so I popped them into my old camera.  Sure enough, the low-battery light came on for the old camera as well.  After that (which was November), I put in what I knew were freshly charged batteries, and I haven't had to change the batteries yet.  So I've used the same batteries for 3 months, taken several hundred photos and videos, as well as having turned it on and off throughout all the photo-taking numerous times.So far my only complaint about the camera is that to use some of the more advanced/fun features I have to do some additional reading of the manual.  Not that this is a problem, I just have to find the time to read & play before my next vacation.""

"20120205","1.0","Fail - Not a replacement for PS A650 IS","We lost our fave camera, a PowerShot A650IS, last year, and was told by Canon online that either the G12 or this SX150 would be the equivalent.  This SX150 is a fail. The battery life is short (only 2x AA, not 4), the flip-flash inconvenient (why hide the flash?!), the recycle time after flash is overlong (forget using with kids), no actual viewfinder, the LCD viewfinder does not swivel.  In short, this camera is a disappointment and makes me refrain from taking pictures.  Let me repeat, this camera is so bad I no longer care if I do not take pictures of my kids.The indoor photos are grainy and have a weird yellow-ish tone to them, even with flash.  I cannot determine which of the auto setting are for sports.  The grip area is too small for my hands and the camera is too lightweight to have enough inertia for one-handed use. The flash has some weird timing to it - like it does not really read the distances right.  If the object being photographed is not in the flash area sweet spot, it does not really illuminate well and the contrast gets all messy.The fixed LCD viewfinder is so large it takes up all of the camera interface on the back, leaving barely enough room for the buttons.  I'm sure it contributes to why the battery life is so short.  Why do manufactures insist on such small buttons?! Whoever is the marketer or designer that thinks hiding buttons and keyboards is a good thing should be told that a camera is a tool, not their design-school art project.  I miss the A650 so much more after having this camera.I used to be a real Canon fan, but the ZR500 camcorder (does not play all MiniDV speeds) and this SX150 (lacking key features) have me less of one.Key feature for us are: AA batteries (yes), swivel LCD viewfinder (no), good recycle time between shots (no), Firewire (no) and USB connectivity (yes), 4-conductor 1/8in A/V breakout jack, image stabilization, good actual and digital zoom (yes), and real-world colored pictures (no), and a reasonable price.2/25/2012 update - was trying to use video recording function and batteries lasted only 10 mins.

Impressed by the calrify of pictures and portability to PC. Only drawback is the battery - does not last long enough for a day's trip.""
"20120121","4.0","Great camera","I love this camera. It takes great video and photos. It has the great Canon user interface. Well designed. I love that it uses AA batteries. It does eat them up fast, but that doesn't bother me because with AA's I can just have a set of 4 rechargeables and swap them whenever needed.It has really good manual control features. It would be perfect for me if it had a swiveling LCD screen. It takes up to 15 sec exposures, which is good, but I'd like to have longer. The lens and mechanical stuff seem well made for a cheap point and shoot camera.""
"20120121","5.0","Great little camera","This camera takes beautiful, crisp photos with little effort on my part.  I'm still exploring the functions, however I have every expectation that I'll have no problems figuring it out.  There were many comments about short battery life, however I feel this isn't so much of an issue that I would not give a 5star rating.  As soon as I use up the lithium batteries that I purchased, I will buy a charger and a supply of batteries.  Problem solved!  I like the way there's 'substance' to the camera without being bulky.  I'm not afraid of sitting on it a breaking it, as it doesn't fit in my pocket!Love this camera, would highly recommend it to the casual photographer like me.""
"20120119","4.0","CANON POWER SHOT","I purchased the camera because my Kodak doesn't take very good indoor pictures. Even with a flash from 15' away the pictures are dark. This camera DOES take a pretty good picture even from far across a room with a flash, much better than the Kodak does, but pictures are not really QUITE as bright as I'd like them to be. For what the camera cost, though, it's easy to use and the pictures are pretty good.""
"20120116","3.0","Beware battery life","The camera performs competently for its price point.  The biggest drawback that I see is the battery life: if you put this in video mode and record around 5 minutes, you will have to replace the batteries.  What's good is that it takes standard sized AA batteries.  But it only holds 2 batteries.  Why not make the case slightly larger and hold 4 batteries?""
"20120116","4.0","Good for casual users","I bought this for my 17 year old daughter for Christmas.  She loves everything about it except battery life - it goes through AA's like crazy. I bought a similar Canon model for my older daughter a year ago and she is also happy.  As a fairly advanced photographer, I consider this a good choice for people wanting a bit more than simple point & shoot functionality, but who don't need professional caliber gear. Canon is always a good choice (Nikon too, which I use).""
"20120113","3.0","Great camera but it EATS batteries!!","I bought this camera to take on an overseas backpacking trip where I didn't want to carry my huge Canon 5D DSLR due to its weight and size. The only point-n-shoot camera I have used besides this camera was one of the very first Sony Cybershot cameras back in 2001. I chose this one because it had the best optical zoom (12x) than any of the other Canon PnS cameras I looked at in the same price range. (note: I turn digital zoom off because it is crap on EVERY camera so optical zoom is a huge selling point for me).Let me just say that the size and features of this camera are awesome! It is very light weight and fits into the back pocket of jeans moderately easily (its a little bulky in the pocket but it didn't bother me - there are thinner cameras so if fitting it into a pocket is mandatory and bulkiness will bother you then I don't think I would fully recommend this one). The features of the camera blew me away. I used the automatic settings most of the time (wasn't creating art - just capturing memories) and used the snow and miniature mode a lot. Both modes are awesome and I especially like the miniature mode. Very cool effect!But now the downside... this camera EATS AA batteries. Once you put in a fresh pair of AA batteries, you'll start seeing the low battery indicator flashing on the screen really soon. It really depends on how quickly you take photos to really know how many shots you can take on a single set of batteries. I was touring museums and walking through various cities with it and I would get about 30 to 50 photos before the low battery indicator started flashing on the screen. I am so glad that I took a massive jumbo pack of AA's (36 or 48 pack) or else I would have run out. Not sure if this camera will fit the custom Canon batteries that supposedly last longer than regular batteries. You could buy a bunch of rechargeable batteries but you'll need a lot if you're going to be away from a place where you can charge them frequently.I would recommend getting a similar Canon PnS camera with the same features and modes as this one but with either the custom Canon batteries or one that has better power ratings *IF* you plan on going on extended hikes or to places where carrying additional batteries or recharging batteries is not possible. If you're just going to use this for around the house, in the car, or other casual use then I would recommend it for the features and extended optical zoom alone.""
"20120112","4.0","Enthusiastic Camera","First of all it is almost only camera with AA batteries. If you pretty still at shooting time pictures will be clear.In auto mode in door pictures all ISO 800. In manual mode aperture starts from 4.5 even though on spec it is 3.5.Camera has very good noise control.In general picture quality a little better than 5-6 year old cameras of the same class. Menu navigation is clear and fast. Batteries life as everyone stated unacceptable. Camera came with Panasonic LR6 alkaline batteries which died in one day during menu exploration plus 12 test shoots.Camera can be recommended only for occasional photographer say for weekend trips.From other side with AC adapter it can be used by professionals to make pictures for eBay, passport photos and so forth where manual settings may be useful.USB cable is standard but to download pictures you need to power camera. Olympus or Ricoh powered from USB (its a shame for Canon).Review 1/23/12On Sanyo XX works acceptable time and can stay for some week loaded.Full doc specifies that aperture choice depends on the current zoom.""

The one problem we had is that the batteries that came with the camera didn't last very long. That was no big deal really we just put a couple new ones in and we were back in business.""
"20120111","1.0","SOOOOO BAD","I asked for this camera for Christmas and I couldn't be more disappointed.  While the pictures it takes are fine, the battery life is beyond frustrating.  I get about 10 pictures per set of batteries.  Yes, 10, even while not using the flash. And I also tried rechargable AAs/ That's insane!!  The flash can also be too bright and causes the picture to look washed out.  Forget about taking several shots in a row, the time in between is forever!  I am returning.  I would not reccommend this camera to anyone.""

"20120107","4.0","Great pictures, slow flash, battery eater!","I bought this to replace a 4MP camera, and the difference in picture quality is immediately evident.  This camera takes really nice pictures!  On the 'easy' setting, it's a very simple, very reliable point-and-shoot camera.  The two drawbacks of this camera are the slow flash and the battery life.  The flash needs to 'charge,' which sometimes takes as long as 5-6 seconds.  Try catching your kids playing with a 5 second delay--pretty difficult!  Also, it EATS batteries.  I haven't had a pair of AAs last longer than two sessions of about 20 pictures each and maybe a 1 minute video.  I haven't tried rechargeable batteries yet, but at this rate, they're probably worth it.  I like the camera, and I can live with the drawbacks.  Just be aware--especially for the delayed pictures in low light.""
"20120107","2.0","Great camara but the battery no so good","It is a great camera with a great picture, however the battery is not a great deal, because it runs out so quickly that it is annoying, I just bought like 15 days ago and I have already bought new batteries.""
"20120105","5.0","Excellent camera","The Canon SX150 is a fine digital camera and at the price of around 150 is a steal and since I used some credit card points I got it for free and that just can't be topped. It's my second digital camera after my Kodak C123 Sport,which is fine also but no zoom.I used the Canon during New Year's Eve and got some great pics. My knowledg of photography is from the bad old days of 110 film in a Kodak Instmatic which needs light or flash and always take 2 pics incase you messed up. The fact the Canon is capable of night pics without flash is great. It does tell me to put up the flash, but I don't. The main reason I got this camera is to play with manual controls and zoom. It could be a bridge camera to an SDLR in a year as I learn more about photography, but I am so pleased with the pics I get that I may just stay with what I have.""

Picture quality is fantastic and it is very easy to use. I would reccomend buying a good set of rechargable batteries, I bought a good set and they last forever in the camera. My only complaint is that is takes a while inbetween pictures for the flash to recharge. I would reccomend this camera to anyone whether you are an experienced or new to taking pictures.""
"20120102","2.0","Very disappointed","Reasons for disappointment are many!I was looking for a good replacement camera for one that had electronics failure.  Our daughter has a previous version (SX130) of this camera and she has been pleased with it.  I read the review on Amazon and noted the battery usage issue, but felt I could do well with some rechargeable batteries.  They have done OK.  The quality of photos is what I wanted to have, and ordered accordingly.  However, I was very disappointed with the clarity of about 30-40 percent of the pictures, taken with a wide variety of settings, according to the scenes I was shooting.  I followed the directions sent with the camera, telling me I need to push the shutter button part way to allow the camera to pre-focus for a clear shot.  When I did that, often the shutter just fired, in spite of my light touch on the button.  Really!  (I experimented by taking a series of photographs of the same scene or person to see what the capabilities of the camera were).  Most of these experimental photos were flawed in some way.The most disappointing was when I took the setting recommended by the camera menu and shot that scene.  The scene was usually not clear and the colors were not vivid like I have come to be used to with other cameras, including my daughter's.  I also found that there is no way the shutter is fast enough to capture the grandchildren moving even slightly when the picture was being taken.  I have taken about 300 pictures since I got the camera, shooting in a wide variety of situations (outside scenery, inside group photos, photographs of individuals, photographs of children playing, photos of Christmas present unwrapping times, etc.)  I have had to delete at least 100 because of the way this camera operated.  I cannot recommend this camera to those of you looking for a good point and shoot camera.  It has several quirks that make it difficult to get a good photo, and the pre-focus is something ridiculous when a person is trying to capture anything in a quick manner like often is expected with a point-and-shoot camera.""
"20120101","5.0","Great camera.","This was a present for my wife and she loves it. Great camera. Can be operated fully point and shoot or in manual mode by someone with camera skills.""
"20120101","5.0","Great camera","Great camera for the money. This camera performs better than I expected it to, the features are great and the pictures are even better. It is a super value for the money. If you don't want to spend $600+ on a camera this is the one for you. I highly recommend purchasing 4 rechargeable AA batteries, it takes 2 but burns through batteries pretty quick.""
"20111231","4.0","Replacement","I was amaze at the additional setting in menu editing shots ,my colors. The explanation  is new. To be able to mute when your taking those quick shots, hints and tips,power savings? This is first time I have seen languages.. I'm replacing a SX100 which I loved.There are two problems 1. Battery power drainage  2 . Placement of video button,  when you pick up camera you hit the little red video on Button accidental""
"20111231","5.0","Fantastic camera","I love this camera.  It is NOT a pocket size camera, but it does a fantastic job.  The anti-shake seems to work really well, even in low light.  I was at a hockey game the other night and was able to get sharp, clear photos of the opposite end of the ice easily.  It DOES eat batteries, but I invested in Eneloop rechargeable batteries and I am very pleased with it.""
"20111231","4.0","My experience with the batteries...","Yes, this camera does run the batteries down, but...I have a cheap set of 2000mH nicads, and I just ran about an hour of video and about 40-50 flash pics before the batteries died.  The low battery icon started flashing after maybe 10 minutes of video recording, but then just kept going and going.  When the batteries are really low, it will say 'replace batteries' instead of just having the flashing icon.  So in my opinion this is reasonable battery life for what you get...and the video quality is very good.Meanwhile, it does take several seconds to recharge the flash, which is not an issue unless one wants to take rapid succession flash pics, which most people don't want or need with a point and shoot.It's also nice to have the ability to go shutter priority, aperture priority, or full manual.  I haven't tried taking fast-action shots yet, but am looking forward to trying.  The zoom is impressive at this price point.""
"20111230","3.0","Canon always delivers quality (though I got a lemon, today)","I can't leave a very long review, because the item I received (while cosmetically perfect and new in the box) was defective. It had an electrical fault, which meant that it churned through my first and second sets of new alkaline AA batteries in about fifteen minutes (and ten photos) each - and the third set registered empty the moment I put them in.Be mindful as you read this, that I'm loyal to the Canon brand, and am comparing this machine to what I've used of their cameras in past years. If you're a convert from a brand like Panasonic, you might be rightfully wowed by what Canon delivers in the SX150IS. However, personally, I'm disappointed.Canon has excellent photo quality, and this camera appears to be no exception to that rule. Certainly, this model has more resolution, and therefore less dreaminess in the color quality than my 6 megapixel S3IS model I was so fond of and which was stolen from me last spring in Hawaii. The SX150IS case visually looks very nice: it's matte, rather than glossy - which means that the suave look will last longer. Sadly, however, the camera somehow isn't made in a way that molds to your hand, unlike the S3 series. The SX150 does have a nice weight to it, though - and thus feels very professional (and this probably helps to stabilize panning while taking films).I'm kind of disappointed that camera technology hasn't iterated as quickly in five years as you would expect from computer desktop technology or cell phone tech. Certainly, there are some important improvements to button layout, including dedicated picture review button, and on/off button, and a little bit easier layout of the functions around the wheel. That will no doubt make a huge difference for good in a person's day-to-day use of the camera.Even using a tripod, the quality of the photos at the full extent of the optical zoom is really tawdry; it's almost as if you passed the photo through an 'oil-paint' photoshop filter. There's a reason why people want an optical zoom rather than a digital zoom, and there doesn't seem to be much improvement with this camera.The one really thoughtful bit of engineering that I immediately was impressed with, is that the screen is actually set back half a centimeter - behind a piece of plexiglass which is, itself, flush with the housing. This means that while the plastic (why don't manufacturers ever want to use glass?!) might get scratched up from keys in the pocket, it is protected from any more serious damage.""
"20111230","5.0","Canon power shot","This camera is a pretty good camera. The only problem that I had, was me not getting the batteries that were 'included'. I bought it new, and now I think I got jeffed. But oh well..still a working functional great camera.""
