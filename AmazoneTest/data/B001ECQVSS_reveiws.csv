"20120523","5.0","Better a Late Review Than No Review","I bought two 16GB cards back in 2009 and have been using them without incident for over 3 years.  I purchased the cards for my Canon HF200 video camera and have not had a problem with either card.  They were shipped in Amazon Frustration Free packaging and it was a breeze to get them out of the packaging and into my camera.I have not compared transfer speeds with other cards because this is the only brand I own.  The cards are rated at Class VI, which is no longer the fastest option available so check your device to see what the minimum transfer speed is that it requires.  Transfer speeds vary between the two computers I transfer files to but it is always quick to transfer files, even when the card is full at 16GB.  I have used both cards numerous (100's) times in my video camera and have never suffered from data corruption or stuttering video.One other thing to note, if your computer is more than a few years old, make sure your card reader can handle the high capacity SDHC cards.  Most newer card readers should not have a problem but some older card readers and camera's do not support SDHC cards.For the price these memory cards cannot be beat, I just wish other electronic devices held up as long as these cards do!""

"20091106","1.0","Cip Failed After 6 Weeks - Read Other Reviews","I've had many digital cameras over the last 15 years, with various memory flash cards. This is the first time I've experienced a failure like this. It should not happen.First let me say that static electricity, temperature or mishandling were not an issue.I wanted to download some pictures I took, but some could not be downloaded because 'they did not contain valid jpg data' (which they obviously did contain, because it was generated by a camera). I got off the pictures I could and then ran some simple diagnostic tests on the flash that I have on my pc. It appeared that at least one full erase line was bad. Things then got worse as I ran more tests and then the chip became totally unusable. Couldn't be formatted, nothing.In a flash writing is done in a fairly complicated manner. Where a block of data is actually located is independent of its logical block address and it can really be anywhere on the device. The device maintains a table that it keeps in the flash. Thus if this gets corrupted you are screwed.And you can go from mild problems to complete chip death very quickly. If you ever have problems with corrupt data on a flash get off what good data you can and throw the chip away. That glitch will eventually rotate in to a critical spot to haunt you.So, bottom line,, don't buy this brand. As the other readers comments show, there are a lot of better chips out there. Why take pictures if you can never get them again? Don't risk it.""

"20091019","4.0","High hype, low cost (the joys of freedom)","Now that storage cards are: 1. practically a requirement for anyone who owns a camera, videocam, digital recorder, portable storage device; and 2. a fraction of the price of what they were a couple of years ago while offering more memory and speed in proportion to the reduction in price, the consumer is faced with some difficult decisions.  The cards come in many sizes (physically as well as internal capacity) and grades (at least three levels from most manufacturers).  Currently, Transcend (a brand that has moved to the front ranks in only the past two years) is offering the most bang for the buck (i.e. you may be able to purchase a Sandisk or Kingston card for the same price, but it's practically certain to have a more limited storage capacity and/or be rated at a less 'professional' grade).  Hence, the Transcend 8 GB card with a '6 rating' is understandably attracting a lot of attention.  Should it be?Formerly, the only card I had problems with was Lexar, which has virtually disappeared from the menu.  Recently, the only card that's given me trouble on a couple of occasions has been a Transcend--and one of those instances was a mechanical breakdown (the thumb-drive mechanism would not remain extended and locked in place, preventing me from inserting it into my computer's USB port).So it's a bit of a toss-up.  If you want to save a few bucks and feel secure, get a Kingston; if you want to sleep well at night, get a Sandisk; if you want to take after the 'pros,' going for the best image (visual or aural) humanly thought possible on a tight budget, go for a 'Transcend,' Class 6.  But don't be deceived by the other-worldly brand name 'Transcend': it's still a speck of an object, easily misplaced or lost, and very much part of the finite world, subject to the problems and disrepair of all mortal beings and material things.Supposedly, Transcend's 2 grade is more than adequate for most consumers' needs.  Their 4 grade is recommended for hobbyists shooting movies in high definition.  Their 6 grade is what the pros use.  If you're simply using the card to transport documents, get the cheapest Kingston.  Same holds true for most of the 'smaller' cards (including 4gb cards, which not long ago were considered gargantuan).  If you're picking up a whopper (8, 16, and even more GB's) for making a hi-def movie with sound, it 'may' be worth the added cost to go for any of the aforementioned brands' best card.  (I've heard that Sandisk is the primary maker of cards for all of these brands, so if you own Sandisk stock, its bottom line should not be affected significantly by your choice of brand.)Of course, there's always Sony and its Memory Stick, but now you're beginning to talk higher prices than those commanded by any of the aforementioned brands.

The SD card came in a small UPS envelope and once opened the piece of paper fell out and then the SD card in its little plastic holder came next.  I immediately formatted it in my camera.Once formatted the card itself holds less than 15GB of actual photos (15 Gigs oh no! remember when the largest SD card was 256mb!)I'm not going to go into the technical aspects, I'm certain there are other reviews that go into more technical detail than I will.  I will say that the pictures appear to have better clarity on this card (if that's possible) and the response time seems quicker.  The pictures do download faster from the card reader to the HD.Once I use it more I'll post other things that I notice about it.

"20091002","1.0","Think a little before buying this card","Once upon a time, I was looking to get a larger SD card.  16GB for $40?  Why not?  I might not use all of it, but better more than less.  Following that train of thought, I looked for the fastest 16GB card in the range.  Transcend.  An established company wouldn't put out a lemon, would it?  The 100 or so one star reviews were tempered by the 500 five star ones.  I was feeling lucky, so to speak.  Unfortunately, I was not (mostly).  A week into college, it decided to brick up on me, right after a beach party event.  To its credit, I had taken more than 1000 pictures with it over about three weeks.  Still, $40 down the drain.  I will never trust Transcend again, thus making the warranty useless.Now, my point.  If you're looking at the ratings, 1/6 of the reviews are one star, for one reason or another.  Most likely, you will be part of the group that has no problems.  This card was EXTREMELY fast.  HDTune got 17-20 mb/s consistently.  It had more space than I could have ever filled.  For those lucky people, this card is ideal.  For the minority, this card will be hell.  It has more space than you could fill over a two week cruise, before destroying every one of the pictures.  Personally, I count myself lucky in that respect.  All that was lost was a sunset event.  But think: do you want to take that gamble with your precious memories?  Do you?""

I purchased the camera and the card specifically to take pictures at my parent's 50th wedding anniversary party and of my son's football games.  I took pictures at the party - turned out great as I reviewed them on the camera.  I then took pictures of my son's first highschool football game - again, reviewed, great pictures.  When I took it for its 3rd use at my son's second highschool football game after taking pictures of 3 quarters of the game, my camera would not take pictures anymore.  I assumed the memory was full, but got a message that said Card is not formatted.  I thought that was odd, but nothing to worry about - WRONG!!!  I returned home and my son and I anxiously awaited the viewing of the photos.  When we tried to review them in the camera it would keep giving me the same memory card not formatted message.  My daughter took the memory card, after trying to upload the pictures to the computer, to her photography teacher.  He claims there is nothing we can do about it, that the pictures are not recoverable.  I am devastated and heartbroken.  My two sisters and I planned that Anniversary Party for over a year.  We had a terrific turnout, and the place looked beautiful.  I lost pictures of our guests, my parents, friends, relatives, cake cutting, toasting, the grandchildren's special dance for our parents, everything.  Not to mention my son's tackles and his friends touchdown last night which I assured him I had captured.  I don't know what to do.  When my daughter called me here at work, I started to cry.  I cannot believe that a company would put out a product that has failed for so many people and not realize the impact it has on its customers.

This is then inserted, with a small paper pamplet, into a sturdy, sealed, plain, flat cardboard sleeve measuring 8' x 8' making a package size totaling about 3/8' x 8' x 8'.Ready to ship, right? Just affix a label and ship it. WRONG!Next step: Amazon puts two of these shippable packages into a cardboard box measuring, now get this, 3-1/2' x 10' x 12-1/2' with all that excess space filled in with unecessary bubble-wrap.Note! The two original packages total 48 cubic inches, the box they came in equals 437.5 cubic inches, over 9 times the volume.Now to the good part (or should I say the frustrating part): I called Amazon just to let them know how foolish this is, since I actually spent a little extra for minimal packaging materials in an effort to care for our environment, and by the time I got off the phone after two calls to them I was not only frustrated, but I was downright angry.So, with that being said, 'Frustration-Free Packaging' BOO! --- 'Transcend SDHC cards' HOORAY!I'm sure the Transcend SDHC cards will work just fine for a long time to come.

I was told that the bigger flash cards cause all kinds of trouble like not being able to access photos and losing data. I have had no problems at all with this 16GB card. It works like a charm and is fast with data transfer as I have been making movies with no sticking or stopping for data transfer reasons.

Bottom line my credit card had neen renewed and it had a new expiration date, so when that didn't match with my card on file Amazon just deleted my order. I had to call CS and they were no help at all. I had to go back to Amozon on-line, update my expiration date and place a new order.

"20090824","4.0","Great Card","This is one heck of a good card given its speed (6mb/s). This is a time where 'the price is right' I recently bought an 'Extreme' 8 Gig memory card (30 mb/s) and was very happy with it. I figured I would buy the Transcend Card because it was inexpensive and would make a good back up card. I have a Nikon D90 which has a decent frame rate of 4.5 fps. I was very pleased when I found the Transcend was able to keep up with the camera at least up to a point. I was able to fire about 20 shots without any slow down compared to my 30mb/s card. The 30 mb/s card obviously was able to handle longer runs of multiple frame shots but it's rare that you are going to shoot more than 5 or 10 shots in a row.It comes down to value for the buck. I spent 80 dollars for the 8gig 30mb/s card and only a little over 12 for the 8gig 6mb/s Transcend. This is a time where the loss of speed is not noticable enough to worry about when taking normal vs. action photography. If I was shooting a sports event the Transcend would still do pretty well considering its ability to buffer the shots. If you run movies the card is able to handle the movie mode (at 24 fps) without any slow down.This is a good deal for sure. I was a happy man when I checked it out and found the speed loss was insignifigant. I consider this amazing given the Extreme is rated at 30 mb/s and the Transcend is running at 6mb/s!!  I will probably buy a few more for the 12 dollar price ! I am very pleased for a product at a very good price that performs much better than expected.""

Not sure why some reviewers are having problems other than 1. be sure to format the cards using the camera prior to using 2. not the card but the card reader issue when WinXP not recognizing? 3. bad quality control by Transcend?

After a year, it failed and died.  Of course, this happened after I had shot 80+ priceless photos of a memorable and emotional event.  I've tried various software packages for photo recovery, and have also sent it off to a professional.  It is corrupted beyond repair and no photos can be recovered.  The other cards we own are Kingston and SanDisk brands.  My children have used them for multiple devices, many times, and they are all older than this card.  We've experienced no problems.

I've taken about 20k pictures each on two of the cards, and they've been great... If you're wondering, my 12.3mp Nikon D90, shooting in Raw format will fill this card in about 530 photos, or in 'normal jpeg', in about 2100, although I usually only shoot in Raw (or NEF, same thing). No failures, cheap price, easy transfers with the Transcend reader: 5 stars.Edit: October 24th: I've had a card fail, luckily after I'd pulled all my pictures off, and I've been very gentle with them. I did delete a few photos in camera in that particular card, which you're not supposed to do, so I'm guessing it's my fault too, but I've since ponied up for SanDisk Extreme III's with recovery software. These are pretty good cards, and they hold a lot, but I think with the chances of something going wrong and having up to 8gigs of shots on it is scary. I got these for $8 each though, so it's still been a great deal in my book. Just be gentle with 'em...""

(Ever slice open a finger on that stuff once you've created a sharp edge along the cut you had to create with a broad axe to get it open?)However...the two Transcend cards came in a box big enough to ship a live animal.  There was the box, which was about 12'x12'x6', which was stuffed full of paper, then the cards were in a (something like an 8'x8') cardboard sleeve that was quite stiff (it likely could have been the shipping pack with very little added protection)....all this for two SDHC cards which, when set side-by-side, are still smaller than a credit card.The product arrived unharmed (with that much box around it, they could have only arrived damaged if shipped by catapult...and even then...), and the price was extremely competitive of course.Very satisfied, but hoping the packaging could be toned down a little from an ecological standpoint...though it is all recyclable.""

About 25% of the time when I turned the camera on the 'Format' screen on the LCD popped up asking if I wanted to format the card. I selected 'No' and pushed the  o.k. button. Unfortunately, this did not get rid of the screen. I had to turn the camera off and on once, twice, or three times to get rid of the screen. It also happened sometimes during a shooting session. At first I thought that I had a defective camera. After using the card for a couple of days and still having the same problem I decided to try the other card. Using this second card solved the problem and it hasn't happened again after several days of using it. I went back and  read the negative reviews and decided that the quality control by the manufacturer isn't very good. I'm going to send both of them back and order a couple of Sandisk SDHC cards.""

"20090801","5.0","Keeping me out of prison!","Recently I took up photography after getting out of prison. The camera was actually a gift from my probation officer Carl, he said that if I stayed busy doing constructive stuff like painting and drawing I wouldn't return to my days as a Ganja smuggling low life. After spending a few days pushing around a paint brush Carl realized I lacked the motor skills necessary to draw a drunken stick figure. So in his next visit he brought me some bizarre camera with a television screen tied to the back in place of a view finder. Fast forward a few days and I ran out of film. So I went to get it developed. I handed what I believe to be called a memory card to clerk, and returned two hours later. The clerk gave me back the photos and the memory card (I guess it is a negative?).  It was a relief to see the photo shoot of my kittens in an ice cream truck turned out well. One photo actually made it look as if Cheech was driving the truck while Chong was eating.But now I was without film so I ran a search the INTERNET for SD card like my recently senile neighbor suggested. The results of the search returned a chat with some sexy singles and about a zillion of these cards. I noticed this one came without frustrations; I don't really see the point in paying extra for frustrations if I already have more than enough as it is. The card came with a small case to carry the film. It is about the size of a partially smoked eighth perhaps a teener. This is a 4gb card which I guess means it is good for like 400 pictures (compared to the 24 in a 35mm film). I'm not sure how they fit that many frames of film into a small card. I assume it works a little like Doctor Who's PoliceBox. I noticed with this card you can review your pictures and even delete them.I am a little worried that if I delete a picture it will create some trippy double exposure effect which will raise the eyebrow of Craig who has taken such a liking my photography that he has yet to notice that the green light above my shower adjacent to the toilet he frequents is part of my hydroponic lab.So far I have gone through ten of these cards. Maybe I will try a Sandisk extreme but judging by the name it is marketed to the pornography industry. I have gone through six or seven of these cards, I throw them out after making them into prints. I am a little interested in opening this card up but am worried about disrupting the time space continuum. After all I never really cared much for Back to the Future, why would I want to live it?""

I unfortunately only recently discovered this  in the middle of my vacation to Costa Rica. At first, it seemed to be working fine. Pictures saved and I was ecstatic to have a 2000 picture capacity. Everything was nice until I actually went to review the pictures. Many were intact and displayed well, but several and coincidently the best pictures were completely corrupted. I couldnt view them on the camera which displayed a question mark and I couldnt open them when I transferred them to the computer. I first thought this was simply the characteristic of the horrible JPEG file format but I decided to give JPEG the benefit of the doubt and do a  test on the card. I used it to take 10 more photos. I then went to review them. One of the ten was corrupted from the start. But with each review (opening the file), more and more seemed to become corrupted. I then used my other cards and did the same test, experiencing none of the problems. Im pretty pissed off that an eighth of my vacation photos (and coincidently some of the best ones) are completely messed up because of this card.

I suspect one of the banks on the flash failed taking about a quarter of my images with it.My experience does not seem to be unique. Unfortunately, I didn't read the other reviews before I placed my order. I have an 8GB Transcend SDHC which has worked flawlessly for over a year, so I thought I could extrapolate form that experience :-(Hopefully, I'll be able to get my money back.

"20090514","5.0","Great card for affordable price","I've had a couple of these for a while now and after shooting hundreds of pictures, downloading to my computer and deleting them from the card (several times), I've not had a single hitch.  I shoot most pictures in RAW+JPEG mode with a 15MP camera, so it's nice to know I can still take a lot of pictures before having to swap out cards.For those who have had problems, I feel your pain, and realize it could happen to me any day.  I have two suggestions for anyone dealing with photo memory cards.1)  Always have extras on hand, not only to increase the number of photos you can shoot, but also in case one isn't working.2)  If you discover that you can't read your images off your card, before doing anything else with it, get hold of some good memory card file recovery software (I've heard Lexar Image Rescue works well for any brand of card) and your chances of recovering most or all of your images is quite good.Realize also that it might not be the card that screwed up, but your camera.  It can be difficult to know which was the culprit.  These kinds of glitches happen with all technology - the key is to be prepared in case it happens to you.""

DO YOUR RESEARCH, you don't want to have to deal with data downloading while trying to capture consecutive shots.

And it was awesome because I personally never knew that's how you're supposed to cut it open (cut along the edge)!  It saved me a LOT of pain that's for sure.That said, the card itself is excellent.  I'm using it with my Panasonic Lumix TZ5 digital camera.  It went in and even without formatting, i was able to take photos immediately.  I did format, though, in case there are any problems in the future.

"20090326","4.0","Transend 4GB SDHC tested in a Fujifilm FinePix Z10fd","First as always, I tested the card with H2testw to make sure the card had the capacity advertised. I have discovered more often than not that SDHC cards purchased on eBay tended to be bogus. That is, they were 2 cards that had been hacked to appear as 4 GB. But when information is written and verified by H2testw, certain sectors with information are overwritten because the sectors overlap in order to seem bigger than they are, thus the write verification fails. But not the Transend I purchased from Amazon.Not only did the Transend pass with flying colors, but the read-write speed really impressed me. Of course, you need a fast card reader-writer and USB 2.0 to get an accurate reading of the speed.The next crucial test was when I inserted the card in my little Fujifilm FinePix Z10fd, which is small enough to accompany me nearly anywhere. I found the time movies took to be written to the card was nearly nil. I didn't have to worry about my camera memory buffer overflowing when I made a movie for myself or for YouTube.Amazon had a good buy on this Transcend card, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a class 6 SDHC 4 GB card.""

I don't have experience with any other brand, so I don't know if this is a common problem with flash memory cards in general.

"20111008","5.0","revIEW","I was thinking why do we exist, I came up with this. Pikaia survived the Burgess decimation.This response does not cite a single law of nature; it embodies no statement about predictableevolutionary pathways, no calculation of probabilities based on general rules of anatomy orecology. The survival of Pikaia was a contingency of just history. I do not think that anyhigher answer can be given, and I cannot imagine that any resolution could be more fascinating.We are the offspring of history, and must establish our own paths in this most diverse andinteresting of conceivable universes-one indifferent to our suffering, and therefore offeringus maximum freedom to thrive, or to fail, in our own chosen way.My contention to your preposterous rhetoric regarding our very existence in which we thriveas a single minute unit which are completely devouring and deteriorating the very core towhat enabled us to evolve into the intellectual beings we are today, is that evolution itselfis a physically forced change that occurs as our environments dramatically revolutionize intocompletely different atmospheric living conditions further in time altering our internalgenetic codes to either acclimate to these conditions or become extinct. Furthermore, Ibelieve that we are the offspring of evolution brought here by matter in space from otherplanets molecules containing living extraterrestrial enzymes that lived within the meteors,dust and debris through the actual violent fruition that joined for the creation of thisvery planet in which we now live.Even those who have observed the sawtooth pattern of fluctuation between emergence anddestruction, further emergence and still further destruction, and who have already chartedthe eventual end of the universe, are half agreed that there is a stubborn tendency towardan upward progression. This is no great surprise: inefficient creatures will either die outor be destroyed by more successful ones. But progress does not negate the idea of randomness,and when he came to examine the Burgess shale, the great paleontologist Stephen Jay Gouldarrived at the most disquieting and unsettling conclusion of all. He examined the fossilsand their development with minute care and realized that if this tree could be replanted orthis soup set boiling again it would very probably not reproduce the same results that we now know.These spoken observations were inexorably observed by individual scientific voyagers whothrived on premeditated assumptions which may have lead to misrepresented results basedsolely in favor of their particular hypothesis on the subject matter. It is inevitablethat the consumption of natural resources being removed from the planets core will unavoidablycreate further unstable conditions and extreme changes to the stability of the survivabilityfor not only life itself, but the life of the planet. In the momentum we have been acceleratingin with this internal destruction, we can be certain that it will surely lead to mankind'sdemise and possibly paving the way for a new planetary evolution as with the dinosaurs.Probably the most daunting task we face, as partly rational animals with adrenal glands thatare far too big and prefrontal lobes that are far too small, is the contemplation of our ownrelative weight in the scheme of things. Our place in the cosmos is so unimaginably smallthat we cannot, with our miserly endowment of cranial matter, contemplate it for long at all.No less difficult is the realization that we may also be quite random as presence on earth.I do concur with the inability for the traditional homosapian's mental capacity's comprehensionincapable of understanding the possible unimaginable minuteness in the cosmos and as mentionedprior, share a random presence similar to that of which the disambiguational creatures thatonce roamed on the very soil we walk known as the dinosaurs, which alike, we will face ourdemise in a different way and most likely by our own arrogance and planetary abuse.In the occasion that one may discover themselves in a situation that they are unaware of,no immediate action would be essential at that instance due to the deficiency of comprehensionof the circumstances at hand.

The D90 has a small internal memory that can hold a few pictures at a time. On my old card, I always have had problems waiting to catch up to writing to the card.

By far the best deal for a 16GB SDHC I found when looking!One problem you might anticipate when trying to use the SDHC as a boot drive is that the default ubuntu fstab does something weird... I think it tries to mount the SDHC as a read-only cdrom or something.

"20110921","3.0","At least it is cheap...","I bought this product and found out quickly that the locking mechanism is easily switched.  Whenever i would put it into my camera it would switch it to lock mode.  Impeding me to take pictures or to delete pictures.  After about 3 tries of putting the card in, it would finally not lock.  This would happen every time that I would take the card out and try to put it back in.  Other then the locking mechanism, I like the memory card.""
"20110921","5.0","Good","Works well for a memory card I mean it's not something to get out of your chair over, but it works great and I use it with my D10 underwater camera.""
"20110920","1.0","Card failure","I bought a brand new nikon 5100.  I have literally been using this card for 4 days.  Learning the camera and had about 200 photos.  All of a sudden it reads 'This memory car cannot be used. Card may be damaged. Insert another card.'  My computer can't detect any of the photos.  I can't imagine if I was in the middle of something actually important.  I would not recommend this card.""
"20110919","1.0","Mine just failed me too!","As with many other posters, I have been using these 16 gb class 6 Transcend cards since about 2009.  Suddenly, without warning, at a family occasion, my camera went black with the message 'memory card error', followed by 'card is locked'.  All attempts to unlock the card and continue photographing failed.  Attempts to download to 2 separate computers, running special software supposed to retrieve lost and damaged cards have all failed.  It is as if it deleted itself entirely without warning.  In fact, it freezes up the camera function now as long as it remains inserted.  Beware.  I have others of this kind with important photos on them also.  It leaves me thinking now that this brand cannot be trusted 100% when I have an important occasion to photograph.""
"20110919","5.0","Yup, works great","Not much to say about this one. It works perfectly and has outlasted 2 cameras now. Even on a 10 mega pixle camera I get like 1400 shots.Good:-Lots of capacity!Bad:-I've gotten really lazy about downloading the cameraSummary:-Just buy it""

This card was recommended as a card to work well with the Canon and was being sold as an add on. I read a review of a guy who it worked well for with this camera. Well when I got it it wouldn't work with any of 3 Canon cameras. It kept giving error messages and also wanted to be formatted. I did format it a number of times with no success. I was asked to rate the Company I purchased the card from ,Eke Technology ,and to email them before I would leave any bad feedback. I emailed them about 4 weeks ago and no answer. So Im forced to report that they seem to be a bad , unreliable company that apparently will not stand behind their products. Now Im stuck with a card that will not work and lost my money.""

"20090122","1.0","*** DO NOT USE THIS CARD ON CANON HF10 ***","I bought this Transend card for my Canon HF10. I have used it a lot, but never filled it up, always retrieved the video to HD, all seemed ok.When I went to Disney Wold, I set my camera to record on this card fisrt, then the internal memory. At about 7GB, the camera stopped recording and showed the 'initialize the card with the camcorder' message. First time I have seen this. I could no longer even view the contents.I switched to the internal memory, plus filled another 8 GB Kingston with no issues.I came home, put the Transend card in to the reader, nothing. The PC prompts me to format it. Neither the camera nor the reader can access it. I lost one day's worth of video from Disney. I suspected something was wrong with it, so was able to retake some of the video (safari is gone though), bummer...Now, is it the camera or the card? Hard to say but I suspect the card, because I have other cards (kingston and sandisk) and they never gave me a problem like that.I wonder if the saying 'you get what you pay for' came true with this one.I can no longer take chances with this brand, and it will go into the garbage.I suggest you pay a little more for a better brand to have peace of mind.""
"20090122","5.0","Trancend 8GB SD card","These SD cards are a bargain, I was a bit worried that my camera or laptop would not recognize them but both my old X60 IBM and Nikon D60 saw them and used them without any problem.  I have had no issues with transfer speeds or anything else.""
"20090122","5.0","Great 16GB card .... when you get it.","I have a Canon SX 10 IS and a FS100 Camcorder.  The card fits into both.  I initially started with the SX 10 but a TV guy told me that Video Cameras even on the LOW END were superior to Still Cameras with Video ability.  I thought the Video from the SX10 was good.  He was correct.  The camcorder produces VASTLY SUPERIOR video.  Since I want my singers to be seen in the best possible way, I now use the Camcorder and the SX10 as a backup for video.  This card can hold more info that the camcorder can shoot on a single battery charge.  IT DOES NOT COME WITH A CASE.  Let me repeat that.  IT DOES NOT COME WITH A CASE.  I did not know that before I ordered the 2nd card (4 days later and it still has not been shipped.  I have been spoiled by NewEgg.  They never take more than 3 days FOR IT TO ARRIVE!!!!)  AND IT TOO WILL HAVE NO CASE.  Hopefully I will will find some cases some where.  The next ones that I order (and I will order 2 more) MUST have a case.  ALL in ALL I really like the card.  I 100% recommend it.  I already have a mini card reader or I would have ordered the one that came with the card reader.""

"20090122","5.0","Flawless, Fast, and Affordable","After using this card for over 6 months every day for photos, videos, and the occasional file transfer, this Class 6 (fastest transfer speed currently available) 8 GB SDHC card from Transcend has worked flawlessly.I have never had one missed photo or corrupt video recording.  I couldn't ask for more. And the price is tough to beat.When it became time to purchase another SDHC card, I immediately went with this same Transcend card.  I also have a more expensive SanDisk Extreme III 8 GB SDHC card.  I have not noticed any difference in speed or quality.  Comparing prices, the choice was easy.  I went with Transcend.This is also my first experience with Amazon.com Frustration-Free Packaging.  I LOVE IT!

"20090121","3.0","Beware of Compatability Issues","I initially sang the praises of this little card. But that was when I used it with my Coolpix L18 camera. It gave plenty of room to take loads of pics, or about 20 minutes of video. However, my Canon PowerShot S2 will NOT read the card, and I'm having problems with my HP computer reading it also. Currently, my grandaughter's baptism is 'locked' in this SD card because of these issues. The only way I can watch the video is on the Nikon Coolpix camera.I can be a great card, but make sure it will be compatible with ALL of your electronics before you actually need it to work for a special occasion.""

ALONG WITH ALL THIS YOU HAVE THE GREAT 8 GIG CAPACITY OF THE CARD WHICH IS AWESOME FOR BURST AND VIDEO MODES. IF YOU NEED A CARD WITH HIGH CAPACITY AND HIGH READ SPEED, THIS IS THE CARD FOR YOU.

What can I say, so far, the card works wonderfully and even Best Buy and other stores don't have SD cards this big yet.  They only had 8GB when I looked and they wanted as much as a 16GB here on Amazon.Like all SD cards, the back side's vertical, blue plastic pieces are delicate.  I wouldn't use these, or any SD cards, in a card reader.  Just plug your camera into the USB directly to transfer images, much safer for the card.Great deal!""

Luckily I got the machine to boot and run long enough to back up her data.She needed a backup plan, but I didn't expect her to have the discipline to maintain a backup plan involving an external drive.  So I had the idea to get her a big enough SD card to hold her documents, favorites, etc.  She's not a photographer or videographer so the 8GB was plenty.We plugged this card into the built in card reader, set up Microsoft's Sync Toy and now she shouldn't have to worry about losing her data again.  At least it's better than no backup at all.I didn't measure the performance of the card, but it is plenty fast for backup and was at a great price for 8GB.

"20081218","3.0","Good and Bad","I purchased 2 of these to have one as backup and as it turns out, I needed the backup one after taking only about 20 pictures with the first one in a time period of about a half hour. The card 'jammed' and I cannot format it or access any of the pictures taken. There are bad cards in the bunch and it seems to be few and far between but be wary. As a result I'm not comfortable using these on my upcoming vacation and will be purchasing a more dependable brand card instead. The other card is performing well...so far. Write speed is fast, transfer speed is fast as well and the seemingly countless pictures it can hold (using w/ panasonic FZ28) is very nice indeed. However, as a result of the other card malfunctioning, I make sure to dowload pictures daily to minimize loss of data should this card fail on me as well. eektechnology was quick to reply to my email and offered to exchange it 'if' after their testing they deem it defective. Otherwise they will return it and deduct a 20% restocking fee from my refund. For only having paid $7 on Black Friday it's not worth it for me to pack this up and ship it back to them for a refund (I would have to pay for the shipping!). I'll just cut my losses on this one and hope the next brand works better. Good luck to you should you choose to go ahead and get one.""

"20081125","4.0","A great buy, but....","there's just a few caveats.First, be aware that the card does NOT come with a case. This may or may not matter to you, but it seems like deception by omission that no one informs you. I bought this card along with the 4 GB card for my DSLR, and it ended up being a serious issue for me, since I can only have one card in my camera at a time, and the other card is left unprotected.Second, the 8GB card is oh-so-slightly thicker than other SD cards (the 4GB is fine). This means that it gets stuck in SD card slots (or at least, it does on my Canon XSi), but all it takes is a little pushing and jiggling, and it comes out every time.Finally, be aware that although it is rated Class 6, it isn't quite as fast as the pricier alternatives. I had never encountered a delay when shooting in burst, but when I used the Transcend cards, my camera was incapacitated for a good 10 seconds after shooting a burst of 8 shots or so.However, even with these issues in mind, I thought the card was an excellent purchase. At one point, Amazon offered this same card with a memory card reader for only a dollar more, which would have been the ultimate deal, but I'll settle for this. It works, it's cheap, and I would certainly recommend it.Still, I've only had the card for about a month, and you never know about quality......""

On Sunday, through USPS!?! LIARS!! I am stuck paying the highway robbery price of shipping anyways, so I send them a complaint email, through amazon, that I am still waiting on a response from them. Oh, and did I mention, that then 3 days later on Wed. 10/1/08 I get another email from them telling me my items had actually now shipped! Irony really setting in now, that I had received all other ordered items now except the one I paid the most for...I could have canceled my order and stopped this rip-off from happening.

I let it sit around for about two months.This weekend I went to use it, and it wasn't recognized by either the Zen or the computer. I've tried several tests to see if the problem was on the end of the computer/mp3 player, but the issue seems to be with the card. It must be a dud.I have to dig up my receipt and see if I kept any packaging. it's too late to return this to Amazon, so I'll see what Transcend has to offer, if anything. It's disappointing to not be able to rely on such a purchase when I most needed it. Now I probably have to go to a local shop and see if I can find something that compares, although I know it will be hard to get as good a deal for this much storage.**** UPDATE *****It's been a couple weeks since I tried using this card. On a whim, I decided to try it again, and this time it worked - my computer found it and so did my mp3 player! Strange! I'll cross my fingers and hope it continues to work after this. It would be a shame to start storing a lot of music or other files on it and then lose it all.""

And then, it was gone.  Took out an reloaded, nothing. Put back into my camera (Nikon D5000 ) error message, card defective!

"20080917","5.0","Excellent SDHC Card at Unbeatable Price","I purchased this card to use in my MP3 player (one of the Insignia models from Best Buy).  Having bought into the Sandisk hype for years, I decided the substantially lower cost of the Transcend made it worth a try.  It works great and the class 6 speed is very fast compared to slower cards.  The lifetime warranty can't be beat.I've used it for 6 months with no issues at all.  I'm so impressed that I'm buying another to upgrade the smaller 2Gb card in my wife's Nikon D40.  The price on this card fluctuates, so with a little patience you can get it less than $20 (Fall 08).As others have commented, please note that this card is a high capacity (SDHC) card.  It is not compatible with every SD device in existence.  Do your homework before you buy to make sure your device and/or card reader works with SDHC cards.  Don't assume!Bottom line:  Highly recommended for devices that accept SDHC cards.""

"20110706","3.0","Transcend 4GB SDHC card","This memory card was purchased as part of a Amazon camera gift bundle, at a very attractive add-on price. My much later study of reviews suggests that there may be real reliability issues with this model, so I need to warn my gift recipient to be careful about one-in-a-lifetime shots.  However, the card has so far behaved absolutely normally -- it was immediately recognized by the camera, and the camera was able to quick-format it successfully.  I then took and reviewed several pictures, and deleted one, all with no problems.  The data were recorded on the card with almost no detectable lag.  My biggest complaint thus far is the bubble packaging used by Transcend -- it is just plain hard to open, and there is no small plastic case included to protect the card if you want to carry it around as a spare.  I guess that low price has a cost.  But uncertainty about long-term reliability remains the biggest worry.  So far, all is good.""

But do not get one unless you also get a new (or have a) compatible SDHC USB card reader.I very often use both film and picture mode when I use my new camera, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5A: (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011Z6D9U/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title).Recording film fills up a lot of space on the memory card, and buying an 8GB card allows me to use both modes frequently. I filled this card in 3 busy weeks of vacation! Only about 400 pictures, the rest was film.Using the camera to transfer pictures to the computer took hours! Using a new SDHC-compatible card reader made the transfer to an even older computer many times faster! it took less than half an hour compared to over three h by the cable that came with the camera.Without timing the seconds and minutes exact, I guess the difference is between 6-10 times using a proper card-reader to any older built in USB access.  Go for the card, but get a proper card-reader and good luck.""

"20080703","5.0","Excellent performance, solid compatability","I purchased this SDHC, Class 6 card for my new Canon G9 about 4 months ago because I needed a high-speed SDHC card for the new camera. Since getting it, I have ended up swapping it between the Canon G9 and my SD800, depending on if I was going to an event with point-and-shoot requirements or if I could sling the G9 around my neck and use it.The performance so far has been excellent, I've fired off a 45-second sequence of continuous shots on my G9 (10MP camera) before at a wedding and the card has no problem writing all that out and just letting me keep holding down the button and firing off shot after shot. When you consider the raw amount of bytes the camera is processing and writing during a continuous-shot session, it's pretty dang impression that it's writing out so many MB/sec.The SD800, at 6MP, performs swimmingly as well but the real performance bar to clear was the G9, which it handles with ease. Also swapping the card between cameras in the middle of shooting sessions has never been a problem as the card seems to be compatible with all my SD-based Canons without issue. I've never had to reformat the card or anything like that.The 'no brainer' attribute of purchasing this card is the combination of performance, compatibility and price... you could buy 4 of these things and just swap them in and out if you are a serious photographer.I get 600-800 shots at 10mp on a single card at about 4-6mb each picture so I really can't imagine you needing more than one of these unless you were a professional photographer shooting at like 12 or higher MP with a trigger finger. But in that case you probably want to play it safe and use more cards, incase any 1 of them has a failure.That was a tip I heard from some photographer friends; that you never want to buy bigger than a 4GB card incase you fill it up and it fails, then you loose hundreds and hundreds of pictures at one time. So in most cases having a few 4GB cards seems to be the sweet spot between safety and convenience.""

The cards are very fast and I have not had any issues with compatibility.One note, if you have an SD card reader it may not be able to read this type of card (SDHC).  You will probably need to purchase a specific SDHC reader.  I bought an 8gb Transcend SDHC card with a reader.  It works fine on a Macbook Pro, Windows PC, and a the Linux-based Asus EEE PC.""

"20080522","5.0","excellent card for HF100","I bought this recently for my Canon HF100. This card works fine with that camcorder (i.e. I can record at the highest quality possible - 17Mbps). The thing to note though is HF100 does not really require a card this fast (i.e. Class 6). It requires only Class 4. But then, this card currently is available for about the same price (or less) as any other Class 4 card.. So go ahead and buy this - it works as advertized.Also about the capacity, for the battery that comes with HF100, there is no significant benefit buying one 16GB Vs 2 of 8GB cards (right now, 2 8GB cards go for $10 less than a 16GB). This is because the battery lasts only about an hour, and an 8GB card is perfect to record video at highest quality setting for slightly over 1 hour. So if you arent planning to buy an additional battery (which is $90 now, because it is too new), I would say get this (or some other) 8GB card. By the time the price for the battery comes down, the 16GB cards would have come down even further, so you can buy 16GB card at that time.""

The transfer rate from the card to my computer is a whole lot faster than an older, slower 1 Gig card I was using.I have a SLR camera and tested this card against my slower card and the picture taking/recording rate was about the same.  I think the newer DSLR cameras have a buffer so the speed of the card really doesn't affect the speed at which a few pictures are taken.However, with a lot of pictures on the card, it's nice to have a fast transfer rate when I'm copying the pictures to my hard drive.The 8 Gig storage is great.  I can store over 2,000, 10.2 megapixel pictures on the card.""

This one works just fine for me in my Sanyo Xacti CG6 hybrid video/digicam. No problems for me. I should note that the CG6 is NOT an HD resolution camera - 640 x 480 only.One point to keep in mind, and I knew this before I bought it but didn't think about it until after, is that these high capacity (>2mb) SD cards are not readable using older card readers. I can't use it in my portable card reader or in the built-in card reader on my 3 year old computer. I must connect the camera to a USB port in order to copy files from this card to my computer.""

If you're in the market for an affordable high quality SDHC card, this may be the one for you. Sorry, I kind of sounded like a used car salesman right there, didn't I? I assure you that I don't work for Transcend. But, here's why I think this card is awesome:Pros:-Affordable!-Large 8GB capacity-Class 6 read/write speed (which is the fastest speed currently available)-Lifetime warranty (at least that's what the package says :)-Transcend is a reputable company that's been making memory products for a very long time. ( I swear to the tech Gods that I don't work for them!)Cons:- I can't think of any right now. The closest thing to a 'Con' that I can think of is that if you buy this card now, it will probably become cheaper in a month or so :) No, make that 2 weeks.IMPORTANT SPECIAL NOTES ABOUT SDHC MEMORY CARDS:-SDHC cards are not compatible with most older SD cameras, SD devices, or SD card readers.-SDHC cards are rated by speed using different 'classes'. There are currently three data transfer speed classes available for SDHC cards. These classes are 'class 2, class 4, and class 6'. For example, 'Class 2' would have the slowest read/write speed while 'Class 6' has the fastest read/write speed. So if you have a device in which speed may play a crucial role, make sure you buy a higher 'class' SDHC card. Again, this SDHC card has the fastest read/write speed available right now. Class 6 has a minimum read/write speed of 6mb/sec... while Class 2 has minimum speed rating of 2mb/sec, and Class 4 is 4mb/sec. Starting to see the pattern?SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'SD CARDS' AND 'SDHC CARDS?SDHC is basically an upgrade to the older SD cards. The reason they upgraded it was to achieve greater data transfer speeds AND capacity than previously possible with normal SD cards... and to do this, they had to redesign the card (which is why it's not compatible with normal SD devices). This was necessary because digital cameras and digital video cameras these days have higher resolutions, which equate to larger file sizes and faster data transfer needs.I hope I haven't confused everybody by going into this much detail, but I can't help being the nerd that I am. If you are confused, don't hesitate to comment on this post and I will try my best to answer your questions. Also, any feedback is always welcome!Conclusion: Buy the card if you have a new device that uses SDHC. It rocks! (This message has been approved by the 'Duke of New Mexico')""

But, here's why I think this card is awesome:Pros:-Affordable!-Large capacity-Class 6 read/write speed (which is very fast... but is no longer the fastest class available)-Lifetime warranty (at least that's what the package says :)-Transcend is a reputable company that's been making memory products for a very long time. ( I swear to the tech Gods that I don't work for them!) Other reputable and reliable memory card companies include Kingston and PNY. All three of these companies have been making memory chips for many, many years.Cons:- I can' really think of any 'Cons' about this card. But here's the 2 closest things I can come up with right now:  (1) 'Class 6' is no longer the fastest speed available and (2) This card does NOT make coffee for you in the morning, do your dishes for you, give you compliments when you're having a bad day, or magically improve your photography skills.IMPORTANT SPECIAL NOTES ABOUT SDHC MEMORY CARDS:-SDHC cards are not compatible with most older SD cameras, SD devices, or SD card readers.-SDHC cards are rated by speed using different 'classes'. There are currently 4 data transfer speed classes available for SDHC cards. These classes are 'class 2, class 4, and class 6, and the new class 10. For example, 'Class 2' would have the slowest read/write speed while 'Class 10' currently has the fastest read/write speed.  So if you have a device in which speed may play a crucial role, make sure you buy a higher 'class' SDHC card. Please note that this SDHC card no longer has the fastest read/write speed available. There is now a new class, called 'Class 10'.  Class 6 has a minimum read/write speed of 6MB/sec... while Class 2 has minimum speed rating of 2MB/sec, and Class 4 is 4MB/sec. Starting to see the pattern?-SDHC cards are not only for digital cameras. Any device that is compatible with SDHC cards should work with this card. Just make sure that it takes a full-sized SDHC card.  For example, there are some devices that use smaller cards... like Micro-SDHC or Mini-SDHC.  If you have a Micro-SDHC or Mini-SDHC card already and want to use it in a full sized SDHC device, you can buy an adapter that can make those cards larger so that they can fit into a full sized SDHC card slot. However, you cannot make a full size SDHC card fit into a Micro-SDHC or Mini-SDHC slot.SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'SD CARDS' AND 'SDHC CARDS?SDHC is basically an upgrade to the older SD cards. The reason they upgraded it was to achieve greater data transfer speeds AND capacity than previously possible with normal SD cards... and to do this, they had to redesign the card (which is why it's not compatible with normal SD devices).  This was necessary because digital cameras and digital video cameras these days have higher resolutions, which equate to larger file sizes and faster data transfer needs.Now that many digital cameras also can record HD video, you may consider getting a larger capacity card because video takes much more space than photos. The size of the video varies from camera to camera depending on what resolution and video compression the camera uses. If you plan on taking lots of video (especially HD video), I would consider getting at least a 16GB card. Check your camera specifications to see how many minutes per Gig of memory your camera can capture ...to gauge how big of a memory card you'll want to get to meet your needs.Special Note on regular SD Cards:If you primarily take casual photos and don't need a exceptionally fast read/write capable card, you should know that newer cameras that take 'SDHC' cards will also work with older normal 'SD' cards. These older cards are cheaper than the new SDHC cards, so this may be something to consider. So to sum things up, newer cameras will take SDHC and regular SD cards, but older cameras that use SD cards may not be able to use SDHC cards. This is because newer technology is usually made to be compatible with older technology (the technical term used to describe this is 'backwards compatibility') ... but older technology may not have the hardware necessary to run newer tech (technical term used is 'obsolete'... just kidding! ;)I hope I haven't confused everybody by going into this much detail, but I can't help being the nerd that I am.  If you are confused, don't hesitate to comment on this post and I will try my best to answer your questions. Also, any feedback is always welcome!Conclusion: Buy the card if you have a new device that uses SDHC. It rocks!  (This message has been approved by the 'Duke of New Mexico')""

"20110426","4.0","Price vs Performance","Data can be written to the card at a Maximum rate of 5.6 MB/S.... That is my result after using my testing method which involves copying a known amount AVCHD data to the card whilst in my laptop's card reader....timing the transfer and then dividing data MB by time (SECS) and it is roughly the same figure as posted by the windows transfer data screen...(give or take). If the card is rated as a class six... then the Minimum write speed should be 6 MB/S. So we have a problem here...There is a reason for classifications like these...and that is to assure that consumers get a guaranteed level of performance.I understand the nature of the data, number of files and file size, card reader, computer used etc can affect results, so i can only give transcend a slight tap on the wrist for this anomaly. However, the card thus far is perfect for use in my point and shoot cybershot WX-5. And its price point can't be beat by the other brands. I use my point and shoot mainly for vlogging and i wanted no recording hiccups even if the camera records at a max of 17mbps or 2.125Mbps (1080p/ AVCHD) for which a class 4 would be enough...in theory. So my choice of a class 6 was to err on the side of caution with a bit of future proofing for eventual camcorder upgrades... Of course SLR's and the highest specs prosumer camcorders can test this present card's limit...but considering everything in the line of price vs performance..i think the card is worth it.""

"20080215","5.0","Works very well with my Sanyo HD1000 camcorder","Since I'm using this card with a camcorder, this review centers around how well it fares with regard to video-making.At 13Mpbs bitrate (MPEG-4 H.264/AVC), this card can hold 1 hour 24 minutes video. It's much more expensive than a MiniDV tape, but it transfers to a computer faster than real-time. According to SDHC Class 6 spec (6MBytes/s), that is approximately 3.6x. Using SanDisk MobileMate SD+ reader, I could get 20MBytes/s for reading, which is about 12x real-time.Unfortunately, since the camcorder uses FAT32 filesystem to store data on the memory card, it can only record up to 4GB per video, so continuous shooting can only run up to 42 minutes.Unlike MiniDV, memory cards like this one have no magnetic or mechanical problems, and it's pretty reliable. Since there is no mechanical parts, it's possible to operate camera in complete silence. The memory card's non-linear access capability also makes it easy to sort and browse through video footage.I have two of these cards: one of which I've used since November 2007, with the other one I bought a month later.

In fact I cant believe I am addressing this with all these reviews,  makes me question my own sanity.However I will add this since it is possible the other 3000 reviewers missed this important point, ~ Ha. ~  A class 6 card is faster than a class 2 or 4 card and not as fast as a class 10. My new  Nikon COOLPIX L120 camera would probably work just fine with a class 4 card but I chose the 6 to be on the safe side. A class 10 card would definitely be overkill and just a waste of money for a camera like mine.I bought the 4GB Card which will hold approximately 1500 photos or approximately 50 minutes of video on my camera.Also as I said in the title it works, how well for something like this , who knows.As long as it works and is a reasonable price :;;; BUY IT.'A Notable Note :::; The Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging works great also.NOW with the exception of ARTHUR my Amazon buddy reading this,  my review will probably disappear into that giant deep black hole of nearly 3000 reviews never to be seen by human eyes again.Update;  AAHHH: I was wrong again, 4 wonderful people besides Arthur read my review and gave me a positive vote, I would like to personally thank you all.""

"20080115","5.0","My Canon loves the 8 GB SDHC card","I recently purchased a Canon Powershot A720IS digital camera that is capable of recognizing and using up to 2 TERRABYTES of memory card (in the future) so I wanted to get the largest memory card I could install for now. I wanted to use the camera both on dry land and with an underwater housing for shooting stills and video on dive trips. Camera specs said an 8 GB SDHC card would record one hour of hi res video at 30 fps. Or nearly 2300 hi res stills at 8 megapixels.A test of the Transcend 8GB SDHC card in the camera ended up shooting 70 minutes of full screen, 30fps digital video that could not be distinguished from my DV camcorder video quality. Playback from the memory card to the TV was so fast & efficient there was never a single 'stutter' on the screen. The card speed is genuinely FAST as advertised.  Low level formatting of the card allowed for very acceptable rapid-fire sequential still photo shooting speeds when light levels were bright enough that the flash was not needed/used. Something like 2 photos every 3 seconds. Files were flawless in display, both for stills and video.This product was significantly lower in price than the Kingston 8GB SDHC card I originally bought with the camera. I've used both interchangeably and cannot see any different in the speed or capacity and quality of imagery is identical. For the money I'll stick with Transcend and am looking forward to getting their 16GB card once the price drops substantially below the $100 mark. That would provide nearly 2 1/2 hours of video on my still camera or 4600 highest quality stills. I'm afraid my camcorder will be collecting dust much of the time. A big advantage to video on the card is there are NO MOVING PARTS, e.g. a mini DV tape cassette and camcorder or VCR playback unit needed to dump the video and stills to my Mac for editing and burning DVDs. I just stick the card in the MicroMate USB card reader, plug it in the computer and bingo, ready to sort thru and dump to the hard drive. Since the card is formatted by a Canon camera it automatically boots up the Canon Viewer software too. That should work the same for other brands of still cameras formatting this chip.""

Since the card is formatted by a Canon camera it automatically boots up the Canon Viewer software too. That should work the same for other brands of still cameras formatting this chip.""

My only bad thought about this one is that a few days after I bought one from thememstore, they cut the price down two more dollars.Warning, though... if your device doesn't support SDHC cards, it won't detect this. I tried it with some SD card readers... even with our old digital camera. They didn't want to 'mate' with the card.""

It would be better when ordering a camera and a card from Amazon if I would get them both at the same time. What good is it to me to get the card 6 weeks prior to receipt of the camera. This is the problem with Amazon not stocking the card in their own warehouse and making me buy from a third party vendor. The probable good quality of this product is diluted by the hassle to get the item more conveniently. And, Amazon sends me an email weekly begging me to 'review' this product that I can't review because they haven't shipped my camera!

"20070726","1.0","I will never buy anoter Transcend product as long as I live","I'm like the rest of you that gave this card a 1 star rating. I bought the card because I needed more storage space.  I have an 8 gig version of this same card that has worked perfectly for a year. I recently bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC ZS7 because I wanted a more 'top of the line' level point and shoot.  I work at a school and frequently do video/picture shoots for school related events.  We had a Cinco De Mayo event, and the school was going to pay me $200.00 to film and take pics of the event. The Lumix and 16 gig card was PERFECT for this. One camera that could video and photograph with great quality. I filmed and took pics of the event with the camera, and there were no problems. When I got home, I plugged the card into my SDHC card reader, and the computer showed the little 'Removable disc L:' icon in the `My Computer' window. But when I double clicked on the icon to get to the pics and videos, a box popped up that said 'Please insert disc into drive L:'. I thought that was ODD, so I unplugged the card from the reader and replugged it in. The same error occurred. I then figured I'd just put the card back into the camera and read the data off the camera. Guess what? I got an error message on the camera that said 'Please insert SD card'. I have an old Canon Powershot A570 that I planned on selling. I put the card into it, and got an error saying 'Memory Card error'. I came on amazon, hoping someone else had the same problem and a solution to it. I saw a few posts that said if you set the card to the 'lock' position, the card suddenly becomes readable and you can retrieve your data off it. Others have said that they used data recovery software that was able to detect the card and get some/all their lost data back. I tried that with TWO data recovery softwares, and NEITHER of them was even able to detect the card when in the card reader.  All in all, I lost out on a $200.00 shoot because this card lost all my data on it's VERY FIRST USE, and is no longer even useable by my camera OR computer. I will never buy another Transcend product for as long as I live. All it takes is ONE error of this magnitude, and it is enough to make you stay away........for GOOD.""

I usually take two of these cards with me when I go on vacation and, although I take a ton of pictures, usually still come back with some room on the cards.

"20110330","4.0","Decent","For those looking for SD cards for a camera, you should know that the Class ratings are some combination of max/continuous, random/sequential, read/write speeds.  But the continuous sequential write speed is basically the only one that matters for use in a DSLR, and for this purpose, Sandisk does better than Transcend.  Also, there's no reason not to buy Class 10, which are not much more expensive (if at all) for cards up to about 8GB.I'm using this card in my Canon Rebel XS (the EOS 1000D), which doesn't have very high FPS, and doesn't do video.  If you have basically any higher-end DSLR, stick to Sandisk Class 10.  I haven't tested it, but I would guess that the 'burst' modes of even some high end compact cameras (which can hit 10 FPS for short bursts) might stress this card.""

"20110328","1.0","Total failure of memory card","I purchased a Transcend 8GB Class 6 SDHC card in February for use in my Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 camera. I wanted a memory card that was appropriate for still photos as well as a limited amount of video.  This card appeared to have very good reviews from a variety of sources.  I formatted the card in the camera and took several sample photos, all of which looked great.  I then took the camera and card to Africa on a safari trip.  Three days and 350 photos into the safari, the card failed completely.  While shooting a photo, the camera flashed a write error message and ceased to function.  I turned the camera off and then turned it on again.  This time, a message on the camera's LCD screen said to reinsert the card.  I turned the camera off, took the card out and reinserted it.  When I turned the camera back on, I got a message to insert the card, even though the card had already been reinserted.  I went through the entire off-on process again 3 more times but kept getting the same message to insert the card. I gave up and used a 2GB Panasonic SD card I took as a back-up and it worked fine for the rest of the trip.When I got home, I tried to view the data on my Transcend card in 4 different card readers and none of them recognized that the card had been inserted.  It was as if the card didn't exist.  After unsuccessfully trying to recover my pictures with the help of a Transcend U.S. technical support person (who was very accessible and willing to help), I finally sent the card to Transcend for possible data recovery by their technicians in Taiwan.  To Transcend's credit, they did not hesitate to offer to ship my card to Taiwan in an effort to recover my pictures, and they do not charge for their data recovery service.  However, they said it would take up to 3 months before I would get anything back from them and, of course, there was no guaranty that any of my pictures would be recoverable.I have no idea if the failure rate of Transcend cards is more or less than other brands but, be forewarned, these cards do fail. In fact, the exact same problem with the exact same SD card was experienced by another person on our safari.  Fortunately, when he got home he was able to recover about 70% of his pictures (but none of his video) using his computer and data recovery software.Needless to say, I am sick over the possible loss of photos that I will probably never be able to replicate. Lesson learned: if you are going on an extended trip, always take back-up memory cards and always take a portable drive or computer in order to frequently download photos/videos from your camera.""

I won't bother returning it, because I now do not trust this brand and don't want another clunker.  I'll go for ones I have had success with before - SanDisk or Kingston.  Good luck, but buyer beware. You get what you pay for.""

"20110224","5.0","Fast shipping and Affordable","I ordered with Amazon Frustration-Free shipping/packaging, and received my (16gb) memory card the VERY next day! The packaging really was without frustration; I just had to rip a paper strip and within seconds I was able to put the memory card directly to use.The huge space allows me to take over a thousand of the highest available quality of photos on my Canon PowerShot SD1400IS, which is more than enough for me! The pictures transfer with ease to my computer and other harddrives (using the memory card or the USB cable that came with the camera).Amazon has continued to amaze me with service, as well! The day I was due to have this sent to me, we had terrible snow here in Michigan. It was bad enough to even shut down my university, which rarely closes.

"20110222","5.0","Good one","Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6E  --- I would first like to say that this card does an amazing job at such an affordable price...  And Transcend is one of the best producer of memory cards....  I am like kind of buying a lot of flash memory cards and use it vigorously. This is compatible with my camera and I am very happy about it because some of the flash memory cards which I had bought earlier were not compatible with my old version cameras. That was disappointing.  Now coming to the card , the capacity is large. The speed of the flash memory card is very very fast.  You should be cautious when buying memory cards and it all depends on your camera version and style. Many of my friends have bought memory cards and they are not able to use them with their cameras due to the compatibility. So got to pick the right one for you.  The capacity is also good for video coverage. Sometimes I go in for a long shoot and this helps me a lot.  I was really satisfied with this product.""

So, it can happen.I've been using this Transcend 16gb card for nine months of heavy use with a Nikon-D5000 with no problems. I purchased another since the price has come down and also a class 10 32gb which is lightning fast. I also purchased cards for my daughters since they had new cameras which would handle the new HC cards but still using the slower cards. They were amazed at the difference.Price wise I cant see paying more for the name, for the sake of the name. Just over the past 6 months the price has come down on these cards and I would suggest to anyone to get you a 16gb card. Even my wife has a hard time filling it up. If only I could find a battery that could outlast her!This card is a great value & you cant go wrong making your purchase on Amazon. I always come here first for product information & reviews!""
"20101229","5.0","Great SD card for little price!","This SDHC card is good quality for a great price. I got the 8 GB card and it could take over 1200 14 megapixel photos and over 1 hour of HD quality video. STRONGLY recomend.""
"20101229","5.0","I am NOT going to pay a lot for a low capacity, low speed SDHC card","Quick Overview:Capacity - 4GBType - SDHCSpeed - 6 MByte/s (or 48 Mbit/s which would translate to a 40x rating).The speed rating and its small capacity and its low price make this an ideal choice for picture frames and some of the less expensive cameras and camcorders. We bought this one for our girl $50 camcorder and it works well with it. It gets a full 5 stars because it perfectly addresses our needs while being inexpensive.Notes of Caution:- This is an SDHC (with the HC underlined) card. Which means that some older devices may not support it even if it fits into the slot. You are safe if your gadget specifically specifies support for SDHC (as opposed to SD only). If not, it could still work but it's a gamble.- Make sure that this is the correct size before you order. SDHC cards also come in 'mini' and 'micro' sizes. While the 'micro' cards are easy to recognize because they are VERY small, the 'regular' (24 mm wide) and the 'mini' (20 mm wide) can be easily confused.- In addition, some old cameras may not recognize memory above 2GB and will format the card to use 2GB only.""

"20101222","4.0","FYI to all & especially to those 1 star reviewers","I have five of the 16 GB version of this card. I've had numerous other brands with mostly the same experiences from all of them.The first of these cards did give me a problem of not being recognized by my computer after 40-50 uses (of a dozen to several hundred shots each time).The really great thing about nearly all of the removable flash media is that you can get excellent repair/recovery (& testing) software from at least two major manufacturers of the cards (Sandisk & Lexar).  I have both & they were either free (with the purchase of one of the higher priced 'pro' cards) or at around $29.99 otherwise.  Both are excellent.  I do prefer the Lexar's Image Rescue 3 (version 4 may be available now)  You can recover 90% - 100% of your pictures if the card is not physically damaged too badly.  Most cards that 'go bad' are not physically damaged but have just lost the Index or it got corrupted on the card.These programs are very easy to run & I have recovered nearly all pictures from dozens of cards for friends & family.  Just wish that there was software this cheap & easy for computer disk drives as it's very very expensive to have them go through a recovery process!Notes:the amount time to recover photos will depend on the no. of GB on your card.also it will recover any & all photos that it finds - so if you used the card to full capacity back a couple of years ago on vacation then many of those photos will be found & recovered.  This if you have only been doing small numbers of photos at a time since. Then older pictures further down on the card have not been overwritten.By doing a 'Format' of the card each time you put it back in your device (Camera, Camcorder .....) It resets the index to like new again & all the pointers to your pictures are gone.  Deleting either individual pictures or a delete all only serves to remove pointers to the photos & does not reset/renew the index!  I always re-format in the device that it will be used in!In any of the cases of card not reading (whether or not you can get going again by 'formatting' the card) or you just accidentally deleted (or deleted all) or formatted the card - as long as you do not take pictures on the card then most of your previous pictures are still on there & may be recovered!Physically damaged cards many times can not be recovered but I have had pretty good luck getting several of them to read long enough to recover many pictures.almost forgot - the Lexar software can do a nice fix of a card that is not physically damaged by using the 'tools' options.  Be sure to use this type software on brand new cards to look for card errors. The extensive testing that the software can do from the same 'tools' options really helps you know about the long term reliability of the new card.  Cards with initial errors right out of the box need to be sent back as this is an indication of future problems!Hope this helps some of you.""
"20101222","1.0","The flash card works fine, they just send me half of it...","The flash card is working fine so far, but the reason I'm giving it a one star review is because I order and paid for a 16GB flash card, and Amazon send me a 8GB one.

"20101216","1.0","Unrecoverable Data","The card worked wonderfully for about 60-70 uses (a few hundred photos/videos)  over the span of about 4 months, the card was doing its job and I was happy with it. Then unfortunately when we were on vacation with a full days worth of photos, videos and memories collected the card died ( the card was still in the camera and the camera was never opened). After trying everything that could be done in software I contacted Transcend and they offered to try and salvage the data by physically opening the card but whatever happened to the card made any data unrecoverable.Luckily I always download photos off the card when returning back to the hotel so the data lost was cut to just that one day. Makes me sort of wish cameras had 2 card slots, one of which could be used for data redundancy. In the 10+  years i've been using digital cameras this has happened twice now. That actually seems like a very low failure rate to me but when you only have one opportunity to get a shot any failure is a big deal. Canon / Nikon are you listening?  Make that happen please : )""
"20101216","5.0","Great Deal! Amazing Product and Price!","This is the PERFECT time to buy this product an 8 GB SDHC [Secure Digital High Capacity] card comes in handy almost everywhere! It used to be you would get caught up in how large the storage was [aka 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, et cetera], but now the 'big thing' is all about the speed. With files, programs, etc. getting larger people are now looking towards 'How fast can this card transfer information?' That is what the 'Class' rating is for. 'Class 10' has become one of the new fads among technical people now, but before that Class 6 was the highest you could find. Class 6 is a superfast great speed for the normal user! Take advantage of this price drop while you can! By the way Class 6 means a read and write to the card of 6 MB/s and a Class 10 can do 10 MB/s 'in theory' because it does not always work that way. So unless you are doing some crazy insane intense data transferring for a project, work, etc. stick with this 8 GB Class 6! You just will not notice a difference between Class 6 and Class 10 for normal/realistic usage. [And yes there are cards that are way faster near 100 MB/s, but those you 1). Can't find anywhere and 2). Would be expensive as heck!]FINAL NOTE: BUY at this amazing Price! It just cannot be beat!

I had previously been using Class 4 SD cards, and ran into occasional problems where the card could not save the data quickly enough and the camera would stop recording video. Since upgrading to these Class 6 cards, I have not had this issue at all. In fact, my buffer meter (which only pops up when the SD card is struggling to save data quickly enough) no longer pops up at all on my screen while shooting video, and delay time between stopping the recording and the camera finalizing the file is much shorter. As far as value, these 8 GB class 6 SD cards were the same price as the class 4 cards of the same size I was using before. This is a much better option for anyone needing the better speed of a class 6 card. The value is excellent!""

It seemed like a great deal: 16GB, Class 6, and a Transcend CompactFlash card I had before had been pretty reliable. When it comes to photos, it performs well at burst rates. However, for HD video, this card is very unreliable. It overheats and will stop recording after even 2 seconds at its worst. Seems like 1080p 24fps is especially hard for this card to deal with. So, if you're going to shoot video, I highly recommend that you avoid this card. For HD video, it sounds like Sandisk Extreme cards, Class 6 and up, are best.""

"20101111","2.0","Barely qualifies as class 6","I purchased this card because I take a number of speed shots and, while my camera can hold them in memory for a period of time until they are written to disk, I periodically fill that memory as well.  As a result I wanted to get a fast card compatible with my camera. The specs for class 4 memory cards go up to 15MB per second, while the ones for 6 cards go up to 20MBps. The packaging claims 16MBps meaning that this only barely gets into the class 6 range.  This would be more than adequate for most things, but when I am taking pictures of my daughter's rugby team in sport mode, I want them to be written to the card as fast as possible, I know that the card speed is just one of a number of things that go into the actual write speed, but this is the one that I can easily change.

I had not shipped the memory chip with the camera as instructed by Nikon.  Eventually while talking with Nikon via phone I swapped the memory chip from my camera to a friends exact same camera and the reverse (this person's chip to my camera).  With the other chip in my camera I did not have any problems.  My chip in their camera, the camera experienced the exact same problems I experienced when that chip was in my camera.  So I contacted Transcend and they did immediately replaced the memory chip.

Oh well, this review is not about the Pandora it is about these cards.  Anyway, I got one of those media boxes that plug into your HDTV and allow you to watch netflix but also video you've ripped/downloaded.  Since getting the box, it has been at least 6 months now, I completely fill and erase these cards weekly.  I rip most everything to 720p(the max rez of my TV) so they fill quite fast.A lot of reviews say there is a read/write limit, and logically there is, but it isn't a low number like 20, it has to be much higher than that.  The type of memory these are made of have read/write capability in the thousands and I'm sure you'll get a few 100 of them before the card craps out.  Maybe in cameras it is different, but I'm doing complete fills, like at least 14 GB of the space, and erasing it all to fill it back up.  I do this for each card about once a week.  I know it is much more than 20 times.I once had a friend that was distraught that he lost pictures on a USB Flashdrive, his computer(windows) wouldn't read, write, or format it.  I stuck it in my Linux PC and it worked great, pulled the pictures off and re-formatted it for him.  After that it worked great on his PC.  If you have problems with your card and your camera and/or PC has trouble with it find a mac person or install Linux, some times it helps to use another OS to get cards working again, I think this might be some of the problems people are having.""

"20101027","1.0","Epic Piece of Trash, Avoid at all Costs","Where to begin:I bought two of these cards last summer to use with my Canon VIXIA HF200 camcorder. They worked GREAT... until they failed for no reason whatsoever. The first card failed within the first six months after purchase. The video in the card wasn't particularly important, but I was disappointed nonetheless. Transcend claims to have a 'Lifetime Warranty' on their products, so I completed an RMA and sent off the card. I received a new one a couple of weeks later. In September of this year, I went to see some relatives overseas with my wife. We made interviews with my grandparents both of whom are closed to the end of their lives. I was capturing these memories for posterity, but then guess what happened: card number 2 failed. To say I was irate would be the understatement of the year. I waited until I returned state side and tried several software options for data recovery (none of which worked) and finally found a place in Connecticut (A+ Perfect Computers, [...]/flash-drive/transcend) that specialized in Transcend cards and their site explained why they are so prone to failure (I guess they know what pieces of crap they are). I sent off my card to them. Two weeks and $375 dollars later, I received all my data in a 16GB flash drive, along with the damaged card, which they had to open in order to retrieve the data. Anyhow, I filled out an RMA for a new card with Transcend, additionally, I explained that the card had been sent to CT for data recovery, hence the case opening.Today, I receive a package from Transcend which included my BROKE card along with a letter explaining that they do not cover 'physically damaged' products. I call their long distance 'customer service' line to ask why my RMA had been denied. The girl answered that the product had been damaged. I explained, in great detail the problems I'd had with their products and that my attempt at recovering the data from THEIR defective product WAS THE CAUSE of the damage. She then had the gall to say to me 'we offer data recovery, did you ask for it?' I about flipped, I said 'I want you to show me where, in your RMA process, is this offered as an option' that was met with silence. I then asked 'Does anyone EVER send you a blank memory card for an RMA? How could they if the cards fail DURING use!' Again silence. Then I asked her to show me how they inform the customer, during the RMA process of their data recovery service. All she kept repeating was 'the customer has to request data recovery.' After that I told her I was very disappointed and would not be purchasing ANY Transcend cards or any of their crappy products and hung up.I realize these cards are cheap, but you know, the data that goes in them can be invaluable. If they are going to claim a lifetime warranty, then honor the warranty. More importantly, if you know your product is crap, then at least OFFER THE DATA RECOVERY SERVICE IN THE RMA process. I paid a lot of money to get data retrieved from these crappy card and for them to welch on a card that probably costs $5 dollars is just outrageous.Transcend memory cards are crap. Once, hmm, maybe okay benefit of the doubt... two within 20 months, YOU HAVE A DESIGN FLAW.STAY AWAY FROM THESE HORRIBLY MANUFACTURED CARDS, THEY WILL COST YOU IN THE LONG RUN.I've learned my lesson, I will pay a little more for the Sandisk cards in the future./rant""

"20101026","5.0","Plenty of memory, plenty fast","I bought this for a Nikon P100 which I returned in favor of a Canon sx30is. It worked fine in both. I took over 200 pictures at a time on the Nikon, set at a moderate photo size; I also shot a few short videos. I shot bursts of 20-30 shots continuously with no problem. The videos continued to roll without hicup. The camera never recorded fewer than 9,999 picture capacity remaining. I transfered pictures to my computer by removing the chip from the camera and inserting it into my computer (or, the first time, into a Kingston usb card reader). Transfer was far faster than when I have connected a Canon Rebel to the computer via usb (and, of course, transfer does not drain the camera battery this way).I have just started using this chip in the Canon sx30is, but it formatted quickly and works fine so far.Incidently, I searched Amazon in vain for some information on the difference between class 1 and class 6. It turns out that class 6 is faster and therefore does not interrupt the flow of shooting video. I see that class 10 is available but I have not used it and cannot comment on whether it is worth the considerable price spread. This one transfers my pictures so fast that it is hard to imagine how a faster card would improve my life!""

Ours failed less than a year after we got it (about 10 months, actually) taking a day's worth of photos with it. Up until then, write speed was good, and I considered it a good card.

"20101007","1.0","Absolutely horrible!","I bought a 16GB Transcend SDHC Class 6 card for my Olympus SP-800UZ. It worked fine when I tested it before my trip to Washington DC. I formatted the card in my camera and also took pictures to make sure the card is good. Throughout my 2 day trip, everything was fine. I took about 300 photos. But when I returned and put the card in my PC's card reader, it made my computer sluggish and from then on, I could not access the card and the PC only recognized it as a 512KB card. Contacted Transcend. They replied with a standard answer and a freeware for recovering files. Did not work. I emailed back and I didn't hear from them again. Now, I'm trying to format it, but even then, I can't detect the card anymore.This is the worst experience I have with a flash card. Will definitely skip Transcend and stick to my other trusted brands in future.""

I have never had a problem with running out of space or needing to switch to the backup card, except if I was in a prime photo op and couldn't leave the camera off long enough to download the photos! This would hold all the photos I could probably shoot in a weeks time.I have had strange messages from my antivirus program that indicate infected temp files while downloading my photos. I have also had some RAW files come up as not retrievable. I will have to see if this persists and try the second card to see if it resolves the problem.""

Transcend memory on Amazon was the cheapest per gb (at given class 6 speed) I found, which is about all you can compare among different sd cards.  Haven't had any problems with Transcend cards since I've started buying them about 6 months ago.""
"20100930","3.0","Slower than most Class 6 cards but cheap","I have a variety of Class 6 Transcend cards as well as a dozen or so from other companies. It's interesting the actual speeds of Transcend's Class-6 cards vary widely. For example, I have two identical 8 GB Class 6 cards that were purchased about 6 months apart. The older one benchmarks (using ATTO-DISK the same software used in some professional reviews) about 50% faster than the newer one.This 16 GB card is slower than both of my Transcend 8 GB cards. In fact it's the slowest Class 6 card I have period. Most Class 6 cards test in the 10MB/sec - 15MB/sec range. This card only manages around 9MB/sec. The spec calls for a minimum of 6MB/sec so it still is acceptable. If you're interested, check my review of the SanDisk Extreme Class 6. It's literally more than 3 times faster than this card (but also costs significantly more).It's also worth noting the SanDisk Ultra Class 4 cards far outperform this card. But SanDisk is sort of in a class by themselves.The good news is if you're just shooting JPG still pics, or anything less than full 1080HD video, this card is probably fast enough. Only shooting HD Video at the highest quality settings on a higher end camera, or shooting long bursts of RAW images on a DSLR, are likely to tax this card.I've also had a Transcend 2 GB card fail and I lost everything on it. While any card can fail, I've not had any problems with SanDisk or Kingston despite using those brands more heavily. There are lots of other reports of people having problems with Transcend cards as well (although some of those are likely from trying to use a card that was too slow for their application). So you have to balance the lower price with the possiblity you might lose everything on the card and the slower performance.Finally, beware everything you put this card in needs to be SDHC compatible. If your PC, device or reader is more than a few years old, it might not be. I know people who filled up their new SDHC card with irreplaceable pics and video, plugged it into their older PC to download the pics, and corrupted the card because the PC wasn't SDHC compatible. They lost everything. If you have any doubt, stay with 2 GB standard SD cards, or test everything before you risk losing anything important.""
"20100930","4.0","As good as the brand names","This card worked great in my Nikon D5000 for basic photography. I didn't test burst modes or anything fancy, but the card worked without a hitch. I still think the 16gb Class 6 cards are all over-priced, but this Transcend card was the least offensive on the price scale. You get what you pay for, which is to say the exact same as the competition.""
"20100930","5.0","Good Value","I'll begin by saying that I've always purchased Sandisk memory cards for all of my digital cameras and was very hesitant to purchase this card.  My daughter told me that she had several Transcend cards and had experienced no problems with them.  The reviews here still worried me some but I decided to give them a try - knowing I had a small sandisk that I could use as backup (even if it meant having to dump the card to my laptop several times.)  I'm happy to report that I used these cards this weekend while shooting a wedding (I did some test shots first) and experienced no problems.  There was no lag time even when shooting several shots in quick succession and my images look great.  I was also impressed with the packaging - each card was in a snap-lock plastic case and sealed in a small bubble wrap envelope.""

After a while, the card would just stop working.  My camera would display a message like memory card error.  Sometimes, turning the camera off and on would fix the problem, sometimes not.  The only way to fix the error was to completely re-format the card.  That means erasing all your photos currently on the card, which I don't like to do.  The same thing happened with the other card.

I reformatted the card with the camera and got 47 pics with the same reult (card full/ lots of corrupt pics)3rd time i got 152 pics with about 25% corruption. 4th time 52 pics and same results. I then reformated with the PC, same thing, reformat with pc and the camera, same results. I was leaving for a 3 week grand canyon rafting trip 2 days later so I had to go buy another SC card. I bought a different brand (Delkin) of course and it works perfectly.On return from the trip I called Beach Camera but since I didnt have to original packaging they wouldnt replace it. Who ever keeps the little cardboard sleeve the cards come in after you have to rip it in half to get the card out. I guess thats one way to get around warranty issues. They told me to call Transcend and they would replace it since it has a 1 year warranty. SO, I called Transcend and was told ,'No problem just fill out the online form and mail it back and in a few weeks well send you another card.' PROBLEM, The online form requires you to put in the product # found on the cardboard sleeve or you cant even finish filling out the form. Its not anywhere on the card itself. SO, I had to call Transcend again and get the product # to finish the form. The Cusomer service rep did tell me the card has a lifetime warranty vs electrical problems (not 1 year like Beach Camera told me).

Instead look at a Sandisk Extreme III.  The 8GB version cost as much as the Transcend 16GB.  There is a reason for that. SPEED.  Other than being very slow, there have been no issues and card works perfectly.  This would make a good card for video capturing, but for photography, you are going to miss a lot of shots using this card.  Expect a several second delay between photos because it takes so long to write you last image to the card's memory.  See my review for the Sandisk Extreme III card for a further explanation of why speed is important.""

This must be a throwback from the 1990s ('80's?)! I complained to the company where I bought it and was told that the Windows 7 Starter was part of the problem, the other problem being lack of memory.  They said if I bought Windows 7 Home Premium and a large SD, the card would act as virtual RAM and it would speed right up.I received both products quickly and packaged well from Amazon, but I'm still wondering what Win7 upgrade is good for, and the Transcend 8 GB card absolutely refuses to work with my computer for anything other than storage.  If all it's good for is storage I'd rather use it in my camera, so that's where it is.  It does work fine there.  I'm back to a 4GB SD card for the netbook, which doesn't seem to speed it up at all.

I have an old olympus that I planned on sellinggiving to my sister. I put the card into it, and got an error saying some kind of error.. I came on amazon, hoping someone else had the same problem and a solution to it. I saw a few posts that said if you set the card to the 'lock' position, the card suddenly becomes readable and you can retrieve your data off it. Others have said that they used data recovery software that was able to detect the card and get some/all their lost data back. I tried that with TWO data recovery softwares, and not either  of them was even able to detect the card when in the card reader. All in all, I lost out on a couple of hundered bucks because this card lost all my data on it's first time using it, and is no longer even useable by my camera OR computer. I will never buy another I'm like the rest of you that gave this card a 1 star rating. I bought the card because I needed more storage space. I have an 8 gig version of this same card that has worked perfectly for a year. a different one because I wanted a more 'top of the line' level point and shoot. I work at a school and frequently do video/picture shoots for school related events. We had a rugby event, and I was going to get reimbursed for  photographing and take pics of the event. The Lumix and 16 gig card was just right for this. One camera that could video and photograph with great quality. I filmed and took pics of the event with the camera, and there were no problems.

I replaced the card with a different brand, and the errors went away, so the problem is definitely the card, not the camera (which, btw, is a great camera).

It was only being used in my netbook as additional storage - and so was not subjected to the wear and tear of removal and insertion. Nor does my netbook have heavy use (being only used on vacation) It went in, and remained there until failure - which only amounted to about 5 weeks of actual use.During that time period I had bought another of these Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC cards to use in a camera. As I use a card reader to transfer images to the computer this SD card was removed and reinserted several times a month. It failed after about 8 months.In January of this year I had bought another of these, and it failed last month - 5 months of light use in a different digital SLR.I have Kingston and SanDisk 16 GB cards, none of which have failed.Additionally, I have over a dozen Transcend 2-8 GB SDHC cards, none of which have failed either.I can only conclude that either I have experienced a highly improbable event with this 100% failure rate, or that there is a flaw in the Transcend 16 GB cards.This latter seems much more likely, and I will avoid Transcend cards of more than 8 GB capacity.Today I just bought a SanDisk 32 GB SDHC - though more expensive than the Transcend 32 GB, I have the expectation that it is not as likely to fail.Caveat emptor: Let the buyer beware.""

At the end April this year Digital SLR Cameras were becoming quite affordable and versatile.  I purchased a Canon T2i and two more of the Transcend 16gb Class 6 cards.  I was on my way to the Middle East to record a graduation and would eventually visit London.Using the Canon T2i indoors was fine, it would of course overheat if used constantly for over 40 minutes.  I shot outside one day and let the camera rest every once and awhile.  It was hot out.  When I finally finished shooting my camera turned off by itself.  I learned the memory card had fried.I returned back to the states and brought it to professional specialists who were unable to read the card, even through using a linux machine.  I continued using my remaining cards to shoot, but began seeing overheating warnings after 30 minutes of shooting, mostly indoors.Today I was testing out my cards and one of them would report an error after recording 2 minutes on my Sony PMW-EX1.

Transcend (the maker / distributor) was rated in the high middle of reliability and pricing.

"20100702","5.0","Great alternative to the SanDisk and very affordable.","I didn't know much about the brand and was very reluctant to buy, but for the price and size of the card you really can't go wrong.  I've always had good experience with SanDisk but couldn't justify paying double for the same type of card.  I can't say that the Transcend is any better or worse than the equivalent SanDisk, but as far as taking pictures and video I have no complaints.  The videos look sharp and clean with no lag.  Pictures load fast and look great. I definitely would consider Transcend more in the future.""
"20100701","4.0","What you pay is what you get...","I recently purchased Canon T1i DSLR along with SanDisk 4GB Extreme III - SDHC Class 6 High Performance memory card (SDSDX3-004G-P31, Retail Packaging) - NEW 30MB/s version. Looking back, I think I should have ordered higher capacity card. I prefer shooting in RAW mode, which requires more storage than Jpeg images. Each RAW image is about 20MB. A 4 GB card holds about 250-300 images. On a outdoor trip, usually I end up shooting 400-500 images, causes me to replace card in the middle of shoot. To avoid running in 'Card full' errors, I wanted to buy higher capacity card this time.Transcend 16GB card seemed really good choice for second card. 16 GB class 6 performance and attractive price tag, I was very interested in buying it. There was $10 difference between SanDisk 4GB and Transcend 16GB card. Both of them were class 6 cards and I thought it should be ok. Amazon reviews were good for both of the cards.Finally I received the Transcend card today and first thing I noticed, speed! SanDisk is way faster than Transcend!I did setup a simple test to measure the speed of both cards.Canon 500 D (T1i) + Canon 50mm 1.8 lens in Manual Focus mode + 1/50 sec exposure + Continuous shooting mode + f1.8I took 15 photos with each card. Manual focus was used to avoid any focusing delays. I was just interested in knowing the speed of card operation. Results were as following:SanDisk - 15 photos - Camera started taking pause after 9 shots - Total time required to finish writing 15 images was 20 seconds.Transcend - 15 photos - Camera started taking pause after 8 shots - Total time required to finish writing 15 images was 39 seconds.The speed of SanDisk was almost double compared to Transcend.If you are tight on budget and capacity is main concern then you should buy Transcend. If you are looking for fast memory cards, then look something else.Hope this helps.""

"20100615","1.0","Lost Photos; No Help from Transcend Technical Support","I have two Transcend 8gb SDHC cards and two 16gb SDHC cards.  About three weeks ago, I had one of the 16gb SDHC cards fail on me.  The card was bought new from Amazon and inserted and tested before use. It worked flawlessly, recording photos and I was able to download them successfully.  I filled one of the 16gb cards while on vacation and started on the second.  It worked fine the first day.  The second day, I hiked 1.5 miles through a canyon and climbed about 300 feet.  I then took about 40 photos when the card failed.  My camera, a Canon XSi, flashed a message 'card not formatted.'  I inserted a backup card and continued shooting.  But I have never been able to recover the lost files.  I have tried four different card recovery programs.  Only one of these was able to identify the Canon CR2 files, but could not recover the files in a form that any software program (e.g., iphoto and photoshop) could open.  Two programs were unable to find any data at all on the card.  The most frustrating part of this experience has been the attitude ('get lost and don't bother us') of the Transcend technical support people in Los Angeles.  I emailed them three times over two weeks without a reply.  I then called, and finally was advised how to download their own card recovery program.  I ran this program and it found Nikon NEF files on the card.  Strange!  I don't even own a Nikon camera and only used the card for two days with my Canon camera.  The putative 'NEF' files were unreadable.  Upon informing Transcend support of the failure of their software, I was told mechanically to use it again.  Endless emails and voicemail messages were not returned.  I can only conclude that this is a common problem with Transcend cards, and the company has no solution, and therefore sees no point in wasting time with customers.  So, purchase at your own risk.  I have had a 25 percent failure rate, and learned that just because a Transcend card performs initially, it can still fail at any time and your photos and/or data will be lost forever.""

This card has withstood multiple insertions in and out of the camera and the computer, and it has held up well-- that means it's durable.The class 6 is substantially faster than the regular SD card I was using at first, and I needed at least this type of speed to be able to shoot video or burst mode with my DSLR.  It has been plenty of speed for me, but I haven't used anything faster.

I got this Transcend SDHC card for a Fuji HS10 camera and took several hundred photos with it.  I really wanted to test it.  It worked fine.  For a while.Then, at a conference, after I had taken about 300 photos with it, mostly of slide presentations, a major glitch happened.  I had accidentally hit the record video button on the camera, and so I moved to delete this unwanted video.  Now, I had done this 'delete' function a number of times on the HS10 camera, and never had a problem.  There is no way on the HS10 to accidentally delete ALL of your photos all at once with this delete button (you can do that only if you go through the main menu and activate the 'format' function).As soon as this video got deleted, this card decided that the rest of the stored photos, some 300 of them, also no longer existed.Bummer.  Fortunately the great Amazon 30-day warranty was still in effect, and I had saved the packaging.  I ordered a Sandisk SDHC 30Mb/sec card (which does not run much faster on the HS10, by the way).  Yesterday, the Sandisk card arrived, and so I sent this Transcend card back to Amazon today for a refund.If you look at all the Amazon reviews, about 20% of the reviews (one star to three star) make some comment about the unreliability of this Transcend card.  Can you believe that Amazon actually sells this thing?  Just think, what  if 20% of one brand of new cars sold in this country stopped running days to months after the purchase?

"20100430","5.0","I don't have to think about it","A flash memory card should just work, and always work.  That's what this has done for me over the last year and a half.  I chose this size because it could be easily backed up to one blank DVD, and two 4GB cards gives me redundancy over 1 8GB card.  I use it in a Canon SLR, and sometimes in a portable card reader or a built-in reader on a computer.  I have had no issues of any kind.  Money well spent.""
"20100429","2.0","If you buy, be sure to format!","I bought two of these for my Canon Rebel XS right before going on a trip. Just a couple of days into the trip when I tried to take a picture, the camera said there was an error, it couldn't read the memory card and my pictures weren't on it anymore. I called the Canon support number and after answering some basic questions they asked if I had formatted the card, which I did, when I first put the card in the camera. But it turns out you should format it every time you upload pictures to your computer or any time you remove the card. I don't know if it's common knowledge, but I didn't know that, and my camera manual certainly didn't state that. Apparently sometimes just deleting the photos from the card doesn't take all the data off, and it can cause the cheaper cards to malfunction.The tech support guy then asked what brand my card was. When I told him Transcend, he said the higher end cards like Scandisc are less sensitive. That same day I bought a Scandisc card, and I haven't had any trouble with it. It cost me $10 more for one 4GB Scandisc than for these two 4GB memory cards, but if I have less chances to have another malfunction, I'll pay for it. I just wish I hadn't bought those other two first. Transcend are probably okay cards, but if you don't want to risk your photos, I'd spring for the Scandisc. The moral of this review is really don't forget to format your memory cards.""

"20100409","5.0","Awesome SDHC card for Readyboost.","I purchased this card (Transcend SDHC 4GB) to use in my new Dell Mini netbook specifically for Readyboost.The Readyboost feature in Windows 7 actually works unlike Vista. If you are unaware of the Readyboost feature, it basically enables your PC to use a memory card 'like' RAM. It actually takes advantage of Windows Superfetch technology.A high speed card is neccessary to use the Readyboost feature. This card is working perfectly for this purpose.When you plug the card into your reader, Windows 7 will prompt you if you are wishing to use this for Readyboost or other purposes.If you select the Readyboost option, Windows will tell you this card is not qualified for Readyboost.This is because this card does not come formatted in the required NFTS format. Just right-click on the card under 'My Computer', then left-click 'format', select the NFTS format and your good to go. BTW, make sure the 'Quick Format' box is checked.After formatting is complete right click the card under 'My Computer' again and select properties. In the new window that pops up.You will see a tab marked 'Readyboost', click on it. From there, tou will have the option to allocate some of the free space on the card or there's even a box where you can dedicate the card for Readyboost.""

I have been using the 'Transcend' line of memory cards for years in all of my Canon cameras, and have yet to have a single problem with any of them, regardless of the type (Class 6, etc.) With that in mind, I have no problem in highly recommending this card and manufacturer to anyone in need of what I consider a high-quality, Camera-ready Class C memory card.Skip, Citrus Springs, Florida""

"20100226","5.0","Works Like a Charm.","I recently purchased a Canon Rebel T1i and wanted a fast card to keep up with action shots. When I first got the camera I purchased some cards from Walmart that were a class 4, when using the continuous shooting mode the class 4 could only handle about 5-6 shots before my camera had to wait for the card to catch up. Today I put in this Class 6 Transcend card and it shot non stop for over 30 pics (I didn't want to keep going). I have never used the more expensive brands so I am not sure how this compares to those but for the needs I have and the price I paid this can not be beat. Shipping only took a few days too.

"20100222","5.0","Lots of reliable memory for moderate price.","The 3 things you need to check to be sure this will fit your device are 1) the physical size, 2) storage size, 3) class/speed.Size: there are regular sized chips and 'micro' sized chips. This is a regular size, NOT a micro, so if you need a micro size, pass on this. This is about the size of a stamp and the thickness of a quarter, physically, with what looks like a corner cut off.Storage size: The 8 Gig size is the most my device will handle, so check your device. Smaller will work, but more will be wasted. This gave me over 24 hours of recording time at a high quality recording speed.Class: The flash chip here is a class 6 (which means it functions at a higher speed [not sure if it's double, just that it's faster overall] than a class 4, which in turn is faster than a class 2).The 'HC' means high capacity, as opposed to earlier models which should be labelled just 'SD' without the HC.I have just reached its full capacity and will be getting another one.

I've been using the card for a few months now and have never experienced any issues with it. I find it so reliable that I just ordered and received my second card.My bottom line is if you need a fast SDHC card for recording high def video and want to spend as little as possible, definitely consider giving this product a try.

"20100104","2.0","VERY slow, perhaps not really Class 6???","When I bought my Canon T1i, upgrading from a Digital Rebel XT, I bought a SanDisk Extreme III Class 6 16GB SDHC card.  I can shot about 54 rapid fire 'sports' shots ('large' jpg only, no RAW) before the camera slows down using the SanDisk.  Using this Transcend I can do about 28 before the camera slows down.  This is mounted on a tripod pointed at a light so it's very bright with the shutter relaese held down.  Either the SanDisk Extreme III is much faster than Class 6 -OR- the Transcend is much slower, either way, if you're shooting lots of rapid fire images as I do or HD video skip the Transcend as it doesn't hold up to advertisement.Also, before anyone says 'well, the Sandisk is 2x the price', they're right but you get what you pay for in this case and if you need speed, this is NOT the device for you.  If, on the other hand, all you're doing is shooting the occassional photo, it'll probably be just fine as they have a good reputuation for reliablity.  Too bad performance doesn't match.  I was prepared to buy several more.In the end I ordered SanDisk's new Extreme Class 10 card and paid $104 for it, but when speed counts, $ is secondary.""

I hope to get a reliable card in Kingston, whose RAM memory chips I've used in the past with great success.Amazon has been great in refunding my purchase and even allowing me to keep the failed card in hopes of one day hiring expensive data recovery services to recover my lost wedding videos, (though avoiding the unpleasant process would have ultimately been better).The following is a thank you email that has been returned to me.  I am posting it here as I have no other way to send it to the proper Amazon representative recipient.'Dear Prashanth D.,Thank you so much for addressing these issues and so quickly!

I also asked a ton of people, and they didn't know.I finally went to a camera class and asked the instructor at the break. He was surprised and thought it was my memory card. I needed a faster one.

"20091207","5.0","Great SDHC card for DSLR owners","I bought this card back in Oct to be the primary card for my Nikon D5000 DSLR camera.  I think the Class 6 16GB cards are priced right ($30-$40 on avg) and figured 16GB should be enough storage while I'm on vacation taking pictures/videos.  I wanted at least a Class 6 card to give me enough performance while shooting action shots.I browsed the internet for SDHC card benchmark tests and found one on Tom's Hardware where the Class 6 16GB Transcend card scored very well despite it not being a 'Turbo' card.  The Transcend Turbo card was tested by TH, but offered no advantages over this one.  Only the more expensive Lexar and SanDisk cards tested better in some cases.  This particular card's tested write throughput (key for SLR's) was over 15MB/sec, significantly more than the universal 6MB/sec standard of Class 6 cards.  Only 3 other cards could beat this card in write throughput and none of them are in this price range.  Tested read bandwidth was at the top of the pack going beyond 19MB/sec.  Overall this card was one of the best tested cards, hanging in there with Lexar and SanDisk without any special 'label', ie Extreme or Platinum.My experience backs up these tests from TH as shooting in RAW (10MB pix) or jpeg (6MB pix) is handled without any lag or slowdown.  You can truly experience the unbridled performance of a DSLR camera using this card, and do it on a budget.
