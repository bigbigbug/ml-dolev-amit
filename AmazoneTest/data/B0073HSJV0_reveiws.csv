"20120611","5.0","Awesome!","True story: Had my heart set on the Nikon D3100, but I couldn't bring myself to pay that much for it. Rewind to my son's 8th grade graduation about 2 weeks ago. I don't have a camera right now so I was using my cell phone which ran out of batteries by the time the graduation procession started. I was devastated. FORTUNATELY a good friend whose son was graduating from the same class was sitting right behind me and she had a gorgeous professional looking camera. She offered to take pics of our son for me. When she emailed them to me the next day, OMG her pictures looked like professional quality photos! The zoom, picture color and clarity was so unbelievable! I HAD to know what the name of her camera was so I could look it up. She said a Nikon Coolpix L810. I quickly looked it up online and I couldn't believe it was in the $200 price range! (Found it cheapest on Amazon though--I paid $199 for it)! I was shocked at the price! I thought for SURE this camera was going to be a $400+ camera because it looked so expensive! I ordered it on a Friday and got it on Monday! I'm in LOVE with this camera. I've been practicing taking photos with it outside my work during my breaks and the pictures are just beautiful, the zoom is AMAZING. Now, it's definitely not a quick point and shoot camera. You should ABSOLUTELY read the focus instructions VERY carefully before you use this otherwise your pictures come out blurry. BUT that's not a camera issue, it's a 'you not focusing the camera correctly' issue. Lol. So take your time practicing with the focus and getting to know all its shooting modes and features before you try to use it for special occasions like graduations, weddings...etc. After you get used to it, you will be in love with it. The price for the quality of this camera is outstanding. Love the size of it too. Big enough to be taken seriously, but small enough to fit in a purse or bag for travel. Not heavy, but just enough weight to it to give that quality feel. It's perfect!""

"20120609","5.0","Sweet camera!","This is a SWEET camera! It's not only gorgeous, but practical. Love the quality of the pictures, the ease of use, and the fact that it has regular AA batteries. You can get them anywhere. You can get a good grip in the camera. Also, came as a package with the camera case and memory card. I'm in love with it!""
"20120607","4.0","Good picts, wish there was manual override","So far, I have taken about 500 pictures with the original batteries.  Can't wait to see how long rechargeables actually last.  I reccomend that you play with the scene selections.  The 'obvious' choice may not be the best choice.  For example, I got the best results taking pictures of flowers with the food setting.  The sport setting is good for general picts.  The portrait setting is good if you want a softened look to your subject matter.  I have not had the best of luck with the landscape setting.  I was able to get some rather good picts of the full moon using a tripod and the night landscape setting.  Better moon picts from auto and color select black and white.  Was able to get picts of my son kicking a football, and it did 'stop' the ball mid air using the sports setting.  The burst mode in the sports setting is adequate.  I do reccommend using a class 10 memory card, though.  Write time even with a class six was annoyingly slow.I will say that my outdated Fuji S700 was more fun to use since I could utilize shutter priority and aperature priority.  I really enjoy the effects of tinkering with speed and depth in pictures.  Still, I cannot argue with the sharpness of the images the L810 offers.""
"20120604","5.0","Lights...Nikon... Action!","I Was in the market for a new/better camera and saw this one, noticed it was a Nikon and it was $215. Wanted it after seeing a Nikon just like this in Walmart for $500. Read reviews, no real negatives besides a defective camera once in a while, which happens with any product: tvs,computers,cameras, etc. Which doesnt mean the product itself is bad. I was jumbling around between this one and a couple others that were a little cheaper, but im so glad i chose this one! Its a beautiful, sleek lookin camera that takes GREAT quality photos and video.""
"20120531","5.0","Nikon L810","A great camera. Sort of midway between a point and shoot and a standard SLR but much much lighter in weight. I was able, while sitting at a ballgame, to get closeups of players in action. Even caught a ball in motion once. A tripod allowed me to shoot Venus clearly. I have another Coolpix and understand the focusing. This is light, easy to hold, the controls are so much easier than my older Coolpix, and the shots are just great. I've had a great time playing with it. It's not a simple point and shoot however, you have to know something about cameras or take the time to really learn how this one works.""
"20120529","5.0","love this camera","This is the best camera I have owned in the past 6 years.I bought it for the zoom,  it did not dissapointtook it to Scotland and London, did not have to worry about chargingit takes batteries, kept batteries in my purse and was always readypictures near and far are beautiful  video clear with good soundafter seeing my pictures  friends are out to buy it to!""
"20120526","5.0","Extremely pleased.","The camera is wonderful for the price. The zoom is amazing and works very well with still subjects in high light. It gets a little grainy with moving subjects in lower lights (ex. zoo)... I am very pleased with the camera and can't wait to take in on vacation!""
"20120523","4.0","Its good!!","I do like this camera, I just recieved it today!! Only and ONLY thing I would change is that the camera does NOT come with a lens cover?!?!?!?! I guess I thoguht this was standard on all cameras, guess I should've read more in depth...Just have to be super careful with it!!""
"20120523","3.0","Thinking of Returning :-(","I was so excited to get this camera after having used a Sony Cybershot basic point and shoot camera for several years.  This may be attributable to my lack of photography skills but I am having a terrible time getting consistently good pictures and the instructions in the brief manual aren't very helpful.  Many of the pictures are blurry, particularly if I use the zoom feature.  Also, I have no idea when the flash will operate once I open it and when shooting into a completely dark room sometimes it will work (in which case the pictures are crystal clear and beautiful) and other times nothing.  There is an indicator for flash on the top right side of the camera but it never lights up on mine.  I went online to look for a more detailed manual but it appeared to be the same thing.  Should I return it or is this simply a learning curve issue?  I am taking a trip to the Caribbean next month and don't want to risk not being able to get consistently beautiful pics -- please help!  Thanks so much.""
"20120522","5.0","great looking camera","I think I am really pleased with this camera, looks easy to set up and use.  Disappointed with the fact I didn't see the bundle pack, because I thought this came with the memory card and case.""
"20120522","5.0","NIKON COOLPIX","GREAT CAMERA, EASY TO USE. LOVE THE COLOR OF THIS CAMERA (BLUE). WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE. I REALLY LIKE THE ZOOM.""
"20120521","4.0","Great Camera","This is my first Coolpix camera and I have only taken a few shots with it so far but it seems to be in focus with every shot just as long as you follow the directions I do not anticipate any issues. The one thing that I do not like is that it does not come with a free editing software like the Fuji cameras do or I would have given it at least five stars.""
"20120517","3.0","Its okay if you have nothing important to take pics of","Very Unhappy. Thought this might be a cheaper way to get the quality of a true DSLR, and I was mistaken. This picture was purchased to help capture the trip of a lifetime, and so many of my pictures returned slightly out of focus. I had read the manual, and was ready for the trip. On our trip we had so many missed pictures because I would hold down the capture button and sometimes it would take a few seconds to actually click  or not at all. Further more, whenever a photo was zoomed in the camera would refuse to focus properly at least 80% of the time. I know people said well you have to hold it halfway to focus and then click it, but it hardly ever held focus. I thought it may be a user error, but it seems that I'm not the only one who's ever had this problem with this camera. My husband tinkered with it quite a while and it was useless. A camera that can't hold a focus is ridiculous. We have so many perfectly framed pictures that just are as enjoyable because its fuzzy/grainy and slightly out of focus. I'm returning mine and just going all out for a great camera.Maybe if you can accept mediocre pictures, but I want quality.""
"20120517","1.0","This camera is not worth the money. It's going back to the store","I just got this camera for my 50th birthday. I was so excited to get it until I actually got it up and running. First off the computer software included would not download kept getting a tiny screen that says press next but no next was seen on the screen could not make the pop up larger so that ticked me off right off the get go. The memory card goes in with the batteries??? Its hard to open and close correctly stupid. The 4 batteries it takes makes the camera heavy. The flash has to be popped up manually and then you have to push a button each time for the flash to actually work. All my photos came out like crap. Tried different settings, increased the light still pictures looked horrible. This camera is going back. I'll stick to my 10 year old kodak which doesn't take the best photos anymore but it's a 100 times easier to operate,lighter and it has a docking station.  Very disappointed with this camera.""
"20120514","5.0","coolpix l810","I got for my wife to take pictures of her flowers. She was surprised that the camera was small and light weight. She took pictures with it and was amazed at the quality and sharpness. Very pleased with the camera""
"20120513","5.0","Love!","This camera was something that I was dying to get.  I've had a very old, 8 year old in fact, Coolpix camera that still works but it's so old that I hate using it.  The time in between taking one picture and the next if you need the flash is horrendous.  So I finally went on the search to revamp my camera owning.  And I found the Nikon Coolpix L810.I have to admit what I really wanted was something close enough to a professional photographers camera.  I take pictures everywhere I go.  Especially with my son.  I also don't buy photographer pictures, I tend to do them myself and they always turn out really well.  But I wanted a camera that could take that even further. When I read that this camera could take pictures that were professional grade I was pretty sold.  Not to mention that it came in colors.  I love color choices!  It just makes everything a little bit more fun.Upon recieving it, I read the manual and figured out how to use it.  It takes a little time to figure out exactly how to.  Because you don't just go clicking away like most cameras.  You hold the capture button half way down.  There is a small square on the screen that will turn green when your camera is properly focused.  That is when you press the capture button down completely to capture a picture that is not blurred.  You can 'snap snap' but sometimes you will get blurry pictures because the camera takes pictures so fast if you don't focus you will get blur.It doesn't have any problems with the lens cap.  If you forget to take it off a message on the screen informs you to turn off your camera, take the lens cap off, and try again.  Which was nice because I have  heard of people ruining their motor because they left their lens cap on.  There are two places to zoom on the camera depending on how you hold it.  On the top and on the side, which is really handy.  It does take video though I haven't tried that yet.I was also worried about the size of the pictures.  How much room they would take up on a memory card.  I bought a 16GB card and haven't had to stop taking pictures yet.  In fact, I went to the zoo took over 80 pictures and still only came to 300mb.  So I am extremely pleased with that as well.  I have already recommended it to a friend that is interested in a nicer camera.Definatly worth the purchase.""
"20120508","5.0","DSLR","This camera gives you the feel of a DSLR without having to take along any extra equipment. The pictures are crystal clear and it is easy to use. The 26x gives more than adequate zoom range. I got the blue color as a tribute to my now deceased mother as blue was her favorite color.""
"20120508","5.0","Excellent so far","I just received this camera and am wonderfully surprised.  Wanted a better camera without having photography knowledge.  This camera is awesome just using it in the auto mode.  I am so pleased with the functions and the results.  I can't wait to continue using it.  Wish I would have known it came with a strap, I wouldn't have bought one.""
"20120505","5.0","Excellent camera","It takes excellent pictures and is easy to use. There are some features i would like to see like in other models, for example pause video recording.""
"20120505","2.0","Not happy","I bought this camera as my son is graduating this year. I used it for his senior prom pictures, which turned out okay but not great. This past week I tried to use it for an indoor chorus concert, which it sucked for. I have had this for a month and so far am not impressed at all. Really hoping that it takes some decent pictures for his high school graduation- it has let me down so far !""
"20120502","1.0","Doesnt work","I turned the camera on 3 times and now it will not work. I haven't put a memory card in it yet!  I went and bought new batteries and still it keeps telling me to remove the lens cover.  I needed this camera to take pictures at my daughters play. I paid extra to get it next day. I am so disappointed!5/8/2012 I got a replacement camera and it is working great!!! So far I love it! Now it deserves 5 stars!""
"20120429","2.0","not awesome","When it did take pics they were great ,most of the time you had to take several to get a good one. When I go to zoom a message would come up turn camera off and remove lens.(and yes the lens was off) Might have gotten a camera with a defect, but I am not the only one.""
"20120419","5.0","Nikon Camera","I wanted a good camera with high resolution at a decent price - I found it with the COOLPIX. I am very pleased thus far.""
"20120419","5.0","Love it with my add-ons","I was very happy to see this camera finally come out.  I have been using it for about a month now and I am very happy.  I read a review about the images being out of focus and I simply took the picture again with the flash on or with the camera on a different setting.  The application that comes with the camera let you view the pictures with great clarity.  I bought and would suggest the following 2 items to go along with the camera:Nikon CoolPix L810 HDMI Cable - HD Video Cable for Nikon CoolPix L810, which lets me hook up to my tv in HDMI or even my computer through HDMI.andEnergizer CHP4WB4 Recharge Smart AA/AAA Charger with 4 AA NiMH Batteries, along with n extra 4 pack.Bottom line is I really enjoy this camera.""
"20120418","4.0","nice camera!","I bought this camera a month ago and so far I am pretty satisfied. The only thing is that I would have preferred to have rechargeable batteries instead of the regularones. Pictures nice and clear but sometimes when a picture is done is out of focus...I am not sure if it's me or the camera.In conclusion, it was a nice buy!""
"20120408","5.0","Amazing Camera","This camera is amazing. I recently went to a Pittsburgh Penguins game and was blown away by the quality of the pictures. I took a pro quality picture of the goal from the other size of the arena and I can see his eyes its so clear and crisp. Totally worth the price. One must figure out how to use it by experimenting. The pictures will be blurry if u don't. This camera is not a simple point and shoot.""
"20120331","5.0","i love this camera","Okay first of all i love the 26x zoom and second i love the 16.1 mp. I recently went to the zoo and took pictures that were making professional photographers mad because of the clarity and at full zoom. Side by side comparison told me i did the right thing in purchasing this camera. And for those of you that think somethings wrong with the camera just spend some time using all the different scenes and adjustment's this camera has. one more thing i really liked was the ability to just push the video button to record video instead of having to change modes...and it doesn't matter what size sd card you have it will only record 29 min at a time, you can record multiple 29 min video's.... take it as you will.""
"20120329","3.0","Nice camera for kids...","If you are going to spend almost $300 for a this camera, I would recommendyour go for the Panasonic Lumix MSC FZ150 for a few hundred more.  Thiscamera isn't quite ready for primetime, the zoom is jerky and it kept comingup with 'battery exhausted', plus only records for 29 minutes, regardless ofhow many GB's you have available.If you want a REALLY GOOD CAMERA that will run circles around this one andzillion of options, fantastic pictures and 1080P video, the Lumix is the one.You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it.  Sue me, if I'm wrong.Panasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom (Black) $489.00  32X Zoom....I took a picture of my hallway, with nothing on but a nightlight and itcame out great!  Excellent low light camera.""
"20120329","1.0","Most pictures out of focus","I have owned three of the Nikon L model camera's, the L100, L110, and L120.  I love this model because it takes regular AA batteries and is very easy to hold and take photos with one hand.  I'm a real estate appraiser and use these camera's on the job.  The L100 was pretty good, the L110 was not worth the upgrade and the L120 is pretty near perfect for my needs.  They all focused relatively quickly and rarely were out of focus.  I wanted just a tad more speed taking a picture when I pressed the shutter release button (focus lock) and a tad wider angle, so I bought the new L810.  What a waste of money.  My camera may be defective because so many things are wrong with it.  I noticed right away that it won't take 1024x768 (1M) photos.  This is the size I prefer to take pictures of houses for my appraisal reports due to their small size.  Secondly, I immediately noticed that it didn't always take a photo after pressing the shutter release mechanisms.  It wasn't getting focus lock or something, I'm not sure.  It took two, sometimes three, presses of the shutter release button before it would take a photo.  I've timed it and it'll take three to five full seconds of continueously holding down the shutter button before it'll snap a picture.  Then when I got home and transferred the photos to my PC, more disappointment, nearly all the photos were ever so slightly out of focus.  These were for pictures taking outdoors in the daytime.  I'm returning the camera and going back to my reliable Nikon L120.""
"20120328","5.0","SO HAPPY!!!!","I ordered this camera because of a few reasons first of all I love the Nikon brand I already own a small pocket camera but I loved the SLR style too so when I found this one I fell in love with it and I just got it this week (I ordered it Thursday morning and it was in my hand by Tuesday afternoon, with the regular shipping 3-6 days) I've been playing with it ever since it takes great pictures and I can't wait to use it for some big family events I got coming up ...........THANKS NIKON I LOVE YOUR PRODUCTS!!!!""
