"20120611","5.0","Olympus TG-310 Waterproof Camera","Bought this camera for my 17 year old daughter. She loves it. She has taken it to summer camp. It has been in the lake, the pool, and hiking. It is tough. Everyone has passed it around and used it. It works great.""
"20120610","3.0","Returning","I bought this camera to take on vacation to Jamaica two weeks ago. The picture quality is surprisingly nice, even underwater it's crystal clear. Besides that, it took about 30 seconds to get the camera to turn on each time I wanted to use it, which is a pain and causes a lot of missed picture opportunities, especially when snorkeling and fish are swimming by. You can't leave the camera on for a few minutes or take successive pictures or the battery will immediately drain. Even when fully charged, battery life is disappointing.I properly used the camera in shallow depths of water and cleaned/air dried it, but there would be condensation on the lens that shows up on pictures and really takes away from it.Just not what I would expect from an Olympus camera, so I'll probably buy a more expensive model.""
"20120607","4.0","The little camera that could","This is the little camera that can take a beating and keep on ticking.  I bought this camera when I thought that it was completely waterproof (not to just 10') and took it on my honeymoon to Scuba Dive in the Dominican Republic.  While I didn't take the camera on deep dives, it survived snorkeling and bouncing off rocks just fine.  I have lots of great under water photos.  Plus we did an adventure trip of scaling up a series of 7 waterfalls.  This involved (wet) rock climbing and swimming.  The whole time I just had my camera's wrist strap attached to the buckle of my life vest.  Beautiful photos every time.Downsides:1) I do recommend buying a spare battery and charger for the camera.  Each battery seems to only last for about 5-6 hours of constant use.  Also leaving the battery in the camera over night seems to drain the battery a little.  Always start each day with a fresh fully charges battery.2) The camera is not that good long distance shots indoors.  Outside it is great and close up indoors it is good.3) It is also not the best at action shots.  Like most inexpensive digital cameras there is a delay between clicking the button and when the actual picture is taken.  Plus the photos tend to be blurry if there is too much movement.""
"20120607","2.0","Broke in one week","It's hard to operate the zoom and the trigger, after one week I got water inside the camera and knew about that because a malfunction in the memory card, It's stopped working.""
"20120605","4.0","It survived my Jamaica trip","I just came back from a Jamaica trip.  I took the camera for the first time to snorkeling, zip-lining, beach and pool.  It took decent outdoor and underwater pictures and video.  It did not experience any leakage.  I followed the included olympus instructions on cleaning the camera after each underwater use and it has not been failing.  It is truth that it is slow on startup and taking pictures but for the price and what it can do in water, this point and shoot camera is great!""
"20120603","1.0","Waterproof???","I took pictures before it got wet and they were decent enough.  But after one dip in the water, there was clearly water inside the camera and I eeked out about 8 foggy shots before it shut down completely.  What a waste of money.  Do NOT take a chance on this one!!!  I missed some great shots of a lifetime trusting the Olympus name.  It's going back ----I used to LOVE Olympus, but this has put me off.""
"20120601","1.0","Bought 2.  Both failed in short order.","I purchased 2 of these within days of each other. The first one never worked (right out of the box). The second on lasted 5-months before it went haywire. Dealing with Olympus to get them repaired was quite cumbersome. Maybe I just got 2 lemons. But, I would never buy again.""
"20120529","1.0","Waterproof? Hah!","If it were truly waterproof, this would be a... fairly ordinary point-and-shoot digital camera, a bit slow to boot, a bit slow to record an image, a bit awkward to zoom (the buttons are hard to work and it tends to overshoot), a bit clumsy to change settings (you have to go through a lot of button presses to change things that would be a quick turn of a knob on another camera), and a bit less picture quality than you'd expect from 14 megapixels and 780p. But, it would be worth it to get a ruggedized, waterproof camera in this price range.Alas, this camera isn't waterproof. It's not even weatherproof, in the sense that it can't even tolerate the splashing that occurs during a canoe trip on a class 1 river (class 1 is one notch up from dead calm, for those not into whitewater terminology). Twenty minutes into its first use in the boat, the display, flash and (most important) lens window were fogging up on the inside. Two days later they are still fogged.The camera shop where I bought this item (I'd intended to buy in on Amazon, but they offered to match price) says it's 6-to-8 weeks to fix it... assuming Olympus will fix the thing (my past experience with the Olympus warranty department is that they view any problem as proof that you must have violated the terms of the warranty in some way). So much for capturing summer fun in the water... not that I'm going to trust it when it comes back, anyway. Once bitten twice shy and all that. Back to the disposable waterproof film cameras, I guess... they don't take movies and you have to wait for prints, but at least they usually don't leak.""
"20120519","5.0","Camera for the beach","I got this camera to take to the beaches around Oahu and to do some snorkeling with it. As soon as I got the camera I took some pictures around the house to get familiar with it and learn all the different modes and settings. I took it to the beach and walked straight into the ocean with it! I took several scenery pictures and even tried out the panoramic mode. The panoramic mode was alright but if you know how to use photoshop you would probably make a better picture that way. In the panoramic mode not all my pictures matched up even though I lined up the circles on the screen. I took a few underwater pictures but because the waves were rough that day all you could see was sand. After I got home I washed off the camera to make sure I got all the salt and sand off of it before opening the door to download my pictures. I looked at my pictures on my computer and zoomed in a bit and the pictures were clear and had no grain like a previous review on this product had stated. Over all I think this is a great camera especially if you are wanting to go on a vacation where you will see a lot of sea life or just want a tough camera to take a beating.""
"20120515","2.0","Painful lesson learned...","Never buy a new camera and take it on the trip of a lifetime without trying it out first! Ended up just hating this camera as I struggled to take action pics from our double-decker bus tour in Barcelona. The balky thing came super close to being slammed off the top of the bus as I missed shot after shot struggling w/ the non-responsive zoom buttons. We bought a 'tough' camera since we figured we might drop it accidentally at some point and didn't want that to be all she wrote. But I felt that a massive amount of responsiveness was lost in the 'shockproof' rubberized backing covering the buttons. I have to say that I would never use it again if I had the choice. My husband didn't mind it but he's not that into photo taking. I was very disappointed and I'm not a very tech-y kind of person.""
"20120515","5.0","Best Under water camera ever!!!!","I just used this camera for my JAMAICA trip and it worked amazingly!!! I was suprised. Pictures so crisp and clear and amazing color. Captures all under water action. Extremely excellent camera! I would recomment this camera to anyone!""
"20120514","4.0","Great Camera","I was a little hesitant about buying this camera based on the low price, however, it had good reviews, so I thought I would give it a try.  I mainly wanted it for it's waterproof abilities as I wanted to take pictures and videos in the pool/beach of my kids.  Once I received it, it took very little to get all set up to my perferences.  I'm by no means 'techy' and it was quite simple.  Then I tried it out in the pool taking pictures and videos of the kiddos playing around and it worked perfectly.  The video and pictures came out terrific.  So I wanted to give it a try on just normal pictures too and I must say, it takes pretty darn good normal pictures too.  The only thing that I would knock it for is that underwater the LCD screen is sometimes hard to see if it's bright out.  Overall, I would definitely purchase this camera again.  I hope it lives up to it's 'Tough' namesake and lasts awhile!""
"20120509","5.0","Another great Olympus product","I have become a die hard Olympus digital camera fan.  I've used them underwater, either with housings in the old days, or now two types of these 'tough Series' of cameras.  This one was bought for the office to take pictures of events.  Employees are not the most careful with company property, so having a camera which is dustproof, waterproof, can be dropped to the floor without harm, and can be stepped on without harm; gives me a lot of peace of mind.  Can't do anything about it being 'theftproof' but at these low prices I will just have to take that chance.""
"20120504","5.0","Worked as advertised","This camera was underwater with me for hours while I floated and still works perfectly.  This camera fell out of a basket of a moving bike and still works perfectly.  Very pleased so far.  Be careful when buying a spare battery. The manual is for 2 different models that use 2 different battery sizes.  This one uses an LI42B.""
"20120503","5.0","Great Little Camera!","Just got back from Nassau and this camera worked great! It was used snorkeling, waterslides (at Atlantis Resort) and the pool and never encountered any problems. I think the secret with any waterproof camera is to thoroughly rinse and/or soak in fresh water after use in the ocean or pool. Overall I'm very pleased with this camera.""
"20120501","4.0","Great Value / Good Pictures","I bought this after the new model was released, so I'm reviewing this as a $129 camera. At this price it is a great value for a waterproof camera. With good light, the pictures are really very good. With low light the pictures are still decent though noise is noticeable. It is easy to use, though with the small lens, even the tiniest drop of water will ruin the picture, so you must keep wiping the water. Most of these waterproof point-and-shoot cameras would probably share this problem. Yet it's a lot easier to wipe off the water than it is to keep a waterproof case on better camera from fogging. And at $129, it's about half the cost of a waterproof case on a really good camera.""
"20120425","4.0","Great underwater point and shoot","Took it on holiday to Mexico over spring break. Great for snorkeling and playing around in the water. Does a fine job with HD movies, too. Works fine in and out of the water. The separate movie button was nice (instead of switching to movie mode and pressing the shutter release button like on other cameras, you just press a record button on the back of the camera).Only downside was the sort of short battery life. It didn't last a day of taking 50 or 100 pictures and a few short movies. I think I'll purchase a second battery, which will easily get me through a day.""
"20120424","4.0","Not bad.","Stand up to the reputation for ruggedness, and it is a satisfactory point and shoot pocket camera with one exception - the delay between button push and the picture being taken can sometimes be as great as a full second and a half.  This is a bit annoying.""
"20120422","5.0","Camera and price paid are fantabulous!","I love this camera!  Pictures taken are fantabulous in or out of water.  I did download an example of both type of pictures, in a previous review.""
"20120418","5.0","works well under water","I know some people have complained about water leakage but I think that was operator error. My kids love theirs.""
"20120416","4.0","Great camera for the money, but very limited battery life.","Survived 3 snorkeling trips and took lots of other great pictures on our vacation last week. Pretty easy to use. The '?' feature made it easy to find the right mode to take pictures in different situations, and the results were mostly really good.The only problem was the battery life sucks! Ordered an extra battery when I bought the camera, but Amazon recommended the wrong one, so it didn't work. Also, Olympus uses an odd shaped cord, so I couldn't use any other USB cord to charge. Missed a lot of photo opportunities because of that. I plan to get an extra cord and another battery before I use the camera again for an extended period.""
"20120331","4.0","worked great underwater","I bought this camera to use while snorkeling in Hawaii.  I didn't have any problems with it, except the fish were too fast for me!  I got great shots of a sea turtle, however.  The color of the photos appears to be very saturated and water shots both above and below the surface turn out very blue.  I snorkeled for a couple of hours before the battery died, so it is better than a cheaper camera using AA batteries.  It also shoots in video, zoom mode, and wide angle 'stitch together' mode.  I'm sure there are better models out there, but for the money this was a good deal instead of buying disposables.""
"20120327","5.0","Awesome!","I absolutely love this camera! I love the fact that I don't have to worry about getting it wet. I am a college swimmer and am constantly around water so this has been great. I also took it on spring break with me to PCB and I never had to worry about getting salt water on it. The only thing that bugs me some times is that it will take some blurry photos if you don't let it focus first. You have to press part way down on the button to let it focus and then push it all the way down.""
"20120320","4.0","310 Olympus Camera SNORKEL COMPANION","I bought this for my husband to use in Hawaii when we snorkeled (I have the 8010)  He loved that it is so light weight and easy to use under water. Its nice to have the record button on the front rather than going into the options and selecting to record. this way you can record a video, then when you stop it, go right back to snapping pictures again! We love this camera, it took great pictures....However..It was LOCKED and went black. we thought it was the battery (the battery does get sucked down pretty quickly. you can purchase additional batteries and chargers cheap though, we paid $20 for 2 additional batteries and a wall charger).  When we went to change the battery we saw that the camera had leaked water into the battery area and the screen in the front fogged up inside. TOTAL BUMMER since our trip wasnt over yet. And of course, our 30 day warranty was up 2 days before this happened (the store is still giving us exchange credit though phew). I have not seen reviews saying anyone else has had this problem, so we are using our store credit to re-purchase this camera and hope to have better luck this time!""
"20120315","5.0","Very Pleased!","This camera is awesome.  Going on a cruise and needed something durable and waterproof, yet small.  It has many shooting modes to play around with and I think it's easy to navigate around the menu/settings.  I was skeptical about this purchase because I read some reviews about the battery door opening accidentally while using and the camera getting ruined when using it underwater.  Those were the first things that I tested before the cruise to make sure there weren't any defects.The battery door has a recessed switch in order to open it.  You can also lock the door by moving the same switch into a cut out that is 90 degrees to the main travel path so in order to open it accidentally you have to unlock it first.  I don't see how I will be able to do that the way I hold my camera.I submerged the camera underwater while taking HD 720p video and the waterproof feature works great.  Make sure to read all the directions.  You need to rinse any sand and salt water off the camera before opening it.  The sand and salt could be trapped underneath the battery door gasket and prevent you from getting a water tight seal.  Maybe that's why some people were having issues.My only complaint is that it did not come with any external SD memory card.  I did however have a spare one so I wasn't without.If you're looking for a small durable camera that takes good pictures this is for you.  If you're looking to take high quality photos get a DSLR.  No point and shoot camera will give you that quality until they make those lenses small enough to fit in a compact design.""
"20120311","4.0","The camera is exactly what you'll expect it to be","Good quality photos & video, even under water.  When its sunny out it can be really hard to see the screen, so that can make taking pictures difficult. I love the face recognition & there are settings to recognize cats & dogs faces as well so you can get a good shot of them if you can keep their attention! Easy to use, help function will take you through whatever you dont understand. Great quality for the money.""

The mud run is still a month away but tested on the ski slopes and it did great.  I even took it to the pool and let my kids play with.  This camera is better than I thought it would be considering the price.  I feel comfortable recommending it.""

Nothing like any of the canon's I've had. I think you could have the shakes and get a sharp picture with a canon this camera however even using a tripod my pictures were fuzzy. It's will be the last time I ever by a non canon or nikon camera. There is a reason why those are the only 2 companies that make professional camera. They know what they are doing. I thought I could save myself a few bucks with this but no such luck. it's going back!""
"20120102","5.0","Great compact waterproof camera","I rated this camera 5 stars because I was looking for a waterproof, compact camera that takes decent pictures.  This camera does all of that.  I'm not comparing it with a full size digital SLR.  And for under $140 with free shipping from Amazon, it's a good deal.I bought this camera for a trip to the Caribbean.  It was in the water several times, up to 4 feet deep.  It worked flawlessly and stayed bone dry.  Be sure to rinse it in clean tap water, wait for it to dry completely before opening.The shell is aluminum which makes it heavy duty.  The exposures and colors are fairly accurate even indoors with flash.  Sharpness is adequate for this type of camera.  I'm particularly impressed with the quality of the pictures in the macro mode.  There are 2 things that I don't like:1. In the battery saving mode, the screen turns off after only about 2 seconds, making it a little annoying.  To turn it back on, you press lightly on the shutter release.  You can turn off this mode but cannot extend the time.2. It does not come with an external battery charger.  The battery has to be charged while inside the camera.  I solved this problem by buying an external charger from eBay.  You may also consider getting a second battery for convenience.The controls are small so if you have big fingers or wear gloves, you may have difficulty.  But again, this is a compact camera that fits in your shirt pocket.The manufacturer says that you need to replace the waterproof seal once a year but that's true for all waterproof cameras.  I find that the seal will last a longer if you leave the battery door open during storage.  That way there's not constant pressure on the seal.I purchased this camera at the same time as the Panasonic Lumix TS3.  Although both cameras are about the same, the Olympus' pictures are a lot sharper that of the Panasonic.  I was surprised because the Panasonic had a Leica lens and cost more.  Figure that!""
"20120101","4.0","very nice little camera","I bought this camera for my upcoming trip to Bahias de Huatulco where I was planning to do some snorkeling and wanted to take pictures and videos. Overall it is a very nice little camera, compact, easy to use, has image stabilizer and takes vibrant sharp pictures in the water and out of it. it seems that underwater videos look better than still photos. It is very easy to switch between still photo and video. The battery lasts between 2.5 and 3 hours when the camera is continually used so I was glad I purchased additional battery.The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that this camera does not float nor does it come with a detachable buoy or something. I was looking forward to sharing my awesome vacation pics and videos with family, alas the camera drowned (!). On the last day of the trip I was getting on the boat after snorkeling and put the camera on the deck. It has slipped and drowned taking ALL of my vacation mementos with it (I wasn't smart enough to use multiple memory cards:(I liked the cam so much that I am considering purchasing a replacement. I will purchase a detachable flotation device for it though.""
"20111228","5.0","Great for the cold","We took this camera to an ice festival in North Pole Ak and was able to take photos during the entire outing.  I didn't have any problem with the battery dying or the cold getting to the camera at -12 degrees.  My young daughter dropped it in the snow and it continued to take great pictures.  Last year my expensive Nikon didn't make it only 30 minutes before freezing up.  I look forward to using it on our trip to Hawaii.  I suggest this camera to anyone going to the snow.""
"20111228","5.0","Good Underwater Camera - Leaked but repaired with warranty","I purchased this camera after thoroughly researching underwater cameras for a trip to the Galapagos where I would spend 8 days on a boat and really no access to civilization. I needed something that would be durable, something that could be dropped in case I was clumsy, something that could take pictures underwater as well as out of the water in case I saw something on the water's surface, easy to use-- I wasn't going to fiddle with settings, could take video in case sea lions wanted to play with me in the water, could go underwater at least 10 feet (even though I only float on the water's surface, I know that I'll be sticking my arm out with the camera so you have to account for some of that), and couldn't have external moving parts becuase I didn't want sand to get caught in the parts or chances for the moving parts to get bumped and broken. You could easily spend $300-$400 for an underwater camera with these features. I ultimately decided that I wouldn't spend more than $175 because I had to budget for the trip. I was taking my big digital SLR camera so I could take high quality out-of-water pictures so I didn't need the best overall camera. BTW, I purchased the orange color because I wanted something bright that would stick out in almost any condition in case I dropped it or needed to find it.After deciding on this camera, I called Olypus to find out what the most common user errors were that caused the camera to malfunction. The rep said it was usually hair or dust that would get caught between the water seals and the camera.I tested the camera in the pool and handed the camera to my 4 year old to take pictures. I wanted to make sure it didn't leak and could take any bumps my child would expose to the camera. My son didn't ever drop the camera or bump it, but the camera was easy enough for him to push the shutter button and the screen large enough for him to see what pictures he was taking. After testing in the pool, I felt I could take the camera on my trip.I was able to use the camera on 3 snorkeling trips. I used it on land on the beach for a few shots of a ghost crab and some sea lions. I used the camera's auto setting and the picture seemed a bit bright. For the underwater shots, I used the camera's underwater mode. The pictures were slighly dark, so days that didn't have bright sunlight in the water looked ok, but if there's heavy clouds, you may not be able to see anything in your pictures unless the objects are very close. You may be better off using the auto setting and then color correcting the pictures on your computer for underwater pictures-- but I haven't had a chance to test this out.I recharged the battery to the fullest after every trip. Before closing up the camera's side, I made sure that there wasn't anything (hair, sand, dust) on the seals and in the way of the seals. I always made sure the side's button was in the locked position before I got anywhere near water. After snorkeling trips, I rinsed the camera per the instructions and always let it air dry with the side open. I didn't want anything to happen to this camera during this once in a lifetime trip.On my 4th snorkeling trip, I took a few pictures then my camera turned off. I wasn't able to get the camera to come back on during that trip. When I got back on the boat, I tried recharging the battery because there was no other indication that something else was wrong after taking out the battery and visual camera inspection. When I went back to check on my camera after a couple of hours, I noticed condensation inside the screen. I tried turning on the camera and it still didn't work.I had read other people were able to air out their cameras and it worked later. I left the camera's side door open for a full day to dry and took out the battery. I did not try to charge it during this time because another tourist said that electrical currents could make it worse, especially since it leaked with salt water. One day of air drying and still no luck. I tried every day there after to air dry and turn it on, but it didn't work for the rest of my trip. Which is too bad because I missed out on sharks, manta rays, and penguins.When I arrived home, I turned on the camera and it actually came on for one second then turned itself off. I wasn't able to get the camera to stay on. I tried submitted an online warrant request, but the website didn't work correctly. I called Olympus customer service and she said sometimes the website's online form didn't work correctly. The rep was very nice and polite. I explained what happened and she directed me to a link to print out a form. She gave me a case number and told me to put it on the form when I filled it out. I mailed the camera with the form, a copy of the warranty that came in the original Olympus box, battery, and cables. I received the camera in less than 2 weeks! Wow! They mailed it back via UPS and the box was smashed, opened, taped, and had holes in the box. I was very concerned that the camera was damaged from UPS. I was able to turn on the camera, but haven't had a chance to really test it since I just received the camera yesterday. The paperwork included with my camera said they replaced the circuit board and screen. I am thoroughly impressed with the customer service. I had an excellent experience with Olympus and feel bad for the others that had poor experience.I would give Olympus a 5 star for customer service and a 4.0 star for the actual functionality and utility of the camera. I notched down the 1 star because the camera's pre-set settings for underwater and sunny day seems to be slightly off on exposure, and the camera leaked during the trip. If I had purchased one of those $300 cameras, the exposure issue would have knocked off more than a star, but given the cost of this Olympus, I'm not going to be that picky. Overall, the camera does it's job. Yes, there was the leakage issue and I wished that it didn't happen (I'm still bummed about the missed pictures), but I was able to get some pictures at the beginning of my trip and there was virtually no hassle with getting it repaired.""
"20111219","4.0","Would Recommend","Bought this camera on a cruise ship, and it broke after one day, the view screen was broken, so took it back and exchanged it for a new one.  The new one works great...still have a little hesitation with the 'shock resistance' (considering we didn't drop the camera the first day).  Had the chance to use it underwater in the pool and the ocean...takes great pics, very vivid and beautiful! The panoramic setting is less than ideal, it takes 3 separate pictures and then 'weaves' them together, but if it is a scenery shot (like over the ocean) it is hard to line up the shot.  Wish that was a little different but when you can line it up correctly the panoramic turns out GREAT!!! :)I would recommend this camera! (just make sure where you buy it has a return/exchange policy or get the warranty for extra protection)""

We have a few other cameras, including a dSLR but I have missed having this little camera around.  So, today I bought it again, and I am sure we will get as much enjoyment from this one as we did before.When using it underwater, remember to soak it in fresh water after for about 10 minutes so it isn't harmed by the salt or chlorine.""
"20111216","5.0","Love it!","I love this camera! I needed a new one because my old digital camera was about 7 years old and this works so much faster and easier. I also love the color! I've noticed though that pictures on the screen do look a little grainy but when they're uploaded onto the computer everything looks perfect. I think that has something to do with the screen being water proof. Speaking of waterproof, I still haven't tested my camera under water because I don't get many chances to do that up here. But I wanted a tough camera that could stand to be thrown around and that's exactly what I got. It's been dropped a couple times already and there's no scratches, which is  great because I definitely don't want it to look like my old camera did! :)""

Although the picture quality is OK(around 10-ish megapixels if you ask me) it's enough for it's original purpose, to go underwater(take abuse, etc.) and still be able to take pictures.  I am bringing this awesome little camera to the cruise in which I am going on in a few weeks and I know all of my friends will be jealous.  The great part about this camera is that the charger works on USB so I can charge it with my phone, and my iPod Touch(I bought adapters for all of these).  The video is OK, and the pictures are pretty good.  The flash is nice and bright and all of the settings(ISO and exposure and more)certainly help.  Although it's not the best camera in the world and doesn't take the best pictures or videos in the world they are still good enough to crop and print out for a nice clear picture and this is SO WORTH it for the price considering some of the 'better cameras' are over $250.  The buttons are OK because most of them click so you know you've pushed them and they are all pretty responsive.  I WAS a LITTLE worried about the zoom because those don't click but they are still very responsive.  NOTE: They work a little better on mine if you push a little toward the middle of the zoom panel.Also, the zoom is only 3.6X but that is enough for me because I will pretty much only be using this is for it's main purpose, the take pictures underwater.  The screen size is pretty good, considering it is such a minute camera.Overall, great camera for the price as I have said a few times already in this review.  Hope this helped future buyers out there.Thanks for your time,Jasmine""
"20111209","5.0","Great little camera","Bought one of these 4 months ago for my grandaughter who is 16, and she hasn't been able to hurt it yet! This one is for my daughter-in-law, as she kills cameras all the time. And I plan on buying one for myself. Great little camera!""
"20111122","5.0","Love this camera","I purchased the Olympus TG-310 on a cruise when I dropped a broke my camera.  It was my first waterproof camera and I was really impressed with the price and what it could do.  WARNING:  Make sure to LOCK the camera when you are using it in and under water.  I did not and the second day of owning it I got it filled with salt water and couldn't use it for the rest of the trip.  Thankfully, Olympus stayed true to their warranty and when I arrived home from the cruise sent it in to get fixed, free of charge.  Good company and good camera!  Very happy with my purchase.""
"20111110","5.0","Excellent Camera....","Good product and high quality. Easy to use , resistant , waterproof.It has several features they've found awesome and helpful.This is my second camera of the Stylus Tough series.""
"20111107","5.0","Great in and out of water!","Was really impressed that it took good, recognizable photos under water. Out of the water, it's pretty darn good too. If what you want outside is too bright or dark, tilt the camera up or down and when it exposes correctly, hold in your take button half way, tilt back down to your pic, and click it the rest of the way! My only complaint is that it needs a little more contrast and saturation. I just opened the pics with Windows Live Photo Gallery, and hit auto-fix, which fixed most of them great. If not, bump up the saturation or contrast. Easy fix!""
"20111027","3.0","Good for "tough" situations but not the best all-around","I received this camera as a gift after we went rafting in the Grand Canyon and a fellow rafter had the same camera.  We backpack and kayak frequently and this is a great camera to take along, being resistant to most dirt and water.  The downside of the camera is the quality of photos.  Unless it is a clear blue day with optimal lighting, the pictures are grainy.  Any movement and the photo is blurred.  While I love it's durability (I do not want to take my SLR on a kayak!)it is not my 'all around, go to' camera. We save this one for only extreme situations but for the price, it does quite nicely.""
"20111021","4.0","Boa compra","M&aacute;quina muito boa, f&aacute;cil de usar, fotos &oacute;timas embaixo d'&aacute;gua. Poderia vir com acess&oacute;rios como capa, pulseira flutuante e cartão de mem&oacute;ria. Estou satisfeito com a compra.""
"20111006","2.0","Waterproof? Maybe. Camera? Definitely not.","I had an old Panasonic Lumix that someone gave me for free cos it was banged up and didn't work properly. After a bit of TLC, I got it working and it served me beautifully for the last 4 years. 2 months ago it died finally. Decided to buy this Tough TG-310, cos it seemed like it could take a bit of punishment and still survive.I have not yet tested this thing in any challenging conditions, all I've done is take photos and videos. Extremely disappointed with the quality of the HD videos. Very grainy for 720p, if my old Lumix was 10/10, then this would be no more than 3/10.The photos are acceptable if the conditions are right, but it's very disapointing that if I want to make acceptable quality videos, I need to use my bulky Camcorder.""
"20110927","4.0","Terrific Buy!","I bought this camera and floating case prior to a cruise with some friends and it is WORTH EVERY PENNY.  We swam with stingrays, snorkeled, explored caves, kayaked, and hung out in the pool and got terrific pictures without having to worry about damaging the camera.  Features are easy-to-use and can also do panoramic photos; battery life is a bit limited but I solved this by buying a second battery--extremely afforadable on Amazon.  Takes great pictures EVEN UNDERWATER (I used a 8gig memory card and saved all photos on the highest resolution so they'll print out suitable for hanging up at home later) and good indoor/non adventure kind of pictures.  Downside: lengthy time between when you push the button and when the photo actually takes.""
"20110906","5.0","This camera is amazing for the price!","I am really pleased with this camera. I have bought all different types of cameras and this one is a great camera for the price. My daughter is a photographer and she has an older model of this camera and loves it. She uses it just as a point and shoot since she doesn't want to lug her SLR camera everywhere. We liked the waterproof, shatterproof and freezeproof qualities. She normally only has a camera last for a year or so due to dropping it or getting it wet and this one has lasted over 2 years. So happy I took her advice and found this at such a great price.""
"20110902","5.0","Olympus TG-310 Digital Camera","I bought this camera for my girlfriend for kayaking and she loves it.  She hasn't touched her 12 MP Olympus Stylus since she got this.  She loves all of the extra modes to take pictures in, like the watercolor, drawing or panorama modes.  It's been dropped multiple times and seen it's fair share of water and still works like new.  We've seen other reviews stating that the buttons are stiff and clumsy to push but we didn't have a problem with them.  I would definitely recommend this camera, especially for the price.""
"20110826","1.0","Not Waterproof","I bought this camera for a trip to Holden Beach. Tested the video and pictures at home first and all was good. I kept this camera in my pocket on the beach and got some great pics and video of the kids playing in the water. That lasted two days. On day 3 it started to malfunction and the screen was just glowing - no video or menus. I noticed condensation behind the LCD. Water had seeped behind the LCD screen and the thing died. I was never in the water over my head. I'm 5'10' and only think I'm 10' tall! It was a great concept for 48 hours and I love the pictures and video I got in those 2 days. Luckily I bought it at Sam's days before my trip and had no problem returning. I might buy one again before my next trip - kind of a disposable camera!I was looking at the Fuji just a few minutes ago and seems it gets low ratings and is not waterproof. People with those camera's are reporting that Fuji does not warranty cameras that go under water - hilarious!  Looks like we'll need to wait a couple of years and a few more versions until digital cameras of this type are functional.I'm going back to my 15 year old Canon Sureshot WP-1 35mm. It's the last film camera I own, but has made it through tons of beach, river rafting, camping, etc. trips without a hitch. You can pick one up on e-bay for $32!! Go for it.""
"20110818","4.0","Great Product...so far","This camera is great for the money.  So far I have taken some amazing underwater pictures, which is really what I bought it for, but it happens to do a lot more than I even knew it could.  The panaoramic features and all of the 'magic' features is has are really amazing.  Wish it could take pictures in deeper water, but for the price, I guess its limitations are reasonable.So far everyone who has seen my underwater pics and the camera wants one when I tell them how affordable it is.""
"20110813","5.0","Truly Tough","This'll be my third model and fifth camera of the Stylus Tough series.  Already had this same one for six months, took it too deep skin diving.  NOT a dive camera, but truly tough and weatherproof.  I've lost three cause they go where a camera should not go.  A high end card helps a lot with recycle speed.  I'm trying orange to help with losing it problem.  If you've ever drowned a camera in the rain or ruined one with dirt, think about this one- it's impervious, I would hand it to a three year old in a mud puddle!""
"20110813","1.0","Average Camera that is not EFFICTIVELY waterproof","I bought this camera to record a snorkeling vacation in HI.  I read all the reviews, including the cautions about the need to insure a clean seal, and thought I could be careful enough.  Wrong in spades.The camera worked well enough on land.  I used it several times in both still and video with acceptable, if not great results.  During our first snorkel it worked pretty well.  I got some videos and stills that were serviceable, but again not great.  I did not open the camera until I was back at the condo.  I rinsed and dried it before opening.  Then I cleaned the seal carefully with dry cotton swabs.  I allowed everything to air dry completely while open, then again went over the seal area with a microfiber cloth to remove any lingering debris or dust.  It worked fine.  The next snorkel trip I got three stills and it died.  When I got back there was water inside (salt, of course).  The camera is totally dead.If you want a waterproof, this one WILL die sooner or later, and most likely sooner, especially if you open and close the case during non-water usage.As a camera, the unit is just acceptable.  The color is good but the exposure settings seem off.  You cannot both zoom AND have audio in video mode.  One or the other.  On the good side, I liked the interface.  Easy to understand and change settings.Overall, this is a poor choice for just about any purpose.  The shock resistance feature is about the only reason I can think of to buy it.""
"20110811","2.0","very disappointed","We got this camera before going on vacation.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the pictures.  They came out very grainy and unclear.  A manual did not even come with the camera, everything was downloadable.  What happened to a nice little manual that you can sit and read with the product in hand?""
"20110810","3.0","Had Such High Hopes","I bought this camera for two specific reasons.  First, I have owned an Olympus FE-280 for a long time and taken well over 50,000 pictures with it.  Until recently, I've never had a problem with that camera, and even now it's still excellent 90% of the time.  The FE-280 was left out in the rain once, and washed in the washing machine after being left in a pocket, and both times it came out with no damage.  Second, I took a vacation to Puerto Rico earlier this summer, and knew I'd be taking the camera to the beach, snorkeling and kayaking, etc.  I wanted a camera that would take awesome pics and be able to stand up to some abuse.First, let me say that I love the picture quality and features included with this camera.  The pictures were always sharp, in focus and with excellent color reproduction.  Video and sound quality with this camera were also very good.  The other features, such as photo modes, panoramic, etc are all excellent and easy to use.  I particularly like the super macro mode.  You can get in really close for some very pretty shots.  The advanced adjustment features let you control many aspects of your shooting.  Not as much as a DSLR, but more so than many point and shoot cameras.That said, one of the primary reasons I wanted this camera was for it's waterproofing.  This turned out to be it's only major failure.  There is a door on the side of the camera for access to battery and memory card slots, as well as USB and HDMI ports.  The door has a rubber seal and lock, but it's weak point is the hinge.  This is where the leakage occured in my camera.  It was never much, but in sensitive electronic devices, a drop is all it takes.  About half way through our vacation, my wife and I discovered that water was leaking in.  It would cause the camera to unexpectedly shut off or become completely inoperable.  Salt water also corroded the contacts inside the HDMI port, rendering it unusable.  If we set the camera out and let it dry, it would be fine and continue working after a couple hours.  But who wants to put a vacation on hold to wait for a camera to get working?  Luckily, we also brought the old 280 and my Canon 60D DSLR, so we had plenty of opportunities to take lots of pics.So, if this had been a normal, non-water proof camera, I would rate it 5 stars across the board.  As I mentioned above, picture, video, sound and feature quality are great.  As of right now, we've sent the camera in for warranty service.  We'll see how that works out.  I will post an update later to see how the camera is after that.Thanks for reading.""
"20110802","4.0","Excellent Camera!!!","We bought this as a wedding gift for our best friends. The reason we chose this item was because it was damage resistant and bright to find if set down outside. {The bride lost her first camera, so we needed something to help combat that.}They took it to Cancun and had it in and out of the water for 7 days straight. The camera freezes if it goes past 10 feet, they learned, but if you follow the cleaning instructions, it'll come out unscathed. Which to me, is amazing and totally worth the money!It has several features they've found awesome and helpful, the slideshow when looking for a specific picture, the option to take several pictures at once and have it merged together as one was another.The reason for only 4 stars is the battery life. The camera dies after about 150 pictures, and that is honestly a downer. Especially if you want to take it anywhere that you'll be snapping several pictures...usually vacations.However the quality of the photos, the amazing durability of the camera, and the fun color options, can outweigh the one negative. Just charge it often, or buy a second battery to keep as a backup.I am going to buy one for myself, I'm that sold on it!""
"20110720","3.0","Good deal!","I bought this camera for use outdoors and under rugged conditions.  The camera is light weight and takes excellent sharp photos outdoors.  The zoom feature leaves a little to be desired.  I am having a little bit of a problem taking photos at night where there is a light in the background.  The indoor pictures have bit of noise.  But overall for the price the camera is a good deal.""
"20110719","1.0","Bad Focus","This camera can be good, but the focus doesn't work in closed ambients, I had a bad experience with this camera.""
"20110706","3.0","Wish things could have been different...","Bought this camera to take on a cruise to the Bahamas.  Took a couple of pictures before the trip just to make sure it worked, and all seemed good.The first 5 days of the cruise (including 2 snorkeling expeditions where I didn't get near to 10 feet underwater), it worked great.  Good color rendition, and the panoramic feature was so much more simple than other point-and-shoot digital cameras that I have had.  The pictures were nice, and it worked great under water.  Sadly, towards the end of the 5th day, the view screen stopped working. It would come on for a couple of seconds and then go blank.  I recharged the battery a couple of times, and even tried our spare battery, but that didn't help.The camera didn't leak in the battery compartment, so if it was caused by water leaking in, it came from some other part of the camera.Fortunately, we had our Kodak digital camera with us on the trip, so we were still able to take lots of pictures of the Bahamas and Key West.Sadly, the Olympus went back to the store for a refund.  If it couldn't hold up on a fairly tame cruise, I just couldn't justify getting a new one for potential future vacations like white water rafting that I would want a waterproof, shock-friendly camera for.I have a good Canon DSLR for serious photography.  We bought this camera to take snapshots on the cruise, and for future vacations.  The camera has nice features, and worked great while it worked.  Sadly, since it didn't last 5 full days, I really wouldn't recommend buying one.""
"20110615","4.0","Worked well!","Just got back from a cruise and the cam and video worked well in and out of water. Just wish it had a bit more zoom!""
"20110526","1.0","NOT for watersports","I bought this camera because of the 'water proof' and 'shock proof' claim.  Shock proof I did not verify as we only had it for less than a week.  The water proof claim was found to be false.  Actually, I think that it is water proof but the battery/SD card pocket cover latch is so poorly engineered and constructed that I bumped it open just putting my hand thru the hand strap.I didn't get a chance to mention it to my wife before she took it to the pool with the kid.We have returned the camera to Sam's and are looking for another camera that is truly water proof.  Any suggestions?""
"20110506","4.0","Love it!","I bought this camera after three years of having a cheapy Kodak.  I LOVE the fact that it has the waterproof feature and is shockproof.  Having a waterproof camera when you live in Hawaii is a must.  I took it to the beach and pool the other weekend and got to take pictures of my daughter going down the waterslide.  Love the camera, love the price.""
"20110427","2.0","Not so good","I'm looking for a second camera to take traveling and not my professional camera.  This camera looked so promising, and it was $180 at Sam's Club.  After reading a review that gave this camera a 16/20, I decided to buy for a trip to Niagara Falls next week.  What bells and whistles!  It seemed perfect that this camera is rugged and waterproof.  It looked so good on paper.  I decided not to go with my gut (buy Canon or Sony says my gut).I took the camera back the next morning.  The battery can be put in backwards, which could damage the camera (according to the instructions).  Lame.  The pictures I took had a poor color quality with WAY too much noise for a 14.1MP photo (my old 7.2 Cybershot looks a billion times better). I switched from auto-mode to auto white balance mode and then to sunny setting WB, but it never improved the coolness of the pictures.  The red eye reducer worked well.  The video was not bad at all - 720p works for me.  The USB will charge the camera when plugged in and looked very convenient.  A little too feature rich for me - though it can be lots of fun to play around!I am so disappointed after being completely let down by this camera.  It really looked fantastic.  If the camera were about $100 cheaper, I probably would have kept it for the video or given it to my nephew.""
