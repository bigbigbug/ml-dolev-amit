"20120607","5.0","Super fast card - bonus 1 year recovery SW included","Super fast card. I moved as a test about 45MB of photos to my SSD on my PC in less than 3 seconds.I also couldn't get my camcorder to take photos faster than it could save them on the card. (8.3 MP only for the photos). Previously after a few photos I would have had to wait 20-30 seconds for the photos to go to the card.I also bought a 16GB of the same model and it has worked perfectly.So pick the 45MB/s, class 10, U1 logo (UHS Speed class 1) from a reputable brand like Sandisk, and enjoy super fast transfers.No-brand are available for cheaper, but when it's your vacation, of family photos or video you are recording and you lose a file, the $10 of difference suddenly becomes priceless.Sandisk also gives some code for a 1year recovery software usage. I never used the codes, but it doesn't hurt to keep them around for the day a card will fail (nothing lasts forever: you need to backup your data).Also using a good card reader is needed to get better performance out of the card - something to keep in mind of the PC transfer is slow.Last: this is backward compatible with SD-HC devices. I'm using the 16GB in a Go Pro HD2 and this 32GB in a Sony HDR-CX550V. They might not have the fastest interface for the card, but they get a really nice speed boost to write the files.""

Downloading from the card to my desktop computer (a 2010 HP model) was a breeze. On my first download the pictures were done in less than 45 seconds for a batch of 80 (jpeg + raw, about 1.75GB, and three four minute videos (1.86GB) took around a minute.

I had some issues recording 1080/30fps on my D5100 with previous PNY Professional card.  Several tests with HD video and consecutive still frame bursts never even hiccuped!  I'm 99.4% sure this is going to cure all of the past woes. (The PNY is now relegated to my sweet new Samsung TL500.  No HD video on it, so No worries!)What I wanted to point out to those looking is that this IS the latest 45MB/s SDHC Extreme 16GB card.  AND it's at the same or better price as others selling the previous models!Maybe I'm the only one that's confused about the different versions of the SanDisk SDHC cards.  But I searched and searched trying to make sure I was getting the latest card instead of overpaying for old stock.  I even contacted SanDisk, and their customer support didn't even know that the Extreme is now 45MB/s!  They actually told me that I would have to buy the (now outdated and overpriced) SDSDXP1-016G to get 45MB/s.  I researched this for a couple of evenings, and still knew enough to explain to SanDisk that the SDSDXPA-016G is the new version of what they told me to buy, and it's now 95MB/s for the same price!So here's the breakdown of what I found as of 3/22/12:Lower price Extreme SDHC:SDSDRX3-016G  -  30MB/s  -  OLDSDSDX-016G  -  45MB/s -  CURRENT (Apparently Brand New)Higher price Extreme Pro SDHC:SDSDXP1-016G  -  45MB/s  -  OLDSDSDXPA-016G  -  95MB/s  -  CURRENTThe cards are all about the same price if you buy the same classification and GB size. (A 16GB Extreme is going to be twenty-five to thirty bucks regardless if it's 20MB/s, 30MB/s, or 45MB/s.)I don't know if you really need this Extreme card vs. Ultra or Extreme Pro.  You can determine that...  But don't Overpay for the same performance!  Be sure you Get the Latest Version of whichever you choose.""

"20120307","5.0","The goods","I think everyone knows the Sandisk has earned a reputation as a high-quality flash memory maker. Other manufacturers will often 'stretch' the truth when they rate the read/write speeds. Sandisk typically is conversative when rating the speeds of their cards - you always get at least the advertised read/write speeds, and often more.The card I received was the Class 6 variety. Now here's the interesting thing: I have a Canon Vixia HF100 camcorder that is very finicky about the SD cards it works with. I have tried several other brands (both Class 6 and Class 10), and the Canon always returns with something like 'Can't record in High Quality mode'. Not so with the Sandisk - it works flawlessly. I think Sandisk cards are worth the price premium.""

So because of that it took a lot of time to finish writing on my previous class 2 8gb sandisk. Also there was a point where I thought the camera needed repairing due to the fact that it would stop recording (in hd only) around 2 minutes stating there was not enough space when there was at least 6gb of space available. So I did research on new memory cards hoping that that's what was causing the problem. I was right. I wanted something with space, and something with speed. So I stumbled across the SanDisk Extreme 16 gb. I was looking for higher class memory cards and I found this class 10 which was the highest yet. So at a price that COULD NOT be beat, I bought this one. It was worth every penny. I went to a concert that I wanted to record and this baby came right in time. 7 mins of recording in HD on my previous memory card took a minute and thirty seconds to record. 7 mins of recording in HD on the extreme finished writing in 3 seconds tops. That proves how much of a difference it was. I also noticed the quality was SLIGHTLY higher. I am very glad I bought this memory card.

Contacting SanDisk resulted in a week long exchange of emails in which their customer service reps would repeat the same questions.  After explaining the above situation to them they would respond with 'did you try it in another camera' or 'have you tried our Ultra card'. Some of the questions were not even related to the issue of the card not ejecting.  It appeared that they did not read my explanations.  At the end of the week long exchange they 'passed the buck' and recommended that I return the card for an exchange.

I did several speed read/write test on it and it performed at just its rating as a C6 card (6MB/sec), and just barely faster than my SanDisk C2 cards.If your are being drawn in with its published 'super speeds' and hoping to increase you cameras picture speeds like I was, you may be disapointed like I was.I find that having good high current batteries makes a much bigger difference in camera speeds.I have come to believe that Kingston is a better purchase over any Sandisk product.

After considering a few different cards of this size and class, I decided to with the ol' reliable SanDisk. Initial impressions are positive. The card claims 45MB/s, which I decided to test. Using 233 of 26MB RAW images (about 6GB), I did read/write tests using both FAT32 and NTFS. Read speed on both was good, about 40MB/s average on both file systems. Write speeds were a bit slower, 30MB/s using FAT32 and 25MB/s using NTFS. So what does this mean in the real world? Using my Canon T2i, I was able to shoot 6 shots in RAW mode, before the card would become busy. After that, I could get a shot about every 1-1.5 seconds. It is really up to the individual user to decide whether or not that is acceptable, but for me it's okay. I was able to shoot using the largest JPEG setting continuously, without the card becoming busy. I gave up after 51 shots.

"20120515","5.0","Faster and Cheaper SDHC UHS-1 card","This is my second SanDisk Extreme 32GB SDHC UHS-1 card. First card (SDSDXR3-032G-A21) is the 30MB/Sec card that says HD Video on the label. This new card (SDSDX-032G-X46) is the 45MB/Sec product replacement for this class. Using a card reader that is USB 3.0 and UHS-1 capable, CrystalDiskMark was run for 50MB, 100MB, 500MB, 1000MB, 2000MB, and 4000MB loads. The sequential read and write were very consistent for this card, 45MB/sec and 43MB/sec respectively for reading and writing. Retesting the -A21 card showed consistent rate of 45MB/sec and 34MB/sec for reading and writing. It appears the new and improved SanDisk Extreme card writes about 25% faster.Isn't it all about the writing speed?Class 10 mandates a minimum sustained rate of 10MB/sec read/write speed. UHS is an enhancement to original SD specification in the SDA 3.0 specification for SDHC and SDXC. UHS-1 is also a 10MB/sec minimum sustained specification. UHS is a faster bus for moving data. There is UHS-50 and UHS-104 for 50MB/sec and 104MB/sec, devices are not there yet. UHS-1 is backward compatible with SDHC. Beware of SDXC, if your device does not explicitly support the extended capacity card, this will not work for you.If your camera supports UHS-1 and takes advantage of higher write speed, you can take big pictures and be ready to take another - quicker. 25% quicker than the previous version of Extreme UHS-1 SDHC card from SanDisk. 32GB will store over 4300 pictures for me at highest resolution, or at lowest resolution - over 48,000 pictures.

"20120504","5.0","16GB SanDisk Extreme","I bought this card for use in my GoPro Hero2 HD camera. It works great. Can handle the full HD video as well as the 120fps video. Also works great in burst picture mode. Pop it in my laptop and can quickly transfer the videos.""
"20120503","4.0","Does not work with 2011 MacBook Pro","The card itself is speedy. There is an incompatibility issue with my MacBook Pro. I looked online, and this seems to be an infamous problems that many users face. I am not sure if this is SanDisk's problem or Apple's.""
"20120503","5.0","Great product","Awesome performance on canon ti2 camera.  Normal cards even rated level 8 standard or above would not take  videos.  No problem with this card.  You get what you pay for.""
"20120501","5.0","Got what is on the picture, Not the New 45Mb/s","I do my fair share of reading both on the reviews and product detail before buying anything on Amazon. Both photos show the old 30MB/s read and write. while the spec listed as up to 45MB/s read and write speed. After confirmed it from other reviews that they are receiving the New model with 45MB/s. I decided to order it from (blue proton) which the order is fulfill by Amazon. order on the 4/25/12, go it in the mail 5/01/12. I was disappointed to said it was 30MB/s in the box.So just to warned anyone thinking about getting this item check with the seller to make sure which model you are getting. I left it up to faith and I end up with the older model.""
"20120501","5.0","YES, it is the 45MB/s card, NOT the 30 MB/s card that is pitcured","In case anyone is wondering, I ordered this card and received the 45MB/s card.  I know there is some confusion regarding whether the card is the newer 45MB/s or the older 30MB/s card.  It definitely is the 45MB/s card.  Case closed.""
"20120430","5.0","Amazing Card for Shooting HD video on Canon T2i","This card is great for shooting HD video. I've bought several SD cards in my day and this is by far the best one. It's Better then my Transcend and PNY class 10 cards. If your into shooting HD video on your Canon T2i you can't go wrong with this card. It will not crap out on you while your recording. Where as the Transcend and PNY class 10 cards have crapped out on me several times while I'm in the middle of shooting. I'm actually going to buy more of these cards here soon you will not be disappointed.""
"20120430","5.0","Fast in every regard","This SD card is to replace a previous 32gb Extreme card I've been using in my camera; it got damaged and was no longer readable.  I bought this card because I was totally happy with the previous one, and so far see no decrease in performance.  The last time I bought the card it cost $150 and the price of this time really, really makes me happy.If I had to find something to bitch about it would be that you can store so many files on this that keeping track can become a problem, but it's a problem I can live with.""
"20120429","5.0","Fast and good quality","While a bit more expensive than the standard class 10 cards, it is well worth it. No issues with recording 1080p HD video and the build quality of the card (f one can even comment on such a thing) just seems better than what other manufacturers bring to the table. Granted, I don't know if the card can 'survive' all the items it has listed on the packaging (I have not heard of other cards being affected by airport x-rays) and most of the toughness is marketing, but overall the card is fast and seems very solid. Well worth it.""
"20120428","5.0","Works well with Canon S100","Works without issue on Canon S100 camera.  I am able to take 1080p movies as well as single shots without any lagging problem.""
"20120427","4.0","Can't Go Wrong with a Class 10","A class 10 card does make a big difference to a class 6.  Tried both different classes and did noticed image writing quicker on the class 10.""
"20120427","5.0","Wrong description pic. No issues and fast!","So the picture doesn't match the description. The picture shows a 30MB/s when it's 45MB/s. Anyways, it came as detailed and worked as expected.. .fast and no lag issues.""
"20120427","5.0","Works as expected!","Having this much memory is a pleasure, worry free of running out of space, especially with the more advanced cameras with higher pixel capacity.  But must remember to down load them cuz one wouldn't want an accident of malfunction or losing it with so many stored photos! Promo Price was great, can't find my sale price anymore!! timing was everything!! Highly Satisfied!""

"20120426","5.0","SanDisk Extreme 30 MB/s SDHC Card","This card is very fast and of exceptional quality. With a UHS-compatible device, speeds are as stated. With a non UHS-compatible device, speeds are around 20 MB/s read & write which is still very good.I highly recommend this card over any others of comparable price! You will be very impressed...""
"20120426","3.0","45MB/s or 30MB/s ?","The ad title says that the card is 45MB/s, but the card in the photo shows a 30MB/s card.  Which is correct?""
"20120426","5.0","just as advertised","It's nice when a product performs just as the ads said it would.  This is the case for SanDisk with their Extreme 32GB Flash Card.  No more needs to be said.""
"20120424","5.0","Very good and fast card - 45MB UHS-1","I am using this card in my Nikon D5100.  I took 100 pictures full resolution of continuous shooting without any delay.  it probably filled the buffer, wrote to the card, and continued.  I did not notice any delay.  I stopped the sequence myself.  Very good and fast card.  I ordered from Amazon.  I got he 45MB version and it is UHS-1 card.""
"20120424","5.0","PERFECT unit","High Capacity, High Quality.Sandisk Extreme is known for superior cards, and this surely is one of them.Do NOT go with one of the competitors! Load times and overall reliability of data capture is superior!A++++""
"20120418","5.0","Amazing write speed and storage space, this is a great card!","I have had the chance to use this card a lot over the last six months and have no complaints so far.  I am using a Nikon D7000 camera.  First, the storage space is amazing.  I typically shoot raw images and I can store about 900 images on a single card.  If I shoot .jpg I can store around 16,000 images.  Second, the most important reason I bought this card was for the write speed in shooting images and video.  With other cards I was somewhat limited when I was taking rapid photos in either single or burst mode.  I was limited in the write speed and would often have to wait for the images to save before shooting more.  With this card there is no waiting.  I am able to capture the images at any speed I would like.  This comes in handy when shooting action shots like wildlife or children (same difference ;).  The write speed also allows me to capture full 1080p high quality video.  Personally, I think this card is a great deal at the price.  I plan on purchasing a second card for my other card slot in my camera for my upcomming trip to Spain.  That way I don't have to worry about lugging a device to offload the images.""
"20120416","5.0","Very Good!","I use a gopro HD Hero and when I was shooting high speed video with my old card (class 4) I would get a lot of lag in the video because the card could not keep up especially at 60 frames per second. With this sd card I have no lag at all. Very Satisfied!""
"20120416","5.0","Great speed","I was amazed at how much better this class 10 memory card is than the old class 4s I had been using. Excellent -- working better than expected.""
"20120416","4.0","Very Fast and Durable","Having previously owned a SanDisk 'Ultra' I knew that the extreme would probably be a nice one as well. I love the extra space and the speed. It's quite fast, allowing me to take a long exposure and record it to the card in less than half the time of the shutter speed. For example, with my old card, if I took a thirty second exposure, it would take another thirty seconds to process the photo. Now it is all written in ten seconds. A couple weeks of use, and so far I am very satisfied! Nice work, SanDisk!""
"20120413","5.0","Faster in my T3i","I just got the 16GB card with the 45MB rating and I did a quick test in my T3i and was very pleased.  I was hoping for faster response for action shots so I did a test using a 5 second burst of shots.  With the card I've been using (a PNY class 10, 16GB card) I was getting a consistent 13 shots and it was definitely slowing down on the last few.  With the Sandisk Extreme I was consistently getting 19 shots with no sign of slowing down.Very happy with my purchase although SanDisk does kind of overdo the packaging, perhaps to make the card look like it's worth the price premium for those shopping in a B&M store.""
"20120412","5.0","Works great!","I bought this card from a competing website, to use with my Canon T2i. The card itself works fine although I don't really see a difference in speed between this card and my Sandisk Ultra. I'm assuming this is a problem with the camera not being able to make use of the increased write speed. I used both cards to take pics in 'Raw + JPEG' on Continuous mode. For both cards, the camera hesitated after taking 4 pics. After like 6 pictures taken continuously, the camera would show a 'Busy' while it wrote all pics from the camera buffer to the memory card. I expected that the camera would take less time here, on the Extreme than the Ultra but it didn't work that way. Both times, it took like 3 seconds for me to get control of my camera again.I'm sure this review is not helpful to most people but if you have a T2i and are looking for a memory card, this one seems like overkill.I will update later if I notice any changes.""
"20120411","5.0","Excellent","Although I have not used this card for actual Video, I use it in my Canon T3i for capturing Hi res JPEG and RAW shots at 18mp. This results in around 25-29 Megabytes a shot. It has worked flawlessly with no delays in normal shooting. I have not tried anything faster than approximately 1 shot every 3-4 seconds at the fastest.""
"20120410","5.0","fast but better yet, micro is universal with tabs","Excellent for fast frame shotting. fast reading too. you might consider micro because it workes better for family viewing on the tabs.""
"20120408","5.0","Powerful speed","this SD card is a excelent choice for HDSLR entusiasts and video pros, the speed of recording in full hd is amazing.""
