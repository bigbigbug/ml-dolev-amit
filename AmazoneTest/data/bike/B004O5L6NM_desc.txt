NEW Motorcross Dirt Bike Helmet Action Cam Video DVR
Designed with the adventurer in mind, the SportCam is ideal for when your hands are simply too busy to bother with holding a camera. Whether you're climbing the north face of Eiger in the Bernese Alps, shredding black diamond runs at A-Basin in Colorado or tearing up the Slickrock Trail in Moab on your mountain bike, the SportCam will capture all the action, including whatever candid commentary you make along the way.   <table cellspacing="10" ><tr><td width="400" height="400" background="http://bit.ly/pVM2Cw"> </td><td width="50">  </td> <td width="400" height="400" background="http://bit.ly/rh8PNC"> </td><tr><td width="400">  <b>Swivel Mount</b><br> Once the SportCam is snapped in place on the grip strap mount, you can orient it in any direction.
