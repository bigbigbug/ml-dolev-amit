With amazing clarity, stability, and slow-motion capabilities, these cameras record your sport's most exciting moments in professional quality HD video and automatically-captured 5 megapixel still photos. HD HERO products can shoot video or photos from your point-of-view, mounted on your helmet, body, car, motorcycle, surfboard, or other equipment. And GoPro's 170° wide-angle lens (the industry's widest) even lets you take shots of yourself during your activity. All captured hands-free, while you stay focused on your activity.<br><br>The HD HERO line produces higher quality HD video than action sports cameras costing ten times as much, and as a result many video segments you see in action sports film and TV today are shot on GoPro cameras.<br><br><b>Includes</b><br>
