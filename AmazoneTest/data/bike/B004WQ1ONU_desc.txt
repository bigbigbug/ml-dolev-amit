Day 6 Plotwatcher Pro HD Game Surveillance System
Harness the power of time lapse! Day 6 Outdoors PlotWatcher Pro Trail Cam delivers a full day's worth of scouting info in mere moments, in HD clarity! Where other game cams are triggered by a remote sensor, the PlotWatcher Pro snaps pics at regular intervals... as many as one every 5 seconds... capturing ALL the action from dusk to dawn, and presents them into a 10-minute HD time-lapse video. You'll watch a whole day's worth of scouting in mere minutes! And while other cameras only take pics of game in the foreground, the PlotWatcher Pro catches game no matter how near or far, from 30 feet to 300, so you see exactly where your buck is moving, even if he isn't coming near the camera. It's almost as good as spending a full day scouting the area yourself... and a whole lot more convenient! And with up to 4X longer battery life than the original PlotWatcher, you can count on up to a full month of time-lapse coverage on a single set of batteries! For serious scouting, the choice is clear... check out the details: 1280 x 720 high-definition video for outstanding clarity; Battery life lasts up to an astounding one million video images (equals 28 days of 10 second interval time-lapse); Built-in 2 1/2" LCD viewing screen for easy on-board set-up and video aiming; Review one full day in 10 minutes or less, or scroll through images frame by frame; Time-lapse settings for 5 or 10 seconds, or customized intervals; Customizable recording time, from one second to 60 minutes; Simple and easy-to-use thumb wheel control; 32 GB USB drive recommended (not included); Security cable-ready (not included); Accepts add-on zoom lens; GameFinder Software with MotionSearch software included; Uses 8 AA batteries (not included).
