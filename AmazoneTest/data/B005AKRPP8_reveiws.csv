"20120601","5.0","Excellent product for the price !","This camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures. If a data card was included with it, that would put this product over the top.""
"20120529","5.0","Easy to use product","The category point-and-shot really describes this product. Great pictures and fast shutter, even with targets in movement. I'm pleased with the price-result ratio. The size is very confortable.""
"20120517","1.0","Terrible Camera","Has difficulty taking pictures in natural light.  Sunny day?  Well, it's a bad day for photos with this one.  My particular model became unusable with a faulty LCD after only four months of use, but you might have better luck.""
"20120517","3.0","Kodak Easy share","I love this camera, it was well worth the money. The only thing I would change about it is that the battery could be rechargeable and it could have a better view when you zoom in.""
"20120516","5.0","Pleased with purchasse","We have another Easyshare camera which influenced my purchase - I like the picture quality. Pleased with the purchase, and it's receipt.""
"20120514","5.0","Kodak is back","This little Easyshare camera was not only a great buy, but it is a gem of a little digital camera that offers a ton of features. And, as the name implies it is very easy to share the pictures and videos. Another top value and speedy order processed by Amazon!!""
"20120507","3.0","Not the best...","It's a good camera for beginners.  The face recognition slows things down a bit and it's not a camera that you can take one picture quickly after another.  The social page share feature is cool, but that's easy to do with other cameras as well.  For an extra camera - this fits the bill, but if you want to take pics faster - go with Canon or Nokia.""
"20120504","5.0","got it for a party","Bought this specifically to use at a bday party in a nite club. Even in the dark it worked great! Plus its light  weight & small enuff to tuck in a prty sized handbag :-) You def have to buy  an sd card for use from the start. But i'd learned that from another reviewer.""

"20120427","3.0","It is ok","I bought this camera to replace my Kodak easy Share C513 camera. I have to say I liked my old one a lot better. It will work for now one of my complaints about this camera is when you take video it is really dark you have to have a lot of light behind whatever you are recording and the pictures are not the greatest either. I will be buying a different camera for sure. Hope this review was helpful.""
"20120420","3.0","not a great camera","I used this camera once and never could take a clear picture. It is not my camera, but you would be shocked at the picture's poorness.""
"20120416","4.0","Good secondary digital camera","We have 3 digital cameras in our household and this one is excellent for the price. No, it's not the best digital camera, but nobody should expect to get the best digital camera and pay only $58 for it. It's great for what it does.""
"20120409","1.0","Horrible pictures","I gave this camera to my mom for Christmas. I've used it as much as she has and I've been the one to transfer the pictures off the camera to the computer. She hates this camera and I've got to agree with her. The 'easy share' is not so easy but she isn't that concerned with that. It's the quality of the pictures that is so horrible. They are so foggy. It looks like there is some type of film over the lens but I've cleaned it several times and it is still there. See the images I added to see what I'm talking about. Don't waste your money on this camera.""
"20120320","5.0","Works Great.","This was a great purchase by all means and the price was just right ,I am taking pictures again and again the quality is excellent also the camera is a great help in that it automatically focuses on the face of the people or the objects, it also make the normal item look even better than it looks with the normal eyes.Operation very simple so that it make you feel not to put it down,to me this was a BEST buy.""

"20120210","1.0","No ability to manually focus.","This is a toy.  No ability to control focus, which I consider to be a pretty basic feature as most cell phone cameras even have this.  Don't expect to take a photo of anything closer than a yard.  Camera on my iphone  blows this thing away!""
"20120208","5.0","Cute Cam!","I know you men out there may not define a camera as 'cute' but, that's what comes to mind when I see it. It wokrs well; takes great quality pics and has other great specs about it for not being a high end rated camera. Its definitly a great buy.""

"20120122","5.0","great camera","This is a camera that takes good pictures with items that need detail. The size makes it easy to store and carry. Over all this is a good product.""
"20120118","4.0","After Initial Shock - Camera is really good","Here's the thing - this camera does NOT COME with a memory card.  So when you pull it out of the package - there are 2 batteries and you can take 1 (YES - ONE) picture.  For novices - this means you must also buy an SD card - which granted is about $1 / per 1 GB (I bought an 8GB card here on Amazon).  I think this is because 'memory size' is a personal choice and since it effects overall price I sort of understand why the camera comes without... But my point is that it doesn't exactly 'work' out of the box.  However, the camera, once I got a SD card, works really well.  My 5 year old is the primary user - it seems to take great pictures for her - very easily.  And the 5x zoom is great for really close up stuff that kids like.  So overall, good camera, but you need 2 purchases - the camera and an SD card.""
"20120117","2.0","eh","Terrible camera. I have had several kodaks and loved them. This one takes horrible pics inside. I know most dig cams work better in natural light, but this one is terrible. I wouldn't recommend it.""
"20120105","3.0","kodak c1505","i think the camera is simple and just ok for the right price..i like the color since its so cute,but im wondering if I take a shot or picture it click two times or made a sound twice..I dont know if theres something wrong with it or its really like this.But for overall I think theres no problem..""

"20111228","5.0","Came in time for Christmas!!","I bought this item to give as a gift for Christmas.  It was shipped and delivered in less than a week, which was fantastic not worrying whether it would get here in time.  It was a great price and I am very happy with the quality of the pictures.  It has a slight delay from the moment you click the top and it takes the picture but it's still better than some cameras I've had.  This is a great starter camera, particularly for a teenager which is the one that received it.""
"20111219","4.0","Kodak EasyShare C1505 12 MP Digital Camera","The camera is fine BUT IT DID NOT come with a storage memory card (MB card?) so I had to buy one at WalMart before I could give the camera as a gift.  Without the memory card, it was incomplete and I was disappointed that this wasn't made clear when I ordered.""
