"20120612","5.0","Replacement for an 8 year old camera!","It became time to replace our wonderful, old Casio camera that we loved. We wanted to replace it before it broke.We researched similar cameras and found the Nikon. We have just started using it but so far the pictures are excellent. Easy to use, much like the old camera, and we love how you get the close up feature! Took photos of the grandsons learning to water ski and am amazed at the excellent photos we got! Much sharper and closer than our old camera.I took some photos of raptors at a demonstration today and they turned out exceptionally good. So we look forward to many trips with the new camera taking both scenic as well as family photos.""
"20120612","5.0","Nice Camera","Really like this camera.  Its solid and takes great pictures.  The optical zoom is fantastic for such a small camera.  I would recommend an extra battery for it as I only get 2-3 hours of solid use of the one.  I bought this nice set http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VRQNS6/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 which I couldn't beat for 20 bucks.""
"20120612","4.0","Nice camera.","Still learning all this camera does,but very happy with it so far.Wanted small, yet powerful. The 10 x's optical zoom is great.""
"20120608","2.0","BLAH","Going by all the 5 star reviews I expected more... this camera is nothing special, you could get an $70 camera and it would take the same quality pics... HD?!! where? the pics are ok and the video, one word comes to mind LAME... you zoom it blurs and does not auto focus at all, pixelated like crazy, dont even think of using it in lowlight or indoors, I have a webcam and the 'HD' is 1000x betterthis is a CHEAP back up DAYTIME OUTDOOR camera only, nothing more, dont think I would buy a Nikon ever again after this""
"20120606","4.0","Great camera","I bought this camera to give as a present and after seeing all the features and the quality of the photos, I purchased one for myself. You get really good photos and quality videos. A great camera for the money.""
"20120605","4.0","Great cam for the price","Nice camera and features. Very easy to use with vivid pics. Love everything except for the color which isn't really blue but more purplish.""
"20120605","5.0","Awesome","Best bang for the buck camera! Not big money but big value. Specifically great zoom, good pic save speeds vs my old camera, and panoramic photos""
"20120604","4.0","Happy with it","Good solid camera that feels comfortable in the hand and pocket. Outdoor photos on a bright day are very sharp. Colors are accurate. Indoor handheld photos are better than those with my previous camera, a Canon sd1100. Taking videos is simple with good focus while zooming and panning. My only peeve is that the sound of the zoom motor is very easily picked up by the microphone while taking videos which makes me not want to use the zoom at all while shooting people. Overall, a good camera at a reasonable price.""
"20120602","5.0","Love it","I love this camera; it's compact and easy to use; great value for the money! Would defo recommend this and purchase this item again!""
"20120529","4.0","Good Value","This is a good product at a reasonable price.  I shoot with a SLR but take this one on trips when space is limited and it functions nicely.""
"20120529","4.0","Highly recommended","I took it to the golf course and took the video of swings.  Looked great on my HD TV screen.  Panorama view picture worked great too.  Strongly recommend to buy.  Reason for giving only four is that it goes sometimes blurry with auto focus mode.""
"20120529","5.0","worth every penny","I splurged on this camera before a cruise last month and I'm SO HAPPY I did.  I mainly was drawn in by the CMOS sensor and the speed of the camera - have 2 children...  And it did not disappoint.  This is the first point and shoot since my old old 4300 that I have been happy with.  I have had Nikons for a long time and this is prob my 5th or 6th p&s from them.  I have a habit of dropping them in toilets...  running them over in my van... :)  So I have been SUPER careful with this one cuz I LOVE it.  The quality is great, the features are great - really like the panorama mode.  I had a lot of fun with this camera.  I highly recommend it.""
"20120528","1.0","Do Not Buy Coolpix","I am sad to say that I have wasted a huge sum of money on this camera. The camera is very small and very cheaply made with a plastic feel to it. The absolute worst is that it is not compatible with MacIntosh computers or iPhoto. You have to waste a half an hour downloading a special Nikon software, and even then it will not recognize a connection with a USB cable!! In fact, it's even stated in the user's manual: 'Connecting The USB Cable: The connection may not be recognized if the camera is connected to the computer via a USB hub.' WHAT?! Isn't that the primary purpose of a digital camera - to be able to connect it to a computer and simply upload the photos?Please be warned: THIS CAMERA IS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. Run don't walk away from Coolpix. If you look online, people have written about all sorts of models numbers under this brand and they all have trouble simply uploading photos. Ridiculous.Another negative is that the Nikon 'help line' has a constant busy signal. A help line with a busy signal? Really? If I could give minus stars on this product, I would.""
"20120527","5.0","Great camera","I really do like this camera, it is allot better than my older Olympus. It's zoom is quite better than my older camera. The only fault is I'm not real happy with the smaller window on the viewfinder, I was happier with the 3 inch screen. I would highly recommend this camera in its price range. It shoots very good pictures and video playback is amazing.""
"20120526","4.0","No complaints so far","Bought this item for my wife who loves to take pictures, but she seems unimpressed.  Have to chalk that up to the fact that it is still a new camera to her.  Believe she will appreciate it more as you uses it more and experiences the results.""
"20120525","5.0","Nikon S6300","Great camera!! Was shipped super fast and when it came it didn't disappoint me. Takes AMAZING pictures with great detail. Easily the best camera I have ever owned and I have had quite a few. I would deffinently recommend it to anyone and the price was not bad at all! Five Stars!!!""
"20120523","3.0","Does not take HD High Quality Pics...","Camera is cheap...it feels cheap when you hold it.  Pics don't turn out all that 'HD High Quality.'  They turn out....ok.  HD movie mode does allow you to zoom while recording, and the 10x optical zoom is very powerful.  But if you're looking to take high resolution pics....this camera DOES NOT TAKE HIGH RESOLUTION HD PICS....I think I'm going to return it.""
"20120523","2.0","Frrrrrragile!!","The very first day after I bought the camera it announced 'LENSE ERROR', and never worked again. So back to the dealer, as Nikon proposes a 7 day exchange warranty. The dealer refused to comply. So the the Nikon service center, who did not succeed to convince the dealer either. So the service denter exchanged the camera, unfortunately only black available. This is 2 weeks ago. I treat the camera as if it were made of crystal,it just does not feel solid. As for the pictures, ok in good conditions, no more. Definitely poor in SPORTS scene and low light.""
"20120522","3.0","Nikon CoolPIX S6300","Received this camera from Amazon and it was just great...until I played back the 1080 HD video and noticed some white spots on the image.  I called Amazon and promptly got through to a person who gave me a tech support number for Nikon.  Nikon told me to try playing it back on another screen and if I got the same result it was a problem with the camera.  So I quickly got another call through to Amazon and they immediately sent a replacement camera, expedited the shipping at no charge and I will have a new camera in 2 days.  So I will update this review when I get the new camera.  Has anyone else had a similar problem with Nikon sensors?  This camera was made in China.I really like the fact that it has full HD, and it contains a mini-HD outlet on the camera.  The stereo sound is great on it, too.""
"20120518","1.0","zooming in and out while recording produces blurred video","I got this camera less than two weeks ago right before Mother's Day, and I have used it to video record two indoor events the past two evenings.  Both times the video is out of focus when zooming in and out even though I set it to Full Time AF in video recording settings.  Let say I zoomed to position 5 and the video was perfectly focused.  I then zoomed in to position 4, but now it was out of focus.  When I zoomed in more to position 3, it was focused again.  If I zoomed out to position 6, it was out of focus.  If I zoomed out more to position 7, it was then clear again.  There is something not working with the focusing mechanism of this camera.Besides focusing, the camera can't operate while it's charging.  You can't watch the recorded video or pictures while it's charging.  My older Canon can do that, and that model was 2+ years old.  I am returning this camera.""
"20120517","4.0","Great Camera/Easy to use","I bought this camera about 2 weeks before my brothers destination wedding. I had looked at numerous cameras before I chose this one.  I wanted with 10x zoom on it.  I like this camera a lot, and it was very easy to use, considering I was not able to test it out before I left on my trip.  I broght the manual with me, just in case I needed to know how do do something, and I never opened it once.  The only con I would give the camera (and I am still not sure if its a con) because I need to use it more, is the battery life.  My battery died during my brother's wedding ceremony, when I needed it the most, and I had to run back to my room to charge the battery.  That might be also because it was the first time I has used the camera on that battery charge.  But that was my only downfall on this camera. I might update this in a few weeks after I use my camera more.""
"20120514","4.0","Its, Not What I Expected Really","I bought this because a lot of people wrote a review on this and they were all 5 stars. I really like it. But except the face that it is really thick and the screen where you see the photos is small. The quality and pictures are every detailed. I really like this but its too thick for me and the screen is too small for me. I would like it better with a wider screen and if it was thinner. Its light though.""
"20120509","3.0","simple camera","I thought since this was a 2012 model that it would have a lot of features and would be modern but no this seems like a simple camera i would expect from years ago. I do not like the buttons or the screen it seems like a basic junk camera, i dont like that its not a touchscreen. The  pictures were clear at first then the color just don't look right, whenever i take a pic it looks foggy and dim not at all what i expected for a 2012 model maybe for  2002 it looks modern but the functions are old seems like a junky camera.UPDATE: This camera took horible pictures outside, they were super dark. i could not get the lighting good on the pictures, but you just have to keep playing with the settings to get it right, also the delete all option is so easy to hit by mistake it deleted all my pictures that i could not get back i dont like that at all. but after i played with the settings i found it does take some pretty good pictures with alot of detail.""
"20120507","5.0","CoolPix","Excellent product. The quality of the video is awesome, specially the stabilization control. The picture quality for the 16 pixels is supreme. The camera works pretty fast too. No long waiting between pics.""
"20120502","5.0","Great camera","I bought this camera for my trip to the UK and let me just say it was a great choice. I've only purchased Sony cameras so I was hesitant to switch to another brand but I'm glad I did. The photos turned out wonderful, colors were vibrant and details were excellent. The zoom is great and pictures still turn out awesome even zoomed in all the way. The only issue I have with the camera is that it lags and takes few seconds to record the picture. Overall, I am happy that I decided to make the switch and I highly recommend this camera.""
"20120502","5.0","Excellent camera with tons of features","The quality of the photos is amazing.  The flash does a great job of taking quality images in low-light, so well that the image looks completely natural.  The camera can take consecutive photos relatively quickly and the battery lasts for hundreds of photos.The camera is a perfect size, is very portable, and takes amazing pictures (they also look very sharp when printed).  The zoom is good and the image stabilization feature is excellent.  Nikon truly makes great lenses and digital cameras, and you can't go wrong with the Coolpix S6300.""
"20120426","5.0","Great Camera","It has a Gazillion features now all I have to do is become tech Savvy. I still love it though.""
"20120410","5.0","Pat","This camera is wonderful. It is simple to use, takes great pictures and is very compact. The zoom lense is easy to use and close up pictures are very clear. When the pictures are printed they are sharp and crisp. I would buy this camera again!""
"20120327","5.0","Camera","Wonderful item. Worth the wait (pre-release purchase) and so worth the money!  The size and shape make it easy to hold, and it has many features that I am still learning how to use.""
"20120319","5.0","Great camera that does really take better than average pictures!","I am and always have been skeptical of buying digital cameras. This is the cheapest entry and also one of the newest from Nikon that has a CMOS sensor rather than a CCD sensor. Let the argument go on who is better. When the lighting is sun light, the Nikon shines and creates wonderful photos. Low light, of course, is a typical offender of ruining a good picture. If the flash is used, most of the time it does a good job to make everything look natural and not 'over-toned' in anyway or display odd contrast properties.I think this is a great product and really sells itself when you view the information offered on Nikons web site.5/14/2012 UPDATE : The flash stopped firing. I went through the reference manual and played out all scenarios in which the Flash should fire and it is not. The flash has been deemed defective my Nikon and I have been granted a return authorization. This is upsetting but I hope Nikon can give a quick turn around with my camera or just give me a new unit all together. I really do enjoy the camera when it works!""
