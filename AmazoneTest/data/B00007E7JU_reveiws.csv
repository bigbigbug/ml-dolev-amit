"20120612","5.0","Great lens, Great price","This was my first lens to buy for my first camera (Canon 60D). I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good overall lens AND a fabulous price. This is Canon's cheapest lens, but don't let that scare you from getting it!Since it has a 1.8 aperture, it handles low light or night photography VERY well.The only thing I have against it is the construction of it. It does seem a little cheaply made, but I think the great quality of the images and the awesome price overrides this fact. Simply put, don't ever, ever drop your camera. This was my second time to buy this lens because I broke my first one by dropping my camera.Once again, I highly recommend this lens!!""

"20120604","3.0","You DO get what you pay for","Bought this lens after reading 'you get what you pay for' several times in the reviews.  I thought, 'What the heck,  I'll try it.  It's only 119.00.  I'm a  beginner and shouldn't invest too much money in equipment quite yet.'  Well, it is a great little lens for the money and it is made of plastic.  I used it quite often and as a beginner I thought the pictures where  pretty good  - judging from my beginner eye and was told by experienced photographers that is was a good little lens for the money. Back to my first thought...you get what you pay for.  After shooting with it, I bumped the hood of the lens (not that hard) and it collapsed into itself and when I took it off the camera it broke in two. I did use this lens for hundreds of pictures and if I hadn't broken it I guess  I would still be happy with it.  Would I buy it again?  No.  I gave it three stars because it did work and took pretty good pictures and suited its purpose while I was learning. Next similar lens will be better made with better reviews. I will research a little further before purchasing another similar lens.""

It's super tiny, but I have small hands so focusing isn't a problem. When it's at 1.8 you have a tiny range in focus, so it makes sharp pictures a little harder to get, set it at 2.0 and you're muuuuch better off. And shooting in low light, it's a dream!!!The other thing I loved was the super fast shipping. The projected date was twelve to eighteen days off and I got it in three!!""

I am extremely happy with this product and highly recommend it.""
"20120315","5.0","Great","This is a great buy. I've been looking for an affordable lens that can take pictures in low-light areas. My other lens only went to 3.5, so buying a 1.8 has made a world of difference!""
"20120314","5.0","Should be your first purchase!","Now, consider first the price: I paid about $100 for mine, with the going rate right now at about $120. This is not a professional lens, by any stretch... but it is one of the best lenses you can purchase as a beginning photographer!I have had this lens for about 4-5 months right now, and it has barely been off my camera! The aperture allows for very low-light photography, and the glass is good quality for the price you pay.The lens construction is plastic, but unless you are particularly rough on your equipment, you shouldn't have a problem. The focusing ring is small, but I rarely use manual focus because most of my photos are of action shots.Speaking of action shots, that's where this lens shines. I take photos of one of the local show choirs pretty often, and the environment in their shows isn't exactly conducive to photography. Lighting is very variable; sometimes the light is good, but other times there's a spotlight on one or two people with limited light on the rest. That makes for some demanding choices- do you go with a high ISO and/or aperture and try to get a good shot of everyone, or do you just try to get the people in the spotlight? With this lens, you can open up the aperture much wider than a kit lens, which means that you don't have to raise the ISO. That's good if you want to reduce noise in the photos. I can shoot 800 or 1600 ISO with a wide aperture and still stop the motion of the dancers.There are a few weaknesses, though. This is a prime lens- no variable zoom, which means that your zoom is all leg-zoom. I've gotten very good at moving around for my photography because of this, so unless you simply cannot move, this isn't really a weakness. The lens does sometimes focus slowly, and with a narrow manual focus ring it isn't easy to keep focused. It also isn't great for macro shots- the minimum focus distance is somewhere around 1.5 feet, so the kit lens is better in that one circumstance.Pros:InexpensiveHigh quality for the priceLarge apertureLightweightCons:Plastic construction (lightens the lens, but less durability)No zoom (not a Con for me, but for some it might be)Small focus ringSometimes slow to focusLong minimum focus length""

"20120312","5.0","The "must have" lens for parents","This was my second lens (after the 18-55 that came with my Canon t2i) and I've been using it for a few weeks now.  I'm very happy with the lens and the pictures I've taken with it.  Most of my shots are of my 2 year old daughter running around and the kind of shots this lens lets you take is simply amazing.  This lens lets in significantly more light than the 18-55 kit lens when set at 50mm (around 8x more), which lets your camera pick lower ISO values and/or much faster shutter times without having to resort to using the flash.  The downside of using the lens wide open is that the shots end up slightly 'soft', which, depending on the situation, isn't entirely a bad thing as it gives the photo a slightly dreamy feel.  You can of course reduce the aperture a bit to sharpen up the focus and still end up with a significant light advantage over the kit lens.Alot has been said about the build quality of the lens but to me it doesn't feel remarkably different from the 18-55 kit lens or the 55-250 I picked up recently. This is one factor that definitely depends on your frame of reference.  If you're just starting out like me and staying on the cheaper side of Canon's lens lineup, this lens will feel right at home.The major con of this lens is that after using it for a few weeks and seeing the kind of flexibility it gives you, the idea of spending many hundreds of dollars each on Canon's other 'fast' lens will suddenly start to make sense.""
"20091212","2.0","Avoid this lens, flat in color, hurrible AF.","Good lens are expensive and when people find a nice piece of glass for cheap the buzz goes around. Many time that buzz is spread by people who have never owned or used the lens. It becomes automatic assumption that because it is a 50mm prime, it should be great. Don't believe the hype.The first buzz about this lens is its advantage to the Nikon equivalent because this lens will AF with all the Canon Rebels DSLR. Just be ware that the AF on this lens is horribly inaccurate so you will end up having to manual focus anyways, and that is a pain because of the design of the AF ring.The second buzz about this lens is that it is great for low light photography because its f1.8 max aperture. Just be aware that this lens is useless at f1.8, it is soft and flat in color, and I mean it.  This lens becomes useful only after f2.8 so the whole low light advantage is only a myth.To be honest, I have gotten better and sharper results from the camera kit lens and for that I would caution you to spend your money wisely on a different lens.""

"20091209","4.0","Cheap lens that delivers high quality photos","This lens is exactly as most reviewers describe it...it is very cheaply constructed, but the glass is good giving excellent images so as long as you're not subjecting it to abuse or bad weather you should be fine. For the money, this is the best deal you are going to find on a lens that is excellent for portraits and low-light shots.I bought this for portrait shots using my Canon Rebel XSi and it is absolutely awesome in this capacity. On a cropped-frame Digital SLR like mine it views at 80mm so if you are going to use it to shoot portraits just make sure you have at least 5 ft from camera to subject (for head/shoulder shots) and another 4-5 feet from subject to background/backdrop.I also noticed that at its widest (f/1.8) the center is tack sharp but the edges are a bit soft, which is not neccesarily a bad thing if you want/like that look. If you want sharp edges you would just need to stop down a couple steps to say f/4 (aka 'the sweet spot').I also shot some outside images of flowers and such and did notice that the bokeh can be a bit sloppy, especially in 'busy' backgrounds (pentagon-shaped blades to blame here) so you would probably NOT want to buy this lens if your main purpose was to capture nice background blur. You would probably want to spend the extra money and get the 50mm f/1.4 lens.That's why I think this lens is primarily suitable for PORTRAIT SHOTS where the background is typically a nice muslin/vinyl backdrop where the bokeh really wouldn't be distracting. People have told me that the portrait shots I took with white/black backdrops looked very professional.""

"20091208","4.0","Cool Lens To Play With","I've had this lens for just under a year and it has been really fun to play with.  It allows you to open up the aperture very wide and shoot in very low light situations.  You will also be able to create a very shallow depth of field in any situation by opening up the aperture so wide.  For a lens that is under $100 dollars it gives you the most fun for your $.  However if you're looking for superior image quality: sharpness and clarity then this lens is not for you.  If you are just learning and playing around with low light photography and shallow depth of field it is perfect.  Other than that you need to invest in something much more expensive to get something that will not have soft focus or ghosting effects.""

I use this lens on a Canon 40D, and with an ISO setting at 800, this lens does exactly what I want it to do.

I highly recommend this lens. It's an incredible bargain.""
"20091201","5.0","Fast lens for low light, great for portraits too.  Explanation of what the 1.8 means to novice users..","Most people don't know this:  for every interval you go up on your aperture (f-stop: like  1.4  2.0  2.8  4  5.6  8  11  16  22  which you can find on your camera lens) then your camera requires TWICE AS MUCH light to make the picture.In reverse, when you go DOWN a full stop (from 2.8 to 2.0 for example), your camera needs HALF AS MUCH light to take the photo.Most off the shelf consumer cameras have a lowest setting of 4 or so.  What that means is that THIS lens (at f1/8) requires LESS THAN ONE QUARTER of the light that your stock lens requires to take the same shot!  So... you'll be able to take shots in darker circumstances, and you'll be able to avoid using the flash (which often makes photos look terrible.)The other advantage this lens has is with depth of field.  You know those shots in fancy magazines where only a part of the image is in focus, and the rest is blurry?  This lens makes it so you can take those shots too.  You'll feel like a fancy photographer, I promise.And man is it cheap. And light.  You'll be glad to have this lens in your bag or on your camera.""
"20091201","5.0","Amazing","Just about everything I've read about this lens mentions all of the good reasons to buy it so I will leave those out assuming this is not the first review you will be reading. My review is based on what Canon intended for this lens to be, which was a quality lens at a ridiculously affordable price, and not a comparison to a very similar, more expensive and slightly better version of itself(50mm 1.4).A lot of reviews I read mentioned the same 'faults' and I find none of them as severe as they are made out to be. This lens is so cheap because corners were cut to deliver L lens quality in a $100 lens.1. Build- Yes its cheap and plastic. Most of the reviews that state this lens broke also mention dropping them or mistreating them in some way. If you take care of it I can easily see it lasting years.2. 1.6 crop factor on certain bodies= medium telephoto- I find this very useable indoors and prefer this over a true 50mm. I honestly can't see this being an issue.3. Loud autofocus- I haven't had any problems with this either. I also don't shoot small insects or anything with this lens that could get scared away.4. Slow autofocus- In low light it can be a little slow, but again not a big issue. I haven't missed a photo op yet.This lens may be the best value out there, but it still measures up with some of the best without factoring in price.Amazing, buy it immediately.P.S.I bout a collapsable lens hood to protect this for $6 that works just as well as Canon's $25 hood.""

Personally, id buy a lens with a bit better build quality instead, but if you are on a budget then you certainly cant go wrong with this lens.

"20091111","3.0","Good value, until it breaks, then more good value after repairing it","I bought this at a shop when I was on vacation in New Orleans.  The 18-55 lens that shipped with my XSi could not handle certain shots without a flash.  Well, that location was the aquarium.  Even with a diffuser, and bouncing the flash I would get a reflection of the flash in some glass.  With more sight seeing, I had enough of that.  So I tried the 50mm f/1.8 against the kit lens.  In the shop the same exposure required 1/8s with the 18-55 (f/5.6 at 55mm) and 1/125s with this lens.  I didn't try my 55-250 EFS at an equivalent 80mm, but that would be just over f/4.  Better than the 18-55, but nowhere near f/1.8. Additionally, the depth of field on this lens is tiny compared with such a large aperture - great for portraits. I took some great shots at Pat O'brien's in late afternoon in October with no flash.The next day was not so good.  The lens fell out of my bag at the Audubon park, and it broke into 2 pieces.  Luckily the optics were intact.  The ribbon cable for the electronics however, was severed.  I had a paperweight, temporarily.  Due to it's poor construction is was just as easy to put back together and rip apart again.  I replaced the ribbon cable with 7 separate wires (soldered them on) and viola, a working lens again, sort of.  I had to melt a  part on the AF drive to get the counter working again as well.  Without that the focus just hunts.  After a couple attempts, I got it mostly working - sometimes in manual focusing mode it still runs the motor for several seconds.  But some issues are to be expected with a quick on-vacation repair ($10 soldering iron from Walmart and some wires from a CAT 5 cable from my brother-in-law).Had the construction of the body of the lens been of better quality, I probably wouldn't have needed to do any repairing.  So as most people say, this is a flimsy lens.  But for the price, I cannot complain (you do get what you pay for).  Would I rather have the metal f/1.4 model for 4 times the price?  You bet.  Was it available in any shop when I was there?  No.  Until it breaks again, I'll keep using it.  Then I'm getting the good one.""

Like most lenses, both 50mm's are not at full sharpness wide open and the 1.4 just gets sharper faster at any aperture.  And if you're buying this for speed (and pretty much most are) then you're looking to dabble in the art of depth of field.  The 1.4 again, simply does this much better with smoother bokah (blur) in the out of focus areas.  It took me a while to realize that all those little pentagons in the 1.8's bokah where due to the bargain 5 blade aperture and made me realize why I needed to belly up for  the 1.4.  Of course all those things are even better with the 1.2 but for my money, the 1.4 is really the sweet spot of price/performance in the lineup.  Your mileage may vary.""

"20091105","5.0","Sweet low light lens for cheap","Bought this lens so I could start taking better pictures in low light and play more with depth of field (and also because it's CHEAP for such having such a low aperture value).Right now I have the 18-55 IS and 55-250IS kit and this addition was much needed for shooting indoors. Even with the image stabilization and non-moving objects these lens just do not make for very sharp pictures indoors without a tripod. The 50mm on the other hand does!However, I do a lot of my picture taking outdoors and the real reason I bought this lens was for the fun you can have with depth of field. This lens makes for excellent portraits along with giving the ability for more artistic shots because of it allows for focusing in on a single point while blurring the rest.""
"20091102","5.0","50mm options for Canon","Once upon a time, an SLR came with a 50(ish) mm 'standard' lens with a maximum aperture of somewhere in the f 1.4-2.0 range. Today a 28-70mm (or digital equivalent) zoom is usually kitted with an SLR. This has a maximum aperture generally in the f 4.0-5.6 range. That's something like 1/2 to 1/4 the light gathering ability, and often considerable optical quality, given away in exchange for cheap zooms.If you're looking at this, then you've probably decided on a 50mm or so prime lens, likely because the kit zoom lens is both slow and not very good quality. Here are the options for Canon:Canon 50mm f/1.8 (version 2): It's inexpensive, very fast compared to any cheap zoom and exceptionally good for the price. On the down side, it's cheap feeling, noisy in focusing, and difficult to focus manually. You should buy at least this.Canon 50mm f/1.4: A little bit faster, but that's a less important trait these days with good digital high effective ISOs. More importantly, it's robust, easy to use, with full-time manual focusing (you can just grab the ring even when it's autofocusing), and good image qualitySigma 50mm f/1.4: More expensive than the Canon lens, but slightly better image quality wide open. It's a tough sell since the quality change isn't huge. But if the extra money and Sigma logo don't bother you, then go for it.Canon 50mm f/1.2: Big money for that extra light-gathering ability. If you need this for photographing in a club, then you'll buy it. If you don't need it, it's too expensive and heavy to compete with the lenses above.Another, used, option, the original Canon 50mm f/1.8 EF lens was sturdier and better built, but they're only available used and possibly abused. I own one and am happy with it. I have shot with the Canon f/1.4 as well and that's the lens that I'd buy today.""

I don't care what the price is but this lens is nothing short of a miracle. I understand Canon has a 1.4 and a 1.2 and I am sure they are great lenses but for what this one can do, I think it is a great lens. Bokeh is exceptional, and the IQ is extremely good. If you know what you are doing, you can take professional level pictures with this baby. Some of my best potraits have been taken with this lens. At this time I cannot think of a good reason to spend the extra $300 + for the 1.4, let alone the 1.2. I am more than happy with mine.""

Of course it was $30 cheaper when I bought it 2004. The first lens would have lasted longer had I not have had a run in with 'Butter Fingers'. :)The second one is still built the same and still takes great picturesThis lens is amazing indoors with lower light.  I shoot with no flash in aperature priority, so I can make the proper adjustments.  Hand holding the camera I would 70% to 80% come out the way I had hoped.  Putting this thing on the tripod increases that to 90% to 100%.Once the sun starts going down I throw on my 580 flash and bounce it off the ceiling and the picture still come out great.I always recommend this lens to my freinds who are just starting out in the Digital SLR world.  It is a minimum investment for getting quality shots.No it will never be as good as the 70-200MM IS 2.8... But what is  :DI gave it 5 stars based on the what you get for your money.

"20091013","5.0","Great, with a caveat","This is a great lens, allowing you to take sharp pictures without having to carry around big zoom lenses. If you have a cropped-frame body (e.g., XTi, 50D), though, it does become an awkward telephoto lens; so consider the 35mm or 28mm as well.""
"20091011","3.0","Ok for $100, but I should have waited and gotten the F1.4","This lens is OK, considering the price. The main problem I have with it is the focus.  Sometimes it doesn't focus on the point that its supposed to.  It also seems like it needs a lot of light to actually focus.  Also it looks cheap, but then again it was only $100.  If I were to do it again, I'd wait/save a little more and get the Canon 50mm F1.4 instead.  It has a bigger aperture, and the USM so I'm assuming the focus would be MUCH better.""

No its not the 'Prime' so to speak with the quality being on the weak side, but the technology is on the 'Prime' side. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a fixed lens and superb quality shots.

It WILL be useful, you WILL want the 1.4 anyhow, and it WILL break.really, it's made entirely of plastic that's not too far removed from bakelite and has a motor that sounds like a vespa buzzing by. After a couple weeks of taking what I thought to be good photos with  mine, the AF started to go. it would randomly short focus, in good light, on a tripod, at any distance short or far. since it would work and not, the micro focus adjustment would do no good. optically it's great, but mechanically you'll want the 1.4. there's actually some metal in it and it uses a piezo motor that's quicker and doesn't over adjust and have to back up. you'll use your 50mm a lot, it would be prudent to buy one that will last.""

"20090929","5.0","The infamous "nifty fifty"","If you're looking at adding one good prime lens on a budget to your camera arsenal, then look no further. This is one of the best bargain lenses out there of any camera manufacturer.But let's look at the price points for 50mm primes. The 50mm f/1.4 is nearly 4x the cost and the 50mm f/1.2 is nearly 12x the cost. This lens is a bargain and is fast and takes great photos and you can't go wrong with it. The image quality is amazing.However, it's loud, made of plastic and if you dropped it on a hard floor it might shatter into a good number of pieces. It's loud (you can feel it chugging along with the vibrations it sends through the camera).Nothing I'm saying hasn't said before in a number of countless reviews. I own this lens, and I've taken (what I think) are awesome photos with it. However, it's a $100 piece of glass and if it breaks, I'm not sure that I could justify moving up the ladder to the 50mm f/1.4 for a slightly faster, slightly better image quality and a better constructed lens.If you've got a Canon digital SLR, pick this lens up. You'll find it very valuable and doesn't take up much room in your bag. You'll have fun with it and if it breaks, you won't cry that much over it compared to a far more expensive one. And if it does, buy another - you're still saving money over the 50mm f/1.4.""
"20090928","4.0","Hard to fault this lens given the price and alternatives","Pros:-Sharp-Nice contrast and color-fast-cheapCons:-poor build-clunky AF system-due to clunky AF system and the shallow DOF at f1.8, Focus can be innacurate at times-hard to manual focus due to short throw and poor MF ring-Somewhat 'harsh' bokeh unless using wide open, but honestly this flaw is overstated.  It is not that bad-soft-ish wide open, although not any more than most fast lensesBottom line, you can't really do better for the price.  Even if you want to spend 4-5x as much, the Sigma 50 1.4 has AF troubles, and the Canon 50 1.4 is known for quality and durability issues.  The uber-expensive 50 L has the famous focus shift issues, too.  So really, despite a few flaws, this is a great option for the 50mm length.  It has quirks, but they can be forgiven based on the cost.  At least you aren't paying 4-16x as much for a 'nicer' lens that still has its quirks.""

"20090914","5.0","Excellent, inexpensive lens","PROS:  Low price, clear images, wide apertureCONS:  Lower quality housingRECOMMENDED FOR:  Beginning and intermediate photographersI was extremely impressed with this lens from the first time I attached it to my camera.  I originally got it to take better low-light, higher-speed indoor pictures, which it does fantastically well.  The wide aperture is also excellent for taking shallow depth of field photos.  The fixed focal length makes me try harder to compose shots (because I have to move my feet rather than the lens) resulting in better photos.  The low price makes it a low-risk investment.  I've found myself leaving this lens on my camera when it's in the bag and using it more than my other two (Canon 18-55mm and 55-250mm).As other reviewers have pointed out, the housing for the lens is of lower quality than, say, my other two lenses.  However, it is not as flimsy as those reviewers would have you believe.  If you treat the lens and camera as though they were expensive, high-end equipment rather than toys, you will not have problems.If you're an advanced/professional photographer, you probably aren't even reading this review.  If you're a beginning or intermediate photographer who is looking for an inexpensive departure from your existing zoom lenses or looking to expand your horizons, this is an excellent lens for you to try.For further reading on this type of lens, I recommend you check out:[...]""

"20090912","3.0","Nice optical quality, but a little flimsy","I bought this lens when I bought my XSi on the recommendation of a friend, who to be fair, did warn me that it was lightweight. Loved it when I first got it. Nice sharp shots, good color, so much faster than the kit lens that came with my XSi. It's nice and light, but that came at the price of durability - I'd had mine for about 4 months (and I shot about 1500-2000 shots with it - as I said, I loved it), but after going through airport security on the way to Chicago and having my bag searched and unpacked by TSA, the next morning the front came completely off when I tried to remove the lens cap. This particularly sucked because it was on my way out and not on my way home so I was one lens short for my whole trip.All that said, you can't find better performance at the price range. If you're looking for a starter prime lens, this is hard to beat. Yes, it's more fragile than the f1.4, but it's also less than a third of the price.If you'd like to see some shots I took at an outdoor concert with it, check http://jpb.smugmug.com/Music/Cake-at-WWDC-09/""

The first day, I arrived in Gdansk, Poland and it was already getting dark. By the time we got checked into the hotel it was already quite dark, but we decided to explore the old town at night.  I put on my brand new 50mm F1.8 lens knowing I would be taking night shots if I could get any shots at all.All I can say is WOW.  I was able to take shots at F1.8 that I just cannot believe.  I lost very few pictures to camera shake even though the lighting conditions were poor and I was well beyond range of a flash.  I took almost 200 photos my first night using this lens and I lost maybe 5%.  Once I got the hang of shooting in low-light conditions I was absolutely blow away by this hundred dollar lens.Not that low-light is the only condition where this lens shines.  The 50mm f1.8 lens is really great for taking portraits where it produces extremely sharp, clean results.  I took the best picture I've ever taken with this lens.

"20090805","4.0","Good prime lens.  Construction is only okay","First, if you buying a prime lens for the first time - be sure you know how to use one.With an aperture this big, you will be able to create the soft background that is highly desired in portrait/macro photography.  While this lense is not a 'macro' per say, you can definately get some very close in shots.When you take it out of the box, you will notice that it is made of plastic.  The construction is not that great.  This lens is not a USM so in focusing, it sounds rough.  Some people question its durability, but if you take care of your stuff, this lens although cheap should serve you well.Taking photos, you will notice how bright the images are, opening the aperture all the way to 1.8 will provide you with a very 'soft' background.  However, you will need to be very careful when doing this and compose your shots right otherwise, the effect of the aperture setting may ruin the shot.  Some people don't like this lense because of this.Anyway, its a great little and cheap 'Nifty Fifty' and most photographers who compose portraits would probably want one of these in their lens portfolio.  The price is right for this lens.  Its a bit noisy and the construction seems cheap but it does the job.  If you want a more durable version of this lens look to the Sigma 50mm F1.4 or the equivalent Canon but both of those are priced in the $400 - $500 range.""

"20090802","5.0","Light and Tight Nifty Fifty","This is a very good lens for beginners. It is fast and does very good in low-light situations (just open it up and bump the ISO).There may be other lenses with a better Bokeh, but they are way more $$$$$-expensive-$$$$$ than this.  If you're just printing regular sized photos (4x6's and 5x7's), you won't notice any difference. The lens is light, a plus when you have to carry your camera for hours. The plastic casing is fine as long as you don't drop it. It's so cheap, just get another one if you break it.I highly recommend every n00bs to get one. This lens is a very good way to learn the basics of SLR photography.""
"20090731","5.0","Great Everyday Lens and what a BARGAIN!","I am just now getting back into SLR based photography and thus want to load up on some glass.  Unfortunately some of the lenses I want are a bit out of my budget for the time being.  I wanted to get something basic for my Rebel T1i and asked my brother (a pro) what he thought about this lens.  He said he owns it...while that was enough for me, I decided to get more information.  He said, simply put and I quote: 'This is a great VALUE and a lens that you can use every day.  While it is not the sharpest lens in its category, you would be hard pressed to find anything close in this price range....GET ONE'I, of course, listened and purchased one immediately.  I have been taking some shots from our backyard of the sunset...since we have a rather nice view and I love sunsets.  The pictures are stunning and this lens is now permanently mounted on my camera body.Great beginners glass at a great price. 5/5""

Gorgeous pictures, shoddy casing.  Now that I'm taking photography a lot more seriously going to buy the 1.4, but for casual use, DEF buy one of these.  Great for group photos/portraits. Great for low light settings.""
"20090719","5.0","Get creative!","I love this lens. In fact, it just stays on my camera. Well I got Canon Rebel XSi. Only other lens I have right now is the kit lens, 18-55mm.So yes with 1.6x crop factor, the actual focal length on my camera become 80mm. This can be sometimes annoying as I have to step back, a lot for some shots.However, for most close up portrait shots, this is perfect lens. I love shooting at 1.8 aperture size because then everything else is blurred out. Of course, you have to be careful that you focused on right object and whole object is in focus. Sometimes I focus on one eye and other eye is out of focus.Oh I love flower photography with this lens because it is so easy to blur out the background.I use this lens for creative or artistic photos. For regular or travel photos, this lens will be too hard to work with. Right now, I use kit lens when on vacation. My next lens is going to be 28mm-135 IS USM Canon's lens. That should be perfect for travel and everyday shooting.""

"20090716","5.0","Incredible value","There are already over 900 reviews on this. I just want to add my 2 cents here. I am not a professional photographer. This lens is of incredible value to me. The major complaint about this lens is build quality. Yes, it plastic. But I really don't feel that it is going to break any time soon. Besides, it is only around $100. It should be in the camera bag of every amateur photographer.""
"20090714","5.0","Perfect!","Great lens at a great price! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! Image quality is better than I expected! It's great to finally have a lens that 'sees' what I see ... and then produces that image!""
"20090710","5.0","Buy it now. You will NOT regret it.","This lens is a no-brainer. It's always right around $100 and it wins over most other, more expensive lenses. When I bought my 40d, I got the Canon 17-85mm USM IS lens. Well, to be honest, I hardly even use that lens anymore. And it retails for around $600! Sure, it might have a more versatile range than this fixed 50mm lens, but the image quality and speed of this lens is enough (in my opinion) to make me leave the other one in the bag 90% of the time. I owned a canon 70-200mm f/4L lens. Here is what I think of the whole 'L' thing: give it up people. They are way overpriced, ugly (seriously, who wants an off-white lens on their all-black camera? The only reason I can think of is so that everyone else knows they're toting around an L lens), and the image quality isn't much better (not better in the case of this insanely cheap 50mm lens!). So don't waste your money on an L lens, especially when you could be taking the best photos you'll ever take with a lens that costs over 10 times less. Remember that this lens is plastic, so just be careful with it and it won't break. I've had mine for over a year now, and it has no signs of wear. Also, being plastic, this lens is incredibly light! It makes walking around all day while taking photos amazingly easy. Don't second guess this lens, and more importantly, don't opt for the more expensive 50mm f/1.4 lens either! This lens produces cleaner images at 1/4 the price. Make sure to buy a good Hoya or B+W UV haze multi-coated filter for this thing!(and any lens for that matter) It will improve your images. (don't buy cheap filters!)Pros: Cheap!, outstanding image quality (even compared to an L lens), light weight, fast!(f/1.8), great portrait lens.Cons: plastic (but it's not really a con in my opinion. It reduces weight, and makes it cheaper. Just treat your equipment with care and this won't be an issue. And if it does break for some reason, you can always buy another one, and you would have still paid less in total than the more expensive version!)I think that with over 900 reviews on how awesome this lens is, you should just add it to your cart, checkout, and get it over with. I guarantee this lens will stay on your camera more than any other lens you own.""
"20090709","4.0","Excellent One","I bought this for my Canon EOS XS. It was really worth the money. You can see the difference when you take night snaps.

"20090708","4.0","great lens for shallow DOF","the f1.8 does a great job in creating bokeh and shallow DOFwhen we have the correct focus, it is razor sharp. When light level falls , this lens completely gives up focusing. That's too bad because sometime I think that's the f1.8 and the ability to work in lowlight condition is the reason for buying this lensanyway, it's still a prime lens and optic quality is good enough to keep it with me after a first few shot here :[...]""
"20090704","5.0","Great lens for novices and pros alike","I am by no means a professional photographer, but I am very impressed with what this lens can do. This is the third lens in my collection so far, and am very pleased with the quality of photos that come from it compared to the others I have. It allows you to capture amazing photos in low light conditions, and gives an opportunity to capture images almost exactly as can be seen by the human eye. Some reviews and complained about the plastic housing of the lens, but I have not had an issue. I have had my Canon XTi for about 3 years, and have not broken a single lens. I guess it all depends on how hard you use your things. If you are continually dropping your lenses, you may have an issue. Since I keep everything in a padded case and always have the neck strap on, I have not had a problem.I would strongly recommend this lens to anyone looking to capture low-light or portrait images, as it seems to excel in both categories for me. Good luck and happy shooting!""

"20120305","4.0","Great Value","I have a Canon T2i. I purchased this lens after many friends told me it was the go to lens for video with a DSLR. I have a successful business shooting weddings and other events. I currently own a Canon HV20 and a Canon HV30. I had a wedding last night and dropped my rate to accomodate a couple on a tight budget. Due to this I decided to shoot with my new T2i as there would be a shorter transfer time and I wasn't getting paid as much as I normally do. This wedding was booked, literally, 12 hours before it occurred. This was the first time I'd shot a wedding with a DSLR. I have a mixed review...When the 50mm is on, it's ON! It looks absolutely incredible at times. I cannot stress this enough. There are times when this lens alongside a great Canon camera looks unbelievable. Like true film. However, the focus is a bother. If you want to focus on a subject you have to do it before you start recording. And it's specific to that length. If you move forward or backward the picture is completely out of focus. Then you have to focus manually. I've read other reviewers say their fingers get into the picture. That's not true. Although, the zoom mechanism is at the very end of the lens, I practically tried to put my fingers in the picture while adjusting the focus/zoom and couldn't do it. It definitely takes some getting used to, but you won't ruin your shots with a finger in your frames. I have long fingers and it wasn't a problem for me at all.This is a great lens. But if you're going for straight video go for an actual video recorder such as; the HV20, HV30 or HV40. Or have at least one more videographer with you at your shoot. It's just not the most reliable lens. It'll mess up or drop frames from time to time. This is mainly just a DSLR statement, but the HV20 & 30 are FAR better for the price. If you want photo and video this is your thing. Just get used to auto-focussing and doing it quickly. For $110 it's a good investment and a necessary lens. Everyone should have one. Bottom line.""

"20090623","5.0","Worth every penny, an essential lens","I sold my 50mm F1.4 and bought this because I didn't think there was a big difference between them. Honestly, there isn't. Unless you are a pro that shoots with the 1.4 every day then you probably won't be able to tell the difference in picture quality. The build quality is less to be sure, but not any worse than their kit lenses that come with the Rebel series cameras. Also, it doesn't have the USM motor, but it's still faster than most aftermarket brand focusing motors it seems. Get this lens, you won't regret it.""
"20090619","5.0","This should be the first lens you buy","If you are new to photography, this lens makes for a great entry level prime lens that will help you understand aperture and show you how selective you have to be when shooting a prime lens.For the money, you won't be missing one bit and the f/1.8 is great for low light shooting or excellent bokeh.For those with cameras with HD video capabilities, this lens has the potential to stay on your camera the whole time.My only complaint is that on a crop sensor, its pretty narrow. This could be a good thing when shooting portraits, but makes it weak for a walk-around lens. Another complaint is that the build is moderate and it's made of plastic. Yet after those two negatives, I still give it 5 stars because it's still such a great lens. I've owned this lens for two years yet it still looks brand new, even after regular use and for the most part, I can deal with the narrowness of the lens.""

The subject, whether it's a person or a salad really pops and the colors couldn't be more vibrant.  I've had no problems with the overall quality or construction.  I've used it for over 2 months now hauling it with me on vacations to Europe, to graduations and elsewhere and it has performed magnificently.  I think that anyone who is interested in portrait photography should look into this lens.  Oh, and I forgot to mention, as far as lenses go it's relatively inexpensive.""

I then took shots of him with shallow DOF that barely focused beyond his nose at times.  They came out stunning.  For the money, quality, and speed, this lens cannot be beat.

"20090521","5.0","This should be the growing photographer's second purchase","After buying a body and using what will probably be the standard kit lens that shipped with it, you're shopping for a new lens.  Yeow!  $600 or more for a prime portrait lens?  $300 minimum pricetags are making you (or your mate!) are rethink this photography hobby?Enter the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8, called Canon's 'stealth prime' lens by many internet reviewers.  Yes, it's lightweight and plastic-y, but the bang for the buck is truly awesome.  The interior hardware of this lens is a top-notch thoroughbred, even if the exterior is like a plastic naugahyde saddle.  It's the PHOTOS that count, right?  So buy it for the great hardware and the consistently great photograhic results it produces.For starters, if you're using a digital SLR, this 1.8 actually stops down to an equivalent of around 1.4, so that background bokeh blur one aims for in portrait photography is even softer than you'd expect.  I'll be honest and say that Canon's prime ($380ish if I remember, maybe more) version of this lens gives absolutely velvety backgrounds while this budget model is more like high quality velveteen.  But still, it's a welcome step in the right direction if you're looking to explore portraiture on a budget.  The notes I get from my professional photographer buddies are routinely along the lines of 'that's with that $80 lens you bought?  Wow!'Many professional reviewers go on at length about how the inside of this lens is truly close to pro quality, housed in a cheapo body.  Do a little web searching and you'll see what I mean.  I treat my lenses well and haven't had the catastrophic failures that some have reported.  (I mean, are these guys rock climbing or playing roller derby with these cameras or something?)I've read that 'downsizing' from a zoom lens to a fixed 50mm is a great excersise in growing as a photographer and now that I've done it, I agree.  Working with a fixed lens gets you more involved with your subject and this more intimate connection can really show in your work.  I keep this 50mm on my camera as my 'main lens' now and only rarely break out a zoom lens unless it's absolutely needed.Once you play with this budget lens, you'll likely want to try to find a top-of-the-line lens that can give results this good at a distance.  You'll want a zoom lens that can stop down to 1.8 or lower.  That's when you'll cry to find that you're moving into minimum $600 range and into the $1000+ for some lenses.  And at that point, you'll think 'wow, that little fixed 50mm f/1.8 was a steal.'I was on the fence between buying this budget lens and saving up for the pro version and I'm really glad I got it as a gift.  That let me try it out on its own merit with no buyers' remorse.""
"20090519","5.0","Performs beyond expectations.","I just started using this wonderful little lens with my new 500D and I'm blown away!  I have the 18-55mm kit len and the EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS lens and this one blows both of those away.  All of my shots with this was hand held, many taking shots of moving subjects and many being shot from a moving vehicle.  Now one thing about he vehicle I was shooting from should explain even further how wonderful this lens is.... it's an armored Suburban with bulletproof tinted glass over 1' thick!People have lowered the star rating for this lens due to it's plastic build.  Now c'mon, this lens costs less than $100 and performs better than lens' costing 10X as much.  There are many people who have reviewed this lens who say they've owned it for several years with no signs of wear.  If you handle this the same way you would handle an 'L' lens, then it will last you nearly as long.At full zoom on my 55-250mm compared to the 50mm shot of the same landscape, the  pictures from the 50mm f/1.8 is much sharper and that is under close scrutiny of every aspect of the two photos zoomed in to maximum magnification in Photoshop CS4 Bridge.As already mentioned, I took several shots from a moving vehicle with safety glass that as over 1' thick with heavy tint.  I shot close up portrait type photos, medium distance landscape, and very far off landscape, all from a moving vehicle.  Every shot made when I had my camera settings correct were keepers.  I've never had a lens that could do this, not even close.Long story short; you can't go wrong with this purchase.  Buy one, play with it, and fall in love with it.  If you must have the big brother to this lens and are willing to fork out the extra $$ then go for it.  But, for the rest of us who are happy with a lens that will PERFORM at nearly the same level, but feel like a toy, I'll stick with the f/1.8 II and be grinning from ear to ear because I can use that money for much better things.""

When I came across the Canon EF 50mm on Amazon, saw all the great reviews, the great price, and the wondeful photos posted I knew I had to order it.  Times have been tough in this economy, but not too tough to get this inexpensive and incredible lens (hopefully).  So far the quality of the photos are incredible!  This lens is so worth the money and it only makes you crave photography and all without breaking the bank.""

"20090428","5.0","I like it","I like this lens.It is small and light.Doesn't seem too cheap to me, but I don't have too much to compare it to.The bokeh does have five points to it. The circles turn out to be pentagons.I have to stand back more than I am used to.  I think this is due to the 1.6 crop factor on my camera.  Makes it more like an 80mm lens.I have to zoom with my feet.I have to stay more aware of composure and placement of the subject.It takes great pictures.It is fast.It's a little noisy... I don't need a quiet one at this point though.I like it.""
"20090427","5.0","Amazing lens for the $$$","Wether you are on a budget or not, this is the lens to have in your bag. Great for portraits. It's crystal clear. Sharpest lens I own. Love it. Great shallow depth of field. The nifty fifty is a lens EVERY photographer should have.""
"20090427","4.0","Nice piece of glass","This is one of those lenses you just get.  It's under $100, it takes pretty sharp shots, and the 1.8 gives you pretty good 'Bookeh.'  Because it's 50mm, I wouldn't say it's an everyday lens, especially indoors in tight spaces because the focal length is too long.""
"20090426","5.0","A great, great lens for the price...","When I decide to switch to digital equipment and began 'testing the waters', so to speak, this was the second lens I purchased.  About 35 years ago based upon the advice of the renown photographer Hans Namuth, I purchased a reasonable good camera and my first 50mm lens, and never regretted it.  A 50mm is a great portrait lens. Optically it's identical to the human eye, (what your unimpeded eye sees is also what your camera will record while using this lens).  As glass go's, it's not the best but for picture quality it easily surpasses many Canon L lens.  I don't much care for the plastic body of the lens.  This lens is a f/1.8, Canon makes faster 50mm lenses which are more costly, but for the money this an outstanding lens.  While I've faster and better 50mm lenses I often still use this lens.  I can whole heartedly recommend this lens to novices as their first prim lens, if not their very first lens.""
"20090425","4.0","Does what it says","The lens was great.  Very clear and very nice shallow depth of field.  My only complaint has nothing to do with the lens but the camera itself.  I was hoping this lens would be a good all around lens.  But since my slr has a 1.6 magnification (canon xti), i find myself backing up A LOT with this lens because my subject is just too close.  By the time I get far back to get my whole subject (i.e. a person from head to toe) in frame, i feel disconnected from the subject.  I'm so far away and anyone could easy cut in front of my without knowing... I'll still keep the lens but I wished I got a different one as my first lens (besides the kit).""
"20090424","4.0","Very high value lens for beginers","As many others said, this is a very high value lens. It have a plastic body and lens, which is not so strong. However this offer its light weight for travelling. It still give quiet sharp images with a proper aperture. If I want a blurred background, I have a relatively big aperture range to play with. I like it.There is a small problem, the screw for fix filters in the front seems quite tight when match with Tiffen 52mm UV Protection Filter. I also saw this problem, with my friend's lens(The same one). He match it with also a 52mm UV Protection Filter, quite tight, too.""

"20090421","5.0","The single best buy for a Canon DSLR","At the price (around $100 at the time or writing) this is simply a steal.The glass in this lens is the same as the expensive L Series lenses - so the quality of your shots is unsurpassed, but the construction is a LOT cheaper (it's all plastic, rather than all metal). That is why this lens is cheap, they haven't compromised on the glass at all.It's a fantastic lens that everyone should have at their disposal - sharp, lovely DoF, the only criticism is that the aperture blades will create 5 sided light bokeh, rather than small round bokeh. This is minor, and in a lens this cheap, rather forgivable.Plus - THE APERTURE! f/1.8? You can shoot some lovely shots with it in low light. It's not the quietest auto-focus (as it's not a USM lens) but it's hardly loud unless you are specifically needing total quiet - in which case you should be manual focusing anyhow.my tip - get a high quality UV filter and leave it on it. This means that not only will you be protecting the lens but you'll have the metal filter ring to screw attachments into rather than the plastic threads of the lens.Anyhow - this lens used to retail for $80-90, but seems to be getting more expensive. Pick it up as soon as you can. It's a steal.""
"20090421","5.0","Fast lens, so much fun to use!","I didn't have a lot of money to enter the digital SLR age, so I purchased a used XSI from someone in my local camera club, and got this lens to go with it.  I absolutely love it.It is fast and so sharp!  This is warp speed faster than a point and shoot, which can really take a second or two to focus, and then has that lag when you depress the shutter button.I can shoot in relatively low light and still get great clarity - something I could not do with my p&s.  I can get within 1.5 feet to take macro-like shots of flowers and details, or stand back for a wider-angle view.  I love the crispness of my pictures.The only con might be it's a bit noisy, but for the most part this doesn't faze me.At some point I'd like to get a zoom, but this lens is a great deal, is very versatile, and will keep me happy for quite a while.  Highly recommended.""

The background blur is fantastic when focusing within 2-3 feet, and the clarity is exceptional.  I just couldn't be happier. Who cares if it is plastic.  This compares with other $500+ lenses, meaning you would have to buy at least 6 before losing money to the others for equivalent performance. It's definitely the first lens you should consider to buy when upgrading to SLR from point and shoot.  It is a real confidence booster for the novice (my wife, for example; she can't put the camera down now!)...""
"20090417","5.0","Incredible lens for the price","25 years ago when I was taking photography in school this is the type of lens I used. I loved that old camera and lens combo and I took and developed thousands of pictures with it. Because of this I was excited to get this lens. It does not disappoint. I have taken several hundred pics with it now and it's incredible. I use a Rebel XT body and am very happy with the pictures that I've taken with this combo so far. If all that you are used to now is the stock lens that came with your camera and are curious about expanding you can not go wrong here. It's inexpensive because of the materials used but it still takes excellent quality pictures. I'd recommend getting one of these before the big zoom lens. I think it has more uses. Whichever order you get them in, this one is a must have.""

"20090416","3.0","cheap price cheapish performance","I got this lens for a canon rebel xs.  I also have the 18-55mm IS kit lens and a sigma 30mm 1.4 lens for comparison.  I was some what hesitant in getting this lens based on the mixed reviews and now that I have owned it, i figured that i'll weigh in.  First the good points.  1) it is cheap, the cheapest lens that canon makes, 2) its 1.8 aperature is fast, 3) it can be sharper than the kit lens.  4) its focal length on a crop sensor (approx 81mm) makes it a decent portrait lens.Here are my reservations.  1) build, it is made of plastic and light (as long as you don't abuse it, i don't see this being a huge problem), 2) focal length on a corp sensor makes this very poor group pictures indoors, a 30mm prime would be much better for this (approx 50mm on a crop body), 3) autofocus is somewhat noisy and slow. 4) while it can be sharp, color and contrast are lacking compared to other lenses.Overall i guess it is cheap enough to buy one to play with.  I don't think I would purchase it again knowing what i now know.  The 30mm sigma 1.4 is a much better lens but of course cost 3-4 times as much.""

Fantastic for the low-natural-light, where a flash isn't appropriate.""
"20090414","3.0","Good for price but depends on your needs","Good lens considering the sub $100 price. Image quality was good and the f/1.8 was nice in low light situations. The one major drawback for me was the slow auto focus. Since I wanted this lens for indoor high school sports like volleyball and basketball that was a deal-breaker. I tried it out for a couple of games and it just could not keep up with a moving player. I returned it in favor of the pricier F/1.4 USM which will hopefully do better.""

This is quickly becoming one of the best bargains I have ever purchased.As a lens sitting on your table it has almost no use. I mean this because its not heavy enough to be a paperweight, let alone a lens.... but it is.It is as others have said a plastic pile of plastic, but what cheap thing isn't?The construction wont take a fall, so don't drop it.  If you do drop it, buy another one, and then drop that one, and then you might be near the cost of a metal lens... or should I say mostly metal lens.The important part are the optics, and speed.  Its fast, and mostly crisp.  I say mostly crisp because the focus near near the extents is not perfect, so I try and stay slightly off the limit.This review is random I know, but moral of the story, I would buy 2 of these before I bought the closest $200 option.Josh""

I don't worry about being rough on it; it's practically disposable at this price. It's a bit noisy, but relatively fast. Glass is superior considering its construction.""

"20090324","5.0","Superb bang for the buck","Anyone complaining about this lens is asking too much of it. It's an f/1.8 lens for $86. It is worth every penny of that $86. If you want a pro-grade lens, pay more and get the f/1.4. If you just want an nice starter lens that performs great (within limits), do NOT hesitate to buy this lens. It can SO expand the range of what you can do -- more so than any other accessory you can buy for $86. Works excellently on my 20D, and my first gig I completed with it paid for the lens several times over.I did not experience any of the undesirable pentagon-bokeh issues, but nothing I was shooting had hard point lights, so maybe I just avoided it. It can have difficulty auto-focusing at low-light, but other lenses of mine are no better. I did not find the noise or focus speed to be problematic.I might buy the f/1.4 in a year or so if I find this one inadequate, but in the mean time, the money I saved will go towards other accessories I need more.Plastic fantastic it is, in spades.""

"20090316","3.0","Excellent deal, but upgrade if you can afford it","I purchased this lens as my first Canon prime lens and to use in low light and indoors.  For the price, this lens is a heck of a deal.  All the images I got with this lens at f/4 or slower were very good quality, very sharp, and very good color contrast.  I recently sold this lens, and this review is based on my experience with the 50mm f/1.8 EF II while I had it (for about a year).I would caution any potential buyers that this lens is not built well.  The plastic body cracks easily, so be sure to take good care of this when it's in your bag and on your camera.  My first copy of this lens got broken the first week I had it while in my gadget bag.  I replaced it the next day.Furthermore, between f/1.8 and f/2.8, autofocusing is a bit of a nightmare.  I was unable to autofocus 80% of the time with this lens wide open and only able to autofocus about 60% of the time at f/2.8.  I originally thought that it could be a problem with my copies of the lens.  I sent it back to Canon, and was told that the lens is working 'as built.'  I've found many other reviewers who have had similar difficulties with this lens in this aperture range.However, at f/4 or slower, the lens delivers nicely and consistently.  The autofocus works nicely at slower apertures as well.  For the price, if you're willing to deal with the drawbacks of this lens, then it is worth purchasing.If you are purchasing this lens to use in low light or indoors, save your money and purchase the 50mm f/1.4 instead.  It is built much better, is much more durable, has much faster autofocusing, and is overall a much better lens.  I rented the 50mm f/1.4 and was very happy with it while I used it.However, if this lens fits your budget better, then it's definitely worth purchasing and will perform well enough as long as you keep it away from the 'wide open' range (i.e. f/1.8-f/2.8)""
"20090316","3.0","It was my favorite lens until it broke...","I've had this lens for three months and I LOVED it.  I bought it knowing that there were many reviewers who had problems with it breaking easily.  But I didn't have $350-$400 to spend so I bought the cheaper option.  Is the price to good to be true??  In this case I really think it is.  The construction is just so cheap.  A slight bump while still in the padded camera bag was all it took to break some little plastic piece inside and the whole front of the lens fell off.  So if you buy this lens, just know that it is EXTREMELY fragile.As for me, I'll just wait until I can afford to replace it with the pricier f/1.4.  I want a lens that is going to last.""

When it works, it's great, which is why I gave it three stars.  The problem is, it doesn't work lot of the time.  I often shoot in low light, and this lens can not focus! It's ridiculous to have a 1.8 ability and blurry pictures. The focusing motor is LOUD too.  The lens just keeps going in and out trying to focus and rarely finds it. I often have to turn the auto-focus off and focus it myself.  It's very frustrating since I'm doing a self-portrait project right now. I guess you get what you pay for.""

What about the bokeh 'quality'?  What about that 'investment for the future' thing?Seems like there are several camps of personalities in play here.  Are these discriminating minds who take every pixel seriously and need such justifications?  Is it the mere 'knowing that you have the best available' that produces the best photo?  Basically, is pride that's producing the best composition or your photographic ability and need?  I see plenty of wedding-advertisements that are ho-hum pictures taken with $1000s worth of equipment and visa-versa (my wife took the most amazing picture of our daughter with the cell phone a month back).So to me, this purchase is part psychology and part necessity.  It's a great lens for the price - no doubt about it!  I can't say I could shoot THAT much better with the 1.4 to justify the price difference.  So what if you get a few more 'rays' in the bokeh of a candle.  Honestly, zooming in, I cannot perceive the 'irregularness' of the fuzz - kind of like most people can't tell the difference between 1080p and 720p on an HDTV set at 15 feet away from the couch.If you're having fun with photography like I am, will print only the very occasional large-format, will only be in a situation extremely rarely where a 1.4 MAY provide a somewhat better quality, and more importantly value a thing called money, then this is a wonderful lens for your arsenal of fun - highly recommend!  Now I'm going to go take the money I saved and buy another lens!Enjoy!""

"20090307","3.0","Disposable","This lens takes GREAT pictures, but when considering a purchase, keep in mind this is basically a disposable lens. It works great, when it is still working. I had mine for about 6 months and took some of my best pictures with my XTi and this lens. Then it stopped focusing. I can't use it at all anymore. Was it worth it? Yes. I say this because I was able to get temporary use out of a prime lens to see if it was a good fit for me, and learned that it was. Would I buy another one? No. But I would buy the 1.4 version. I would never have known how essential a prime lens was without first having tried this one.""

"20120229","5.0","The plastic fantastic delivers","I'm a professional photographer and I've owned this lens on three separate occasions over the past 8 years.  I've bought and sold a lot of gear and am very familiar with Canon 50mm lenses.  In addition to this lens, I've also owned the Canon 50/1.4 and currently own the Canon 50/1.2 L.I can confidently say this lens produced image quality that rival lenses costing many hundreds, upwards of a thousand dollars.  You won't find any full frame zoom lens under $1000 with this level of image quality.  Moving away from the 50mm focal length, you won't even find a prime this good for under $400.  This lens is so far ahead of others on the price to performance scale it's not even funny.  Third party manufacturers won't even attempt a 50mm F1.8 because there is no way they can do better than this lens at this price point.So for the position it occupies in the cheap prime category, the Canon 50/1.8 stands alone and nothing else comes close.So, what is it good at?  The benefits are many, I'll try to keep it concise.- It's small and light.  Smaller and lighter, in fact, than nearly all cruddy 'kit' lenses which come with cameras.- It's cheap.  Compared to other camera lenses, it's a terrific value.- It's very sharp.  At F1.8 it's usable and has nice bokeh.  Pushed down to F2.8 the bokeh weakens, but the optics become super sharp.- It has great color, contrast, and saturation.  This will be the first taste of prime optics for many of you considering this lens.  The look, rendering, and 'feel' of the images from this lens is addicting and very unique compared to that of a kit lens.  This lens really unleashes the true potential image quality of your DSLR.Why would you eventually sell this lens?- Build quality is 'lightweight' to put it mildly.  The body and mount is 100% plastic.  It's not even the high quality plastic used on other lenses, it's the plastic you might find on a 'made in china' toy that costs $15.  This is generally not a deal breaker though since the lens is so light.  Over the years I never managed to break mine, though the build isn't particularly inspiring.-  It's 'only' F1.8. The 50/1.4 lenses take in more light and have better bokeh.- The 50/1.4 lenses are typically a little sharper at large apertures.  At smaller apertures it's a tie.So in summary I find this lens to be a good fit for beginners and novices to get a sample of prime image quality without breaking the bank.  The focal length makes for a splendid portrait lens on both a full frame and crop camera.  The performance is all around very good and the price absolutely cannot be beat.""

I still tried to use the lens since I had read reviews about the lens taking on dust and usually its not a big deal unless its at the center.  One day of shooting and the sharpness I had been reading about just wasn't there.  Packed it up and returned it.  Love Amazon.Disappointed, was really looking forward to a sharp lens.

Unfortunately, when I wanted to switch back to my zoom lens, I found out that the lens was stuck on the XSI body. It turned half way and it would not turn further. I was lucky that camera and lens are still under warranty and Canon was able to help. I was told by Canon that something inside the lens must have come loose or shifted. This should really not happen. In over 20 years of using Canon cameras, this was a scary first... Please inspect your lens carefully and if the locking mechanism looks different from your current lens, or if it does not attach very smoothly right away, return it and do not use it.I hope this will help others in the future.Update: After 2 weeks, Canon send camera and lens back and both work fine now. Nevertheless, it cost me about $ 30 to ship the camera to Canon. Even though the lens works fine and I love the picture quality, I am a little nervous to use it. What if it gets stuck again?""

I also like the fact that this is a prime lens which makes you 'zoom with your feet'.Con's:I think the only con I could name about this lens is that the focus ring is really small which makes it slightly more difficult to manually focus for your close-up photography.Tip: Definitely think about getting a lens hood when you buy this lens""

The depth is little bit hard to control at f1.8, and you'd better have a good camera with sensible focus detector.I have now mounted this lens on my Canon EOS350D (Rebel) and the whole system is now very compact, close to the size of a G1!When used to zooming, it takes a little time to get use to move instead of zoom.Overall, I'm very happy with my new Xams lens.""

"20090207","5.0","A "must have" for beginning your SLR lens collection","This was my first lens purchase beyond the one that came with my DSLR camera, and so far I am very happy with the results. It delivers beautiful portraits, crisp closeups at maximum aperture, and the bokeh is astounding.I've seen other reviews that say this lens has a 'toy' feel. While it is true that it is lightweight, rather plain in design, and does not have a metal mount, the materials feel quite solid and in my opinion should stand up to normal useage.The focusing motor is a bit noisier than my original 'kit' lens, but no more than should be expected for the significantly lower price.But the bonus of being able to snap clearly-focused seemingly shake-free shots in limited light conditions makes this lens almost a necessity for any photographer who cares about being non-intrusive and wants to avoid using any flash devices or extra lighting.""

"20090202","4.0","Can't Beat this lens for the price!","2 years ago when I fist got into digital SLR photography, I only had a Canon Rebel XT with the EF-S 18-55 1:3.5-5.6 kit lens. I had read reviews on this lens and decided to jump on it. My girlfriend purchased the lens for me via Amazon. The lens was damaged in shipping and the barrel was cracked. Being stupid, I didn't return it because the lens worked anyway. A few months after using the lens, the internal elements just fell out during auto focus. They then hung by the delicate internal copper connections, which soon tore, leaving the lens useless. I did love the lens very much during the time I was using it though. The images are wonderfully sharp when he lens is closed down past f/2.8, and the low light capabilities and bokeh are GREAT at f/1.8 (although the lens is a little soft at these wide open apertures, they're still very usable). I bought myself another one, only I bought the Mark I (which was only sold for 1 year in 1987) and the build quality is MUCH better, but you'll be hard pressed to find one, so I recommend this lens to ANY canon user, especially those on a budget. What do you have to lose? You'll get wonderfully fast glass, practice with a prime lens, and very sharp photos. My girlfriend has now purchased a Canon Digital Rebel XSi and I returned the favor she did for me by buying her this same lens, I chose to get it at a retail store for $128 after tax in order to avoid the shipping worries, but I doubt Amazon lets damage like the one I encountered occur often, so if you want to save some money and take a little risk, order it from here.DISCLAIMER!!!!!!!: Be gentle with this lens, it is easily broken, I am not the only one to have shipping issues, and a larger group of people have had problems with the lens breaking when in perfect condition from a short 2 or 3 foot drop from a bed even onto carpet, so BE CAREFUL. Also, Amazon's picture for this product is wrong. They show the Canon EF 50 1:1.4 with a focus ring in the middle, a distance scale, and a metal lens mount, the EF 50 1:1.8 II has a horribly narrow manual focus ring at the end of the barrel, and a plastic lens mount, there is no distance scale.Filter mount and front lens element extend but do not rotate when focusing, this is good for polarizing filters, the lens does not come packaged with a lens hood but Canon does offer one(ES-62). Auto focus motor is arc type, and decently quick, although noisy, and not quite USM fast.""

"20090126","3.0","OK for $100","I bought this lens and really wanted to like it but found too many issues.1. My version was front focusing, creating soft pictures at the large aperature setting.  When manually focused the pics were center sharp.  Be sure to check your focus center sharpness when set to 1.8.2. Pics are soft at the edges when center focused correctly.3. Build is weak and leaves much to be desired.4. Bokah is horrible.  You can see odd shaped hexagons from background light points when they should be spherical.  This is actually the shape of the few aperature blades that struggle to create a circular openning.5. No full time manual focus so it's a pain to correct focus for wide aperatures when you need to.6. Focus ring is small and hard to use.It's an OK starter prime but not intended for serious photography.  I think people rate it high because it can produce a decently sharp pic when in focus at the smaller aperatures.  Relative to the other better and costlier 50mm prime options this is definitely not a 4 or 5 star product when comparing end picture quality.  As for return on investment... for me it's really a wash because you'll find yourself entually buying a better prime in the future.

(And the extra speed when you go to f1.4 or f1.2 is pretty much meaningless.)- In the APC-C world, this lens is a REALLY COOL portrait lens.  You gotta use this lens for taking pictures of babies, children, friends, parents, presidents, uncles, aunts, grandparents, corpses, pets, flowers, the North Star, etc.- While the f1.8 setting is (really) soft, you stop it down a little and you have a superb lens!  Try this: Stop it down to f22, put it on a tripod and take a picture of any still-life scene (flowers, Channukah candles, Christmas trees, your neighbor's I-want-you-to-be-able-to-read-by-the-strands-of-light-that-outline-my house, any city street).  You'll love the results.- One oddity.  I am used to having a UV filter on my lenses all the time.  This does not work very well on this lens, especially on these tripod pictures like city streets--there are some bad internal reflections of the bright spots.Did I say that you gotta have this lens?  Yeah.""

I took some test shots in low lighting and boy did this lens come through. It has great sharpness and color, and I would recommend it to anyone, and not mention, the price was right.""
"20090121","3.0","Lens maybe OK, Price different, & Packaging Attrocious!","I purchased a lens and filter. They charged me for the filter that was supposed to be a gift and the packaging consisted of two of the air filled bags in a box that should have had 4 at a minimum to keep things from bouncing around. The air bags arent shaped to stop things from flopping around. Where's the peanuts? Frankly I'm amazed it even works at all. When you get a box with a lens in it it doesn't make you happy to hear things rattling around in it. I'll have to try it now a week to make sure all the features work.  But I'll never know if the life has been shortened or when it stops a 3 months later if packaging was the problem and I'll have to pay for the return. I will never order something fragile again from these people.""
"20090121","4.0","Great lens for the money","'You get what you pay for,' truly applies to this lens.  It is lightweight, almost to the point of feeling like a toy lens.  Put it on your camera, however, and the magic begins.  The glass is excellent, though sharpness at wide-open settings is so-so. Otherwise photos are sharp. Focusing is slower and noisier than a USM lens.  But for $85 it's great.  If you want a high quality 50mm, spend the $$$ and buy the f1.4.""
"20090119","4.0","Canon's gift to the traveler, budget minded.","I bought this super cheap lens just to check the quality of a Sigma 24-60mm f2.8 zoom I purchased to use with the 5D.  I assumed the prime would be better, and it was in studio side by side comparisons.  The Sigma zoom is excellent and far more versatile, but there is a noticeable (if slight) sharpness and brightness advantage with the 50mm.  Photozone's excellent lens reviews site places this 50mm f/1.8 at -or (more often) above- the sharpness figures of all other tested Canon lenses from 50mm to ultrawide. It's tiny, it's light, and although it's relatively fragile, it could be replaced several times for the cost of an L lens.  On the negative side, focus accuracy on my 5D was only good, not great; focus speed was good; decent background blur; the noise not an issue for me. Sharp at f2and beyond.  Good portraits from a cropped camera, a bit short for full frame portraits.  If you travel light and use primes, this should be in your bag. A super buy, I'd say!""

With the 1.6 lens factor this makes the lens the idea focal length for portraiture.Because the focal length is fixed it may take a bit of getting used to.  However the initial frustration is well worth it.  I used it the first week I had it for three different photo shoots (both a combination of indoors, outdoors, and studio lighting).  Across all lighting situations the color was great.The wide aperture helps greatly in low light situations; however it is important to keep the depth of field in mind when focusing.Some mentioned the lens is poorly made.  This lens is also a very light weight lens.  Due to the fact that it has a fixed focal length and no IS it is very light weight making it wonderful for long hand held shoots.All these factors come together to make this a versatile powerful lens at a great price!""

On top of it, the narrow depth-of-field at that aperture blurs the background nicely for wonderful portraits.  I've heard the lens is rather fragile and the plastic construction is not durable, but keep in mind you are getting a fast SLR lens for close to a bill.  I have only had it a month but believe it will hold up well if you take care of it.

I am an extreme amateur so I still do a lot of experimenting with low light, ISO, etc. I still find it tricky to accurately select my focal point.  This lens really lets you know if you focused on the wrong object!  I've never realized how a flash really distorts color in a photo.  With this lens, set the ISO at 400 turn off the flash and be prepared for some really true colored, high quality photos.""
"20090110","2.0","Don't understand all the hype","I had this lens for a total of 2 days and returned it to the vendor.The majority of the reviews for this lens were good and the price was right so I figured I had nothing to lose by purchasing it.Upon taking the lens out of the box I did notice how light it was. After all, what would one expect for the price?Where this lens was disappointing was in its ability to focus consistently. I took about 30-40 sample shots at various exposure settings and the focus was hit or miss. The image quality for the in-focus pictures was pretty good, though. But with hit or miss focusing this lens just wasn't worth keeping in spite of the image quality.I'd consider this lens only if you have a lot of patience, are strapped for cash, and need something that has the potential of performing well in low light. Otherwise, just pass this one by and look at some of the other offerings by Canon and Sigma.""
"20090109","5.0","Good lens good price","First... yes it feels cheap.A bit like a plastic toy, I tried taking close pictures of a cat and the noise scared the cat away, twice.

I think it's great for anyone who is not a professional photographer and likes to get close to bugs, flowers, mushrooms, etc - like me for example.At the beginning 45cm distance between the lens and the object was getting a bit frustrating I used to basically get 3cm close with my old non-DSLR but at 12mpx once you check the picture at 100% you notice that 45cm is more than enough and you have a load of details that the old non-DSLR was not able to capture.I do recommend it if you like to take macro shots and you have an eye for detail.""

"20090105","5.0","The best lens to learn with","When I first got into photography, all I had was a Pentax K1000; a 100% manual film SLR with a Sears 50mm f2.8 lens.  I loved it.  I messed up a lot of shots, and learned from every one.Times have changed a lot, but the thing I love is that a fast 50mm lens will still help you learn so much about photography.  From framing your shots well to shutter and aperture settings, you will learn a LOT using this lens.  You will learn about depth of field very quickly.  You will learn about how much light you need at what aperture settings to properly expose the image...Yes, the lens feels so cheaply built it seems like it must have come out of a Happy Meal.Yes, it's slow and loud to focus.However, it takes a darn good picture.If you have recently bought a digital Rebel, buy this lens and leave it on your camera in lieu of the kit lens for a month of shooting.  You will learn so much about photography in that time!If you get serious about photography then you will end up buying lenses that cost much more than your camera did.  Stick this cheap lens on your new camera and you will learn so much that you can make better decisions on what expensive lenses to buy.For the price of this lens you have nothing to loose.Enjoy!KO""

"20090103","5.0","Great lens for the price","I've had this lens for about a week now and it pretty much is going to stay on my Rebel XSi with the exception of my 70-200mm 'L' lens. The bokeh is smooth which you can see by some of the pictures I've uploaded.It also works well for Astrophotography. I've used it to shoot the Horsehead Nebula and once we get a non-moonlit night I'm going to use it to shoot the Milky Way. I've gotten the Milky Way with the kit lens but I have a feeling this lens is going to be way better.The one and only thing I've noticed is that sometimes it hunts for Autofocus but I'm certain that's more me just getting used to the limitations of the lens pertaining to distance (too close to the subject).In any case,  just order it, it's easily one of Canon's better lenses. I would suggest that you get the hood with it, I did and found out that it really helps with glare when the light source is too the side""
"20090102","5.0","Great little lens for the price!","I bought this lens because of the price and because of the overall positive reviews. Sure, the construction is a little cheesy and the AF is pretty noisy, but it's a great little lens for portraits and the like for a beginning photographer on a budget. It's my first prime lens and I'm having a lot of fun with it. It's sharp, fast, and very lightweight. It's also great in low-light.To take sharper pictures, I usually have an aperture of about f/4 to f/8. Subjects tend to have a soft, creamy look if the aperture is wide open, which is good or bad depending on what you are going for and how you focus. I had trouble getting sharp shots because it was wide open, so I went to about f/4 for sharper shots following some advice from folks online. It really depends on what you're going for, however. I'm still playing with it and learning.Since it's not USM, the AF is very noisy, but it doesn't bother me that much at all.I definitely recommend this lens. The price is right and the shots it takes are amazing!""
"20090101","5.0","Small, Sharp, Fast, and Light","I use this lens with my Rebel XSi, and it takes fantastic pictures.  The first thing I noticed is the tiny size.  Even compared to the small kit lens, this thing is minuscule, and I love it.The aperture of this lens is only 1/2 stop slower than the 50mm 1.4 lens, but is 1/3 of the price.  I have a feeling this is due to the plastic nature of the camera, but if you're not a pro using a 1-series camera I doubt you're throwing your gear around or being rough with it.  I am not worried about the sturdiness, but if I find out otherwise I will update this review.On the other hand this lens is over 1 full stop faster than the much more expensive f/2.8 zooms, and over 3 stops faster than the kit lens at 50mm.  When you look through the viewfinder you will notice it's much brighter, and that's due to the maximum aperture.I initially held off on getting this lens due to the crop sensor of the Rebel series.  While the focal length is tight (80mm equivalent), especially indoors where the fast aperture is most useful, the quality of the pictures are worth it.  Using this indoors forces me to take mostly portraits, but that's fine with me.I was quite surprised at the quality of this lens.  I initially wanted it just to play around with the fast aperture, but the sharpness of the photos it takes is really quite good.  And of course playing around with the narrow depth of focus is fun also.Recommendation:While I love this lens, I wouldn't say buying it is a no-brainer.  The focal length is fairly limiting on a crop body camera, and you may not find much use for it.  And if you don't use it it's not a bargain, no matter how cheap it is.  A better choice might be the 35mm f/2, which is twice the cost but has been reviewed well.  It is close to a normal perspective after taking the crop into account.If you do like the 50mm focal range though, but don't want to shell out for the 50mm f/1.4, this lens is a great choice.  It is small and light, as well as sharp and fast.""
"20090101","5.0","Great for Full Frame","Pros:PriceImage QualityFocal length for Full FrameCompact and light.Cons:Vignetting wide open on a full frame.Terrible bokeh for specular highlights (like small reflections, etc)Plastic ConstructionNoisy FocusingWho should buy this lens?  Anyone with a Canon EOS camera capable of using EF lenses that doesn't already have an equivalent lens.  If you want the best bokeh, best image quality especially at the corners on full frame buy the new Sigma 50mm f/1.4.The reason I give this 5 stars is the balance of all the pros and cons.  For $85 US this is an unbeatable lens.  Sure, it has a plastic mount, manual requires flipping a switch, and a noisier micro-motor, but the images sure are sharp, the contrast is fine, and the focus is accurate.  The lens is compact and light which makes it a perfect travel lens for the 5D.My only cons is the extreme corners are nearly black on full frame at f/1.8, and if you are stepped down at all, any reflections or small specular highlights are pentagon shaped and rather distracting.  It seems to produce these easily too.  The plastic construction is cheap, but seems durable enough to me.  I haven't had any issue with mine.  The focus motor sounds squeaky and unpleasant, even next to other micro motor lenses.  Finally, the MF switch is small and hard to flip sometimes.But everything said, if you want a great value for a low light prime, this is the one.  For a general use lens it is better matched to a full frame camera than a crop camera, but it is still a great short telephoto for a crop camera.""

While the focal length is somewhat limiting when you don't have room to back up, or maybe you'd prefer a wider lens for landscape photos (making my next purchase the 35mm f/2), this lens more than exceeded my expectations and is an exceptional value! It especially shines during indoors photo shoots, for example, the basketball games where I take photos for my school's yearbook, or during concerts (given you're close eenough to the stage), the maximum aperture of f/1.8 is very helpful at freezing action without cranking up the noise.

The optics are just out of this world. Dont be fooled by its sub-$100 price tag. (I dont have the 50mm f/1.4) but this lens sure is the best bang for the buck lens out there. It produces razor sharp, crystal clear optics! Has awesome bokeh and a super narrow depth of field (which i love! I can take a pic of my doggy and only get its nose in focus while the rest of the picture is out of focus and bokeh). Though the build is plastic, it has a metal mount and is sturdy on the camera. It doesnt have USM either but focuses super fast and superquiet as if it was USM. Also, you can use FTM focus.

I was able to shoot complete tumbling passes without a lot of motion blur and still have enough light to actually see something without a lot of post processing.

Okay onto the quality of the 1.8I take a lot of family photos, as well more creative ones. This lens works great for family functions, gives a really good shallow depth of field (blur out backgrounds so the focus is on your subject). It's also very useful indoors or low light. Because it's so wide open (f/1.8) you can shoot at a faster shutter speed and eliminate unwanted blur or shake. I find myself using this lens more then the kit lens or my 75-300mm simply because the optical quality is better and the fact that its fixed at 50mm usually is not a problem.Pros-*Inexpensive :at $80 everyone should have one in their bag*Very wide aperture (f/1.8) : higher shutter speeds shallower depth of field*Optical quality :better then kit lens*small and light :doesn't add much in space or weight in your camera bag*fast focusing :auto focusing is fairly quickCons-*body build quality :plastic body, but does not change image taken*prime lens (50mm) :with cameras shooting 6-12mp+ you can crop the image""

For the price this lens delivers quality pictures and I would have to say in some cases it far exceeds what one would expect given the low price.  The only criticism I have from a capability standpoint is that it delivers rather soft pictures but acceptable nonetheless.  Most people who own a DSLR also have a computer and probably have some sort of editing software that will allow the sharpness to be adjusted somewhat so problem solved.  I use Lightroom 2 on all my photos to tweak them to their max potential.  I think this lens would be a great gift for anyone with a DSLR.""

"20081216","5.0","Great product shots","Several people told me to get this lens for product shots. Besides not needing to be far away for the shots this thing is GREAT! Brings in a lot of light and produces images better than any other lens's I have. I recomend it a lot!""
"20081216","5.0","Great Lens for the price","Great lens for the beginner photographer. Inexpensive investment. great portrait lens with great bokah.  Great in low light. a must-have for the amatuer photographers.""
"20081216","4.0","Great but very narrow","The shallow depth of field and low light capabilities of this lens are fantastic. I am having to adjust to the narrow angle of the lens.""
"20081214","5.0","Great little lens for the price","I've been using this lens for about a year now on my Rebel.  It is a fantastic lens for the price.  Belongs in every Cannon kit.  Pros are that it is fast and cheap.  Under the right conditions it produces really clear shots.  Cons are the AF is slow and often useless in low light.  While the lens is fast enough for many low light shots--the AF and manual through the view finder can be next to impossible.I've had lots of fun with this lens playing with depth of field in soft evening lighting conditions.  Also great for indoor shots of the kids where you can use a bounce flash.Considering the price, you can't go wrong with this lens.  Don't waste your time with other kit lens.  Spend a few hundred on a good zoom, and this lens too.""
"20081212","5.0","Good Value Lens","The large f/1.8 aperture allows me to take action photos indoors for a reasonable price. My daughters do gymnastics and as long as I get close to the action, I've been able to get some nice shots that would have been blurred with my other lenses. Certainly, there are better (very expensive) lenses, but since I only use it occasionally, it makes sense for me. I have no problem with the quality of the photos. It works with both an XTi and a 40D body with no issues.""
"20120226","4.0","Bokehlicious","I ordered this Lens from Amazon and it is great for Bokeh effects. It does not have a zoom so your legs are the zoom. The videos I take are really artisitic, it's an awesome lens to have.""
"20120225","5.0","Great Lens for beginners like me!","I purchased this 50mm 1.8 lens as my seconds lens for my cannon T2i.  The kit lens I opted for was the 18-55mm one and it is a great all around lens for me being a new entrant into the DSLR world.  The reason I purchased this particular lens was because of price, recommendations from professionals on youtube and websites, and the deeper depth of field I could achieve with it. The results I have yielded have been excellent! Compared to the kit lens, the pictures I take seem to be of a higher quality in the way of detail, and I am able to get a better blur of backgrounds when I am shooting.When considering which 55mm lens to purchase, the 1.2mm was completely out the question for me simply because it was twice the price of my T2i body and kit lens combined! Leaving me with this lens and the 1.4 option, I felt this would serve me a good for the price and my skill level. When doing research, I often found professionals said this lens had a cheap build quality. I can not comment to this being that the only two lenses I have used are entry level lenses; however, I can say that just being a human, I do not see this lens breaking unless I do something careless with it.So in conclusion, I think every new photographer should have a 55mm lens in their gear bag, I find it wonderful in portrait situations along with lower light situations when you need a higher aperture. Plus, for $100 you can not beat this one for the value it gives you! BUY THIS LENS!!""
"20120224","5.0","You get so much for so little money","I had attended a photography class last year where the instructor strongly suggested that our next lens purchase be a 50mm lens.  I had held off on the purchase for a while as most of the photos that I take are action photos where I need a telephoto / zoom lens.  The time came recently when I wanted a lens with more precision; one that I could use for still photos of my family and family events.  I have been using this lens now for about one month.As someone who has been accustomed to primarily using zoom lenses, I have found it a little bit difficult to adapt to this lens.  There is no zoom ring, the zoom is you actually walking forward or backward.  It's taken a while to get used to framing shots as I always find myself either too close or too far away.  Over time and with more experience, I would think that having a sense of proper distance will start to develop.The photos that I am able to capture with this lens are absolutely amazing.  Photos are tack sharp, the colors are true, and the bokeh that this lens produces is fantastic.  I have been using this lens to take team photos of my daughters' cheerleading teams and they have turned out great.  I have also used this lens to take photos of my kids playing in the park.  Since I can get the shutter speed up to 1/800 or 1/1000, capturing action shots of them on the swings or on a spinning ride come out perfectly.  The quick shutter speed also comes in handy for candid shots of the kids while they are sitting around the house playing with their toys, riding their bikes, etc.  I have really enjoyed playing around with depth of field with this lens; the ability to capture full backgrounds or blur the background depending upon where we are is great.I wish that I had gotten this lens sooner so that I could have been building my experience with the lens all of this time.  I now use this as my default lens and only use my telephoto / zoom lenses for sports.If you are on the fence about purchasing this lens, JUST BUY IT!!!  As of the time that I am writing this review, it is $119.00 which is the lowest priced Canon lens available.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this lens... you will be happy that you did.""
"20120223","5.0","Works great for low-light video","I got this because I frequently shoot video in low-light situations with my Canon 5D and needed a lens that could do the job.Well -- this one DOES, and then some.  I used it today to film some interviews in a dimly-lit meeting room and the results are beautiful.  It nicely achieved the coveted blurred-background look while my foreground subject looks clear & crisp.Not being able to zoom with this lens actually makes the filming easier.  Just set up the camera, position the subject and you're good to go.And I don't find this lens to feel as 'cheap' as some others on here have said.  It's well worth the price!""
"20120223","5.0","Love it!","I don't know too much about photography yet, so you can take this review with a grain of salt if you'd like, but I love this lens.  At first I thought I might be limited using it since it's a fixed focal length, but I was wrong. I just have to move my body rather than using the lens to zoom.  This thing works in so many lighting situations and it super versatile.  I'd highly recommend it, even for a novice like myself!""

Still a great lens for the price.Pros:Well worth the price.LightweightAwesome lens for 2.0 and up.Cons:Plastic mount (then again it's not your everyday lens.

"20120221","4.0","great lens use it till it pukes.","super cheap lens. but also sharp as a tack. everyone should start out with this lens as a step up from a kit lens. i had it for years first on a film canon 3. then on my first digital camera the canon 1d.  loved this on the 1.3 crop. works great on a 1.6 crop as well. i would recommend it to anyone needing a super sharp fast prime lens.  great for portraits i always wanted the 1.4 but this one was so good that i kept it until it puked.  it didnt actually puke i really dropped it with the weight of a 20d with a grip on it. landed right on the front of the lens right before a shoot to boot.  its a sharp lens sharp as an l zoom.  but not as solidly built as the original canon 1.8 but they are hard to find and are about 100 bucks more then the 50mm 1.8 ii.  i now have the 1.4 and i love it.  even sharper and stronger built. still not an l lens so i wouldnt want to drop it.  if you are paying for photography i would get this 1.8. if photography is paying you i would get the 1.4.""
"20120220","4.0","It was Grey Market","The lens is fine but the fact that it was grey market was not mentioned in the vendors description (not Amazon). F1.8 adds a new dimension to photography. This lens allows exploring the pluses and minuses of a prime lens at a low cost.""
"20081212","4.0","Works well for the price.","I knew when I bought this lens, it wasn't the best 50mm out there. But for the price, I'm very pleased with the photos I'm getting. It works very well inside in low light situations. And the photos outside have been good, as well.The only thing that really bothers me, and the reason for 4 stars, is the noise the lens makes when focusing. It's not horrible, but it is annoying.I'd recommend this lens to my friends. It's cheap, but it gets the job done.""
"20081212","5.0","Great bang for the buck!","The 50mm f/1.8 is the first prime lens I ever bought.  Paid $75 for it and it's been one of the best lens investments for me.  It's perhaps the sharpest lens I own, and small and lightweight for easy carrying.Yes, its plastic build is cheap, but come on, folks, you're paying $75 for this thing.  What do you expect?  As long as you take care of your equipment, this lens should last you a while.  It has for me.The only negative to me that really sticks out is it's a bit noisy when focusing.  But for the type of photography I do, it's not a big deal.This is a great lens for any amateur photographer, especially someone who is new to shooting with a prime lens.  I've had it for a few years now and in terms of bang for the buck, the 50mm f/1.8 is a great value!""
"20081212","5.0","Smokin 50","I bought this on a recommendation of another photographer as an inexpensive smokin deal.  It's light, fast, accurate and low-profile.

"20081207","4.0","Useful f/1.8, Good Value","This lens is very useful due to its 1.8 aperture, capturing lots of light.  I do find myself standing further away to capture the scene than I would with my 18-55mm.  Great value!""
"20081206","5.0","Make this your first lens purchase","What else can I say that hasn't been said. This is great lens for a great price. The only negative is that the casing is plastic, but what do you expect for under a hundred dollars. On a 1.6 factor camera this is a perfect portrait lens. The brokeh is very good and the sharpness is amazing. Unless you are a professional this should be in your lens bag.""
"20081206","5.0","Exceeded my expectations","To be honest, at first I wanted to give 4.5 stars. The half star off for the lens using 52mm filters rather than 58mm that match my existing lenses, and because it is a plastic that seems a bit flimsy. What I found though is the lens is not flimsy, it is fairly substantial and the plastic does cut the overall camera weight down when in use. As far as having to purchase an additional set of filters and a hood - it is worth it. This relatively inexpensive lens provides a good entry into lower light photography. Once you use it at night or inside a dimly lit building the value is readily apparent. The shots are clear and sharp, and really what more could you ask for in a lens? Comparing the picture between this lens and the more expensive f/1.4 lens gives a result that is hard to distinguish. Sure the f/1.4 will be the better choice for those low light situations, but at over triple the cost?  I think for most users, the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens is a valuable addition. It performs in excess of what you would expect - for what it costs. Maybe 4 and three quarters stars...""
"20081204","5.0","Great for portraits","I've owned this lens for just over a year now.  My other lens is a 17-85mm, and while I use that one when I go outdoors and/or want a wider range, I keep the 50mm on my camera about 90% of the time.  These days I'm mostly taking pictures of my 10month old son, and this lens is fabulous for that.  Allows me to take great clear, crisp shots indoors with low-ish light.  I'll agree it might not be as nice as the 1.4, but for 1/3 the price that's to be expected.  If you can afford to go higher, then sure, buy the 1.4 or another more expensive lens.  But if you're strapped for cash and want/need a great lens for portraits and close-ups, this is the lens for you.""
"20081204","4.0","Pleasantly surprised","I was a bit apprehensive given the quality remarks, but with all the glowing reviews I bought. I took the lens along on a recent vacation and found that I was using it for most of my shots based on the great results. I keep it protected when not in use, no big deal. The camera feels kinda of weird with such a short lens but the shots speak for themselves.""
"20081203","5.0","much better than the stock camera lens","Let me start by saying that I'm a completely new to digital slr photography. That being said even for someone like me the difference between a stock lens that you get with the digital rebel vs this lens is quite noticeable. You don't need to be a pro to appreciate this lens.I did a very simple set of tests that involved mounting the camera on a tripod and taking multiple pictures of the same item (a toolbox) with both the stock 18-55mm lens and the 50mm prime lens. I set the focal length to 50mm and I changed the ISO settings from 100 all the way to 1600 for each lens with the same 5.6 aperture settings. Then I compared the photos side by side. Even fully zoomed out I could see the difference in the photos though someone just glancing at the photo may not. When zooming in the difference became much more apparent. Every picture with the 50mm prime lens was superior in clarity. The detail was much better.So, if you are looking for an inexpensive, high quality lens to buy with this camera and aren't ready to spend lots of money get this lens.  It's easily worth the price.""
"20081202","5.0","Noisy, loud, but for $85, I'm not going to complain.","Yes, its noisy, loud, and sometimes slow. But for a f1.8 aperture, for being lightweight, its worth $85 for sure. Great for a beginner photographer like I am to use this to try different shots with a prime lens. As others have noted, construction is plastic, but if I break it, drop it, or whatever, I won't be heartbroken.""

Without USM and with a plastic body, it just feels a little less quality, but that's what you get for the price.The low f-stop is nice and gives you a lot more flexibility that you could get without it, just know that if you buy this lens and like it, you're very likely to purchase an upgrade down the road, so if you want to save some money, you may want to pick up the f/1.4 now :)I wrote more details about this lens here:http://blogs.adamparkerphotography.com/blog/Canon-EF-50mm-f-1.8-mk-II-Lens-Review/14/""

Probably not the most durable, but still (even though price has gone up 15 bucks) about the best deal on the internet. 1.8 provides nice BG softness, and on my 40D it seems to have great corner to corner sharpness at most f-stops and I have had no auto-focus issues. Nice color, low CA; for the price, I don't think an EOS could find a better lens. I also shoot with the EF 28-135 IS and the EF 16-35L (though the latter is an intermittent loaner from a very kind friend.)This is obviously not the EF 1.4 or the EF 1.2, but it's also 1/4 to 1/12 of the price, and much more portable. The only minor 'drawback' is that the 'hood' supplied by canon is actually a catch all for smaller lens fronts, though they sell it as a dedicated hood, a bit of a price-gouge on that. You can buy a third party hood and get equally good results.""
"20081124","2.0","Smashed on impact....","I am only an amateur photographer, but I thought the picture quality, ease of use, and versatility of this lens was terrific for the cost of the lens. Recently, however, I had the misfortune of having my Canon 40D - with this lens attached- fall out of my camera backpack, and the lens completely disintegrated on impact. (The camera fell from a distance of @1.5'). This wouldn't have been so terrible if not for the fact that not only did the lens housing shatter into pieces, but the lens mount bent and the lens could not be removed, making the camera completely inoperable for that day's picture taking. I had to take the whole setup to a Canon repair site in NJ, since the camera had to be taken apart to remove the damaged lens. (Luckily, the Canon 40D survived the fall.) Obviously camera lenses were not designed to be dropped on asphalt, but accidents will happen, and had the lens had a sturdier housing, I don't think the mount would have bent so easily. I've had other Canon lenses survive worse falls than this and still function.""

The lens casing does, of course, feel cheap and when focusing is slightly louder than a normal lens, but the pictures come out crisp and have good color saturation. I recently used this lens to shoot a preschool graduation in a darkened auditorium, and the pictures came out fantastic. I'd definitely reccommend this lens.***EDIT 04/27/2012** I've had this lens for 4 years now, and I still love it. I now use it with my Canon 7D. In fact, the price has RISEN $20-30 since I got it! What a great resell value! I have learned more about photography, and if you are using a crop sensor camera this is more like an 80mm lens, so you do have to be farther away from subjects than other lenses. For the price though, it can't be beat. I use this lens with low light indoors to take photos of my 6 month old son, and have gotten some amazing results so far.""

If you can't take perfect care of your lens, save up for the mk1, which is about $300 more, made of metal, and is f/1.4.

The body is more fragile than the metal-body version, but that one is $250 more. If you are careful with it and/or keep it on the camera everything will be fine. If you drop it or twist it on and off in a hurry, I'm sure it will eventually get damaged. It is wonderful in low light...gyms, churches, auditoriums, etc. Is only $80 with a free UV filter, yet it will be one of the best and most used lenses in your bag.""
"20081115","3.0","Excellent optical performance from a disposable lens","The first time I used this lens was on an EOS 1n, shooting Ilford HP5+ black and white film.  I processed the film in the same tank as other Ilford film shot with a Leica M6 and a Summicron 50/2 lens.  After the film dried and I viewed it with a loupe, I really couldn't see much difference between the two.  The Canon was selling for about $75 at the time.  The Leica lens was bought used for about $600.While that is impressive optical performance, the EF lens is not so great in actual use.  There is no distance scale--forget hyperfocal distance.  (If you don't know what that is, you probably should read up on photography.)  If you should ever need manual focus, such as when using hyperfocal distance or the lens is on extension tubes and autofocus is a PIA to use, there is a rudimentary ring but it offers zero damping and feels like turning a loose bottlecap.  It's also cheap-feeling plastic from front to back, including the mount, making it very lightweight but also fairly fragile.  Quite a few people report this lens being disabled with minor bumps.I haven't used this lens in some time.  I have an EF 50/1.4 that has good optical performance AND has operational features and build quality that are miles ahead of the f/1.8 model.  I keep the cheaper lens around as a spare.You will be well-served by this lens if you accept the limitations.  Consider it disposable.""

"20081109","5.0","Superb optics in crappy plastic box","I have been using the EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens for almost 2 years now. Bought for about $70 from JR. As many reviewers have stated, plastic case is cheap, focusing ring is obscure and it may not survive a drop from couple of feet on to a hard surface, but it does take super sharp pictures. On a cropped sensor camera like Digital Rebel or 40D, the 50mm is great for portraits. I compared it with $1000 EF 24-105 L at 50mm @ f/4. This lens is the winner(agree this is a prime and the other is a zoom, still it's an L). If you can handle it gently and carefully, you should own one. It is the 'best value for money' item in my kit.""
"20081107","4.0","Amateur DSLR owners would be silly not to own this lens","Every DSLR owner should own at least one prime lens with a wide aperature.  For amateurs, the 1.8 is the obvious choice.  This lens is too inexpensive--and too good--for amateur DSLR owners not to own a copy.Obviously, it doesn't have a zoom, so it's not a good landscape or telephoto lens--you probably wouldn't rely on it at a sporting event, the Grand Canyon, or the zoo.  Still, it's the lens that is on my XTi most of the time.  I'm definitely an amateur, and I primarily take pictures of my family and friends at various events or around the house.  Its portraiture capability is great, and with the large aperatures you can really get creative.  The 50mm is great in low light too if--if--you have enough contrast for the lens to lock in on focus.  Otherwise, the lens has a tendency to hunt.  As long as you aren't shooting in pitch black and can find a contrast point to lock on to, you won't have a big problem.I've also found that my lens has a slight accuracy problem at higher aperatures.  It's not a big deal, but you definitely get a little 'dreamy' effect at f/1.8 if you're not careful.  But the depth of field is so narrow, that it's probably partly user error, too.As for the build quality, this seems to be the biggest knock against the 1.8.  I don't think it's as bad as some people say.  If you're content with the build quality of the kit lens on the digital rebels, which also have plastic mounts, you'll be fine with the build quality of this 50mm.Is it better than the Canon 50mm F/1.4 or F/1.2L? Clearly, it's not.  But some people would never spend so much money for a prime, anyway.  The 50mm f/1.8 is for those people.

If you can afford it, though, get the 50mm f/1.4.  the images from the 1.4 are slightly better, but the thing that really sets it apart is the focusing.  the 1.4 has USM focusing while this one does not.  this lens takes forever to focus in low light and intense light.  sometimes I can't get it to lock on at all and I have to manual focus.  even then some times I can't get it to confirm that I'm in focus.""

Second time I went to use it on the shooting assignment - the same thing happened. I would work for a while, and then go into ERR99 freeze, I would have to turn the camera off, then back on to get few more shots, till it happens again.

"20081024","3.0","Not a very good lens.","I am going to be frank. the AF misses most of the time, and produces soft photographs. Sometimes the lens quite Autofocusing for some reason. When you press the button half way it makes a little noise, nudges a little, and stops. The lens is pretty soft wide-open, closing down to f/2.8 makes the images much sharper. It's not extremely soft, but it's not the sharpest. A plastic mount/body is not very desirable in the world of SLR photography, but for $90, you are definitely compromising key features. For the price, it's a great lens. However, in general it's not a great lens. If you are on a tight budget, and do not have semi-professional expectations, this would be a great lens for you. You get a lot more back for your buck with the f/1.4 version. A USM motor, faster in low light ( and sharper ), and better build are the main advantages with the f/1.4. For the money it's not bad.""

"20081014","5.0","What build quality?? Nothing beats this lens at this price.","I have owned this lens for only 3 days yet... and this is my second DSLR lens to the Canon 28-105mm USM one.Regardless, I can already see the difference in image quality when I compare the two. This lens is far better in sharpness and color rendition at an equivalent focal length. It is amazingly sharp around 2.8f.I wish I had bought this one in the first place... and then I wont have bought the 28-105 one so soon.To sum up:Pros:- A great lens for starters.- Very sharp around f2.8, sharp even otherwise.- Very good for low light conditions.- Light weight, not bulky in size.- Vibrant colors.Cons:- Auto focus isnt very handy.. and struggles sometimes in low light conditions. But thats expected I think.- Focussing is noisy.. no ultrasonic gizmos in there.- Manual focus wil need some skills... the grip threads arent very easily grip-pable.In the end, I would actually cross off all the cons from the list considering the price you pay for it: a sub-100 bucks lens that gives excellent image quality. People who complain about the build quality probably care more about a solid body than about the end result: image quality.. and will be happy to pay 10 times for a lens that isnt as sharp... so let them pay the extra bucks if they can. I speak from personal experience since I paid about 4 times as much for a USM lens and this one still beats the expensive one by a long margin!!Recommendation: I highly recommend this lens as a starter lens. I would in fact advise you to get this one instead of the crappy kit lenses that no one would buy otherwise.""

Wow.  For $89.00, this is one great lens.This thing is light plastic.  It seriously feels like a kids toy lens.  It has zero heft to it, and is cheap, black, super-light plastic.  It is so convenient and light that I often put it on my 5d and use it as a walk-around lens.  I also have shot some portraits with it.  It is very sharp, and has nice Bokeh when wide open.  And, at F/1.8 - it is FAST compared to any zoom lens.My only beef is its lack of USM autofocus with full-time manual capability - but I have no right to complain - for the money, it is absolutely great as is.  I'm just spoiled from using my USM L glass.My main lens is my 24-70 F/2.8 L USM...it is a tack-sharp awesome piece of engineering, and my favorite lens of all time, but it is over $1200 and it weighs a ton (See my Amazon review).  Sometimes it is nice just to put this little guy on and forget the camera is around my neck...like when hiking, etc., or when I want to fit my camera into a small bag.I'll eventually step up to the F/1.4 with USM at just shy of four bills if I break this little cheapie.  Until then, I am enjoying its excellent photos.If you have an extra body laying around, and you have a kid that wants to learn to shoot, stap one of these on there and let them fire away.Really, for the money, this little lens cannot be beat.

"20080924","1.0","Catastrophic breakage after only the 2d shot!","Ok, so I should have listened to the other reviews that talk about this being a cheap lens, but now MY 40D NEEDS 200$ IN REPAIRS because the rear lens of the 50mm broke loose and lodged itself in the mirror box.I received the lens from Amazon and it appeared to be in good shape when I placed it on my 40D body. However, when autofocusing (only the 2d shot) it made this really loud motor sound and the front lens assembly SHOT OFF about a foot!! Some plastic pieces were broken on the front lens assembly (inside) so it must've been fairly significant force. Anyways, the kicker is that I CAN'T get the lens off the body....it's stuck.Canon says they don't cover this under their warranty. The Tech at the Canon service shop says 'there are signs of impact', implying it was dropped, which it wasn't! So, to get this fixed I am going to have to fork out 200$'s!!!! I could've just bought the f/1.4! Unbelievable. Don't, I repeat, DON'T BUY THIS LENS!!.....it's not worth the risk. Absolute junk.Follow up (9/24/2008): Canon finally said they will do a 'courtesy repair' on the camera body since it is only a few months old....but I'll be waiting for a few weeks to get it back. Still doesn't change my opinion about the lens (buyer beware).""
"20080920","5.0","Slow down and think","I bought the Canon EF 50mm as an exercise in 'getting back to basics'. Because it lacks any zoom, it forces me to think through compositions and what I'm doing. The up side of digital photography is that it doesn't cost any more to take another shot (as it did with film). The down side is that digital photography encourages the AK-47 approach to shooting ... shoot a lot and look for the pictures later. The consequence is that I noticed my 'keeper' ratio dropped significantly. A prime lens is my counter-measure because it slows me down and forces me to examine a photo opportunity from a number of angles ... moving myself to find different angles rather than zooming through the possibilities.The optics are crisp and simple compared to tons of glass grouped to accommodate multiple focal lengths. F/1.8 is quite fast, yielding more latitude in low light situations. Canon makes an f1.4 50mm with a metal housing (rather than the f/1.8's plastic construction) that is marginally better but at between 3 and 4 times the cost with a minimal gain in lens speed. In that I don't do combat photography, I anticipate the plastic construction will work out just fine.Auto-focus is Canon quiet - I have a couple Tamron lenses who's auto-focus sounds like a rather large truck shifted into reverse by comparison.If you're looking for a good prime lens at a very affordable price, the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 is a great bargain - but keep in mind that with the 'less than full frame' dig-it-all cameras, it functions like a 80mm telephoto ... a really great portrait lens.""

"20080903","5.0","Best Value Of Any Lens, Period.","This lens is hands down the best value of any lens you will ever buy.  It's the perfect focal length for most portraiture, with either full frame cameras, or APS-C cameras that use the 1.5/1.6 multiplier, making this effectively a 75/85mm lens.  The f/1.8 max aperture is so much fun to play with, and a great way to learn about Depth of Field.  It makes it hard not to take EVERY photo at that fast aperture.  The SINGLE tick mark against the lens I have is it's focus is not 100% perfect - sometimes I get images that are ever so slighty out of focus.  But it's an $80, $90 lens, so I can't even count that against it, so much so that I gave it the full 5 stars.  If I could give 1/2 star increments, I would have given it 4.5, but forced to choose, I like it enough that it earned the full 5 stars.

"20080829","5.0","Great lens for portraiture","There are several aspects of this lens that I love and really only one that I don't like - I've shared my views of the cons and pros below:Pros --The lens is extremely quick with a maximum f-number of 1.8 this allows for the use of very fast shutter speeds under lower ISO (meaning lower noise) conditions.  Another primary advantage of this is that the large aperture creates a very shallow depth of field - a desirable quality for portraits.  This is also a great advantage for anyone that wants to shot their kids  or pets playing around in their backyard.  Note that canon does make a 'big brother' for this lens in the form of the 50mm f/1.4 USM (USM indicates the incorporation of Canon's ultra sonic motor).-The sharpness on the lens is great even when shooting wide open, especially since the lens costs under 100 dollars.  Sure it's not an L lens but it's also not 1000 dollars.-The cost in general is very nice, you're not going to find another lens of this quality at the 100 dollar price point.-Weight - the lens weighs very little and isn't very long which is nice because it won't be straining you.Cons --As several other reviewers have noted, the build quality on the lens seems sub-par.  The body is made out of plastic and it feels cheap.  However, if you take care of your lens, especially when removing it from and mounting it to your camera, you'll be fine.  But don't expect this lens to be able to take a beating because it won't be able to.""
"20080826","5.0","One of the first lenses you should add.","Yes. It really is an awesome lens. I have moved up to an intermediate photography for-hire level because of the work this lens has allowed me to accomplish. I have read books and reviews recommending this lens. Everyone said the same: that it is a fast, crisp glass, giving a pro appearance. So I bought one.Right away, I could tell the difference from the basic lens that came with my Canon EOS XTi. I could finally shoot indoors on 'A' without camera shake. What I didn't expect was the difference between my favorite travel lens the Canon EF-S 28-135 Zoom and the 50mm. Although the glass on my travel lens is great, the glass on this sub-hundred dollar lens was better. I mean better by 'more depth.'True, it is a composite housing, but for under a hundred bucks don't listen to feedback that complains that the quality is not good.Using this lens has given me more confidence to get the money shot. Use it for fast portrait shots. Because it is a prime lens, you will find yourself moving around a bit more.  The reward is a beautiful, professional looking shots.""

I am still learning the ins and outs of shooting with a DSLR and this lens makes my shots look like a pro.

"20120220","5.0","You can't beat it for the price","Yes, this lens is fairly light weight, and it probably won't last as long as the $400+ version. But, for the price, you're not losing out on image quality. This lens is one of the best buys you will ever make. If you are a pro, you may want to spring for the extra $300 and get the higher quality lens, but for someone who is still learning, like me, you absolutely don't need the more expensive lens.The image quality is excellent, and has transformed my photography. You will immediately notice a difference compared to the kit lenses (T2i). Of course, it's a prime lens, so not as flexible. But, I still seem to keep this lens on far more often than the zoom lenses that came with my camera. And if you like Bokeh, I was able to achieve some amazing results with this lens.Got it for $109, and it was worth every penny. Some day if I am making money off of photography, it may justify the more expensive lens, but until then, especially if you are not a pro yet, this is one of the best lenses you will ever get.""

I have my own photography business, and I've used this lens twice since I received it, and it's amazing. The pictures came out just like I wanted them, w/ a very shallow depth of field. I used it for an engagement session as well as a senior(graduating, not elderly lol) session, and I couldn't be happier.""

"20120217","5.0","Man just buy it!","Forget the plastic mount, the plastic construction, the fact that it's not USM, etc...  This little thing is AMAZING!!!  I own the Tamron 17-50mm f2.8, and even though I like the focal length of that lens (and also the fact that it has a constant f2.8 aperture), I always find myself increasing the sharpness of my photos a little bit in post processing.  With the Canon 50mm 1.8 I don't have to do that.  This thing is RAZON SHARP and for $100+ dollars, you can't beat that.I was a little worried (before I bought it) about the focal lenght.  I thought because of the cropped sensor in my Canon T2i, the lens was going to be too close to use in close quarters, or that I would have to stand 50 feet away from my subject, etc...  Boy I was wrong, this lens is just perfect.  GET IT, YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED!!!""
"20120216","5.0","Super Sharp","I owned only the kit lens and a 55-250 IS lens. This is WAY sharper than those lenses with much better bokeh. It is perfect for low light shooting, as well as shooting throughout the day. This is my new favorite lens, and for the price... It is untouchable!""
"20120214","4.0","Cheap and Sharp, 4/5","This thing is not totally sharp wide open, and experiences a bit of coma. Multiple tests of shooting stars at night revealed this. When I shoot during the day @ f1.8, I don't notice the flaws. Once you get to f4, the performance is much better. So many guys who shoot astrophotography avoid shooting at f1.8, and shoot at f4. I personally shoot between the two to capture more light.This lens is very cheap. Maybe the cheapest feeling lens I have ever handled. It is very light as well. The focus ring is tiny, and not suited for MF. Despite this, I still shoot video and photos in manual focus mode. The AF is loud. Be careful with what type of lens hood you use on this lens. A stiff hood might break the lens if you drop it or something. I would suggest using something that would absorb shock, like a rubber hood.This lens might have the highest sharpness/cost ratio out of all the lenses that are being sold right now. A great added bonus is that it can shoot at 1.8, and provide decent images, unlike most cheap 'fast' lenses.Personally, I think I will upgrade to the canon 1.4 soon, but keep the 1.8 as a back up to use on a secondary body. The 1.4 is also a fairly cheap construction and provides comparable sharpness. The 1.4 has several advantages: nicer looking bokeh, a better focusing ring, more light grasp. Since I shoot video, the focus ring is a big deal for me.My bro has an 18-55IS and a 55-250IS that he recently got. I have shot with them a bit and would skip the 18-55is. It is a fine lens for the money, but I think you are better off saving up for a sigma 10-20 or a samyang (aka rokinon) 14mm and combining that w/ a 50mm 1.8. The 55-250 is quite impressive because it is small and the IS at the long end allows for great sharpness handheld. So if you are debating between which 1st lens to buy, I would say: 1. 50mm, 2. 55-250is, 3. 18-55mm is. The 18-55mm is only useful if you really want the 18-35mm range for cheap. If that range is not critical for you, buying the 18-55mm given the superior optics of the 50mm 1.8 would not make sense.If you scroll to the second page of images, you can see a shot that I took of the andromeda galaxy. The only reason I rate this lens 4/5 stars is because the focusing ring is a joke. I don't understand why they could not improve it just a tadd, and sell the lens for and extra $20.""

As many of you know photography can be an expensive hobby/art and college prices are rising. So what to do? Research lenses, save up money, and hope you aren't disappointed. This lens did not disappoint. I was skeptical at first thinking that an inexpensive lens would mean terrible quality, unreliable build, and overall crappy pictures. BUT, on the advice of a friend I spent the small amount. I haven't taken the lens off my camera since. You will not find a higher clarity lens for this amount of money. I recommend it to everyone. This lens will always hold a special place in my heart because with it I discovered what the art of photography really is. Unfortunately now I am looking for a zoom lens with the same quality (I have been spoiled with this one) and the prices are outrageous. So buy the 50mm. Everyone should own one.""

Let me tell you that I have not been disappointed and neither will you when you see the great pictures that you will be taking with this lens. Note that the lens may appear inexpensive, but if you take good care of it, as I know most photo lovers do their equipment, it should last you a long time. Good luck and great 'clicking'""
"20080711","4.0","Thanks to Canon for such good price","Amazingly sharp and an outstanding f-stop. It feels like somewhat plastic but don't let the looks and the price mislead you. I shot pictures with this lens on using my new 40D one late afternoon. Results were astonishing! I have never had such sharp images with Canon 24-85mm zoom. If you own a Canon, you must buy this lens and use it. Fight the temptation to use a zoom for the time being. You will appreciate the light weight and the sharpness, as well as the brightness (F1.8).Remember, a fixed focal-length lens has MUCH LESS COMPLICATED optical elements than a zoom, therefore SHARPER & LIGHTER by nature. Many great sreet photographers of our time did not use a zoom. In fact, when I was a photography major in college in early 70s, I did not even dream of using a zoom. A zoom lens was for amateurs with dough, never for serious photography students.A sharp lens at less than $90? I believe this is one way for Canon to say 'Thanks' to their camera buyers.""

"20080710","5.0","Worth the money","This little lens is worth its weight in gold.  With a f stop of 1.8 you can really do some fun shots that just cannot be done on other lenses.  The focal length is great for portraits as well as landscapes and is a good all around lenses if you are looking to empty out your camera bag a little big.  This lens is not a rugged as other canon lenses, I know because this one is my second, but at this price if you drop it and break the motor, not a good day for me, you can easily replace it compared to the 1.4 or 1.2 models that canon produces.  I think this lens is a must for any photographer who enjoys experimenting with portraits or other small depth of field applications.""
"20080707","5.0","The BEST First lens you can buy","As far as your first lens, this is the best choice.  With an aperture of 1.8 you'll be able to take low light shots with a lot of success.  This lens is very sharp, so if your shots look blurry it's probably you, not the lens.  The focal length may seem a little narrow.  However, you'll quickly learn what your next lens should be.  Do you want to be closer to the action?  Get a longer lens.  Do you find yourself backing up?  Get a wide angle.While this lens will not be the last one you buy, it should be your first.  In my opinion, it's the best training lens.""

I am starting to get tempted to upgrade to something a little higher quality (50mm 1.4) or wider (35 mm f/2), but I have to say that this lens helped me become a better photographer.

If you only have the 18-55 kit lens, this is definitely your next lens unless you can throw down a lot more cash.Pros:Once you get to about f/2.8 this thing gets pretty darned sharp.  The sweet-spot seems to be around f/4.0 to f/4.5 on my XTi which is where it is sharpest.No noticeable chromatic aberration.  Of course being a prime, we all should hope so.Cons:Everything else that makes a lens a lens is what this fails at.It's hopelessly soft wide open.  The bokeh is nasty looking.  Color saturation isn't so hot.  It gets softer towards the edges.  In low light, auto-focus will 'hunt' far more often than it should.  I can deal with all those issues.  What really makes this a bad lens is the auto-focus miss issue.Focus will too often land just in front of your subject meaning that you're going to just toss the picture in the trash.  Given that it tempts you to use a thin depth of focus, this will happen a lot.  If you can get a good in-focus shot then all the other issues will melt away and you'll be in awe of what a great shot you can get from this thing given the number of dollars this item commands.""

I used it for a portrait shoot in March and it worked great.  Had a wedding a week following.  Used it for about an hour at the wedding and all of a sudden while focusing the inner mechanics completely came apart from the plastic casing and popped out.  I sent it in to be repaired and was charged $40+tax for the repair.Received the lens back in April.  Immediately took it out of its box, put it back on my XTi and took a few test pictures.  Seemed to be ok.  Placed the unit in my bag.  Fast-forward 2 weeks.  I went to do some more portraits.  Took the camera out of my bag, snapped 3 pictures and POP.  SAME PROBLEM AGAIN.  While focusing (auto) it popped out of the casing again.I sent it back to Canon under their 3 month repair warranty.  They insisted that I pay the $40 repair charge AGAIN.  I told them there was no way - it is showing obviously that it either wasn't repaired correctly or its a lemon.  After going back and forth over the phone they finally agreed to waive the charge due to their 'one time courtesy.'  I'm sorry but there was no courtesy there.  They kept accusing me of dropping the lens, abusing it, etc.I regret from DAY ONE that I purchased this lens instead of the 1.4.  I cannot trust this lens for any of my portrait shoots anymore (once I receive it back).  I should have told Canon to destroy the lens.I have learned my lesson the hard way.  If the lens price seems too good to be true - it probably is.  Stick with metal and go with the 1.4.

I put my ISO to 1600 and my speed ranges from  300 to 400. The only thing I wished is that I could have found a wider angle lens like a 35mm with the same f-stop because sometime 50mm is too much""
"20080609","5.0","what a great investment","I think buying this lens is one of the best investments I've made. It is very reasonably priced and a great product!!""
"20080608","5.0","Worth every penny....and almost costs pennies","You simply can't go wrong with this lens.  It is fast and sharp and the price is unbeatable.  It is difficult to use indoors on a digital SLR for much else then portraiture, but that is expected with the 1.6X multiplier.""
"20080607","4.0","Can't be more happy...","Can't be more happy with this lens.Pros:- Fast F1.8, takes clean and crisp pictures. Great for portraits.- Focusing is spot on. Takes good pictures in low light (because of high f/stop)- Is built well enough, nothing to complain about.- Is economic making it a good investment for beginners.Cons:- Focal length 50mm: on a D-SLR with crop 1.6 focal length is actually 80mm (crop 1.5 = 75mm), you really have to step back when taking pictures indoors, otherwise be prepared to crop someones head or feet off :)- is a little noisy, but that can be ignored when compared to the pictures it produces. And it is not USM, it is a regular 50mm lens.Overall, this lens is great for the price and I would recommend this over the kit lens for beginners.Update:This is not a replacement for the Kit Lens, but a great lens to begin with. I added the Tamron 17-50mm lens as a replacement to the Kit lens.""
"20080606","5.0","no better value for beginners","My initial impressions are wonderful.  For the price, you cannot buy a better lens.  The much hailed 50mm prime is a great alternative (esp. for dSLR beginners) to the kit zoom lenses that ship with many camera bodies.  This particular lens is nice and fast, lightweight, has great depth of field, and produces some sharp images.I'll go ahead and echo nearly every review of this lens that I've read: (1) the build quality is a bit cheap (plastic and all) but what do you expect for this price point? (2) it's a little slow to auto-focus when the contrast is poor or the light is low and (3) but if this lens were to break or get stolen, I would replace it immediately with another one of the same.""
"20080605","5.0","Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II","Probably the best buy in the DSLR/SLR world. The plastic housing feels a bit like a toy, but the glass says otherwise.  A tiny, extremely sharp lens that is absolutely unbeatable for the price.  A useful focal length that is perfect as a low-light head-and-shoulders/portrait lens (especially on an XT/XTi/XSi or 30d/40d, since the crop factor effectively makes it an 80mm lens).  Between this and my EF-S 17-85mm IS I hardly ever have to use the flash. Unless you've got money to burn on the 50mm f/1.4 ($330), f/1.2 ($1300), or f/1.0 (discontinued, ~$3000), buy this lens and don't look back.""
"20080605","4.0","I really like mine","I love this lens. Its made of plastic, including the mount- BUT, its a low cost lens. It has excellent depth of field, autofocus works good, and you can't go wrong with a large aperture if you want fast shutter speed. By the way, if you are planning to put this on a rebel xti it will function more like a 70mm lens...""
"20080604","4.0","Buy for the price, keep for the quality","The canon 50mm 1.8 is probably the greatest deal you'll come upon in the world of digital photography.  Priced at under $100 and coming with a 1.8 aperture, this lens can produce truly outstanding photo's for a truly outstanding price.This is a particularly good deal for people just starting in photography, as it allows them the opportunity to experiment with such a large aperture, thereby giving them a chance to play with bokeh (intentional background blur), lowlight photography, etc.The 50mm, as a prime lens, is also a good teaching tool. Due to the fact that it has no zoom you will, as a photographer, find yourself moving around more and setting up your shots more carefully.The downsides of this particular lens are that the build is a bit cheap (though, this is mainly why it's available for the price it is) and the AF has its moments of difficulty in certain lowlight situations (which can easily mended by either going into Manual Focus, or switching to a predetermined focal point, rather than the lens having to decide from the 7-9 points where the greatest amount of contrast lies)I have personally found this lens to be ideal when matched with an inexpensive zoom lens and the 18-55 kit lens. Why? because the 18-55 kit gives you some relatively good wide angle, the 50mm 1.8 gives you the 1.8 aperture and the telephoto gives you the zoom.  This setup has you prepared for just about any daytime activity and about all your missing is a telephoto with a wide aperture for indoor sports.End result, the 50mm 1.8 gives you great quality for a great price and while there are better, more expensive alternatives, this particular lens is a great way to get your feet wet.""
"20080603","5.0","Great for under a hundred bucks!","Great portrait lens - f1.8 makes it great for shooting indoors, at social events, etc.pair it with a good flash (like the 430ex or better) for great results!""
"20080601","5.0","Great Starter Lens, with a Caveat","I recently bought the Rebel XTi, and decided to follow prevailing wisdom by abandoning the kit lens.  I bought this lens instead, and have been very happy with the results.  If you are just starting out with photography (like me), you will be incredibly happy with the results.  I get crystal clear images, amazing bokeh (esp. when the aperture is at its widest), and beautiful vivid colors.The caveat is that on the XTi, the EF 50mm f/1.8 II is an excellent *portrait* lens.  The XTi does not have a full-frame sensor; rather, its sensor effectively crops the shot at a factor of 1.6.  That means that with the 50mm focal length, what you are really getting is an 80 mm perspective, which falls into the telephoto range.  This means that this lens is a less than ideal 'walking around' lens when used with crop-format bodies like the XTi.  By no means does this fact reduce the value of this lens, but if you aren't aware of this from the beginning it can be a little frustrating at first.  I plan on getting a lens with a shorter focal length, preferably short enough to actually give me a wide-angle perspective on the XTi body (~17mm).  If you really want to use the XTi for everyday walkaround shots, you might have to make do with the kit lens, or pay more for a good lens with a wider perspective.That being said, I *love* this lens.  My portrait shots are amazing, with beautiful bokeh, extremely crisp, etc.  Even the landscapes do not exactly suffer; it is simply a matter of finding the right POV.  To sum it up, I definitely have no regrets with this lens - just wisdom that I would like to share :)""
"20080601","5.0","Nice low light lens!","I use this lens mostly for low light situations and it does the job well. The only drawback that I have found is that I have to get used to the fact that it isn't a zoom or wide angle lens and it forces me to be a bit more creative in my shots (not a bad thing!). Obviously not a good lens for tight or close-in situations where you have no room to back up to fully frame your subject.""
"20080531","5.0","Must have lens!","This Canon lens is a must have for any beginning or more serious amateur photographer.  While not quite as fast as the 50mm F 1.4 or the incredible 50mm F 1.2L, it is a fast lens for less than $100.  This will allow you to shoot in low light conditions without flash and get great results.  Being less than $100 and being an EF lens means that you can buy it and use it forever, even if you move up to a full frame camera like the 5D.  I would highly recommend this lens.""
"20080530","4.0","Great Lens for the price","This lens is not perfect, but for under $100, what do you expect?  The images are good, & the lens is lightweight.  The build is cheap, the focus is slow, and it takes a while to get used to the difference if you are used to using a zoom.  The 1.8 is great for low light, and the shallow depth of field and bokah are wonderful to play with. I will be moving up to the 1.4 version as soon as I have the money though.""

It's a problem because I'd gotten so used to using this lens it became my default.

"20080527","5.0","Nifty-fifty...","I got exactly what I saw when I read about it, it's a really good lens for the price. I actually like the lightweight part of it, you may hear it's built cheap, to me, just because it's not metal doesn't mean it's cheap. Being light has it's advantages, the glass itself is just like the glass I used in my 35mm days, good stuff, so I don't have anything but good to say about this lens.The thing is, some people equate plastic as cheap, and in the camera world, there are also some people that are snooty, just like any other group, if you don't have a METAL prime lens, then you have junk.We are surrounded by plastics in our every day life, so why is it any different in the camera world?Buy it, you won't be sorry, and be sure to check for pricing, I have seen it jump around wildly, but it should be in the low eighties. (USD)I do want to say though, the price was good, but mine was shipped in a box about 8'x8', there was no packing, bubble wrap, peanuts, whatsoever in it, it was free floating. I couldn't believe that someone would allow that to go out like that. (It was still in the original box from Canon though, and that's probably what saved it)It did make it fine though, and it wasn't Amazon's fault really, it was the smallish company that they used though, so be careful which one you pick.I was really happy overall though, it all worked out and I still give it 5 stars. :)""

Fast focusing, but be careful, with the narrow depth of field it can get out of focus easily.  I found it helpful to switch my xTi to either manual focus or only use one of the focus points in the eye piece.As far as some of the reviews regarding this being 'cheaply made', well, its 70 bucks, you can't complain about that for the quality of picture you get. I'm not sure what you're doing with the lens that would break it either, its not made of paper.

"20080514","3.0","I'll always hate it, and always recommend it.","Let me start by echoing just about any review you'll ever read, in fact my whole review does this, and say 'For the money, this lens is worth it.' It's pretty sharp, fast and produces a nice picture.Now for why I hate it...I feel like it was built out of Legos or plastic parts out of the bottom of many cracker jack boxes. It produces errors that require me to remove it from the camera and reset it frequently, usually when the shot is most important. Be wary that this lens does know the difference between an 'important shot' and a picture of your cat and will act up accordingly as revenge on you.The mechanics are clunky and noisy, because it's made out of garbage plastic. It has hard clicks when it locks all the way to one side of the  focus ring and when moving sounds like a little kid on a big wheel coming after you.There's a lot of people who don't like to spend a lot of money on photography equipment and even the thought of an $80 lens seems a bit absurd to them. For those people I will always recommend this lens. In this case you definitely get what you pay for, but you get a little more. It's made like crap, it's not pretty, but the results are usually good and hard to beat for the price. I'd go out on a limb and say no lens in the same price range could produce the same quality pictures.However, if you're wavering back and forth between this and the F/1.4, for a few hundred more, do yourself a big favor and spend the extra money if you have it.""
"20080514","5.0","Fantastic lens!","This lens is fantastic! I've been shooting with it for about a month now and my photos are definitely looking good.

I have been looking for a great starter lens as I start up my own in-home photography business, but haven't wanted to spend a lot of money.  I would recommend this to anyone in the 'start-up' world of professional photography.  Not only that, but I don't believe you can really focus on all the other aspects of taking pictures (i.e. lighting, posing, composing the shot, etc.) until you have a lens that really enables you get good exposure even in lower light situations.

"20080511","2.0","Overrated.  IS usually better for low-light.  Iffy auto-focus","This lens is overrated.  I just took two shots of newspaper print with my XSI camera in low-light.  One with this 50mm f1.8 lens at 1/160 and f2.8, and the other with my 18-55mm IS kit lens at 1/40, f5.6.  The resulting image with the 18-55mm kit lens was much sharper.  So my simple test proved (to me anyways) that the IS makes the kit lens a better low-light performer (unless you need the higher shutter speed to stop the action).  The only other reason to get this lens is the shallower depth-of-field afforded by the wider aperture.  I would really find this useful, but the other thing I've noticed about this lens is that it often misses the focus.  So I can't trust it.Also feels far too fragile to throw the lens in my camera bag.""

Of course, this is not made of titanium, and you should always handle your camera with great care.  However, the plastic surface and design are quit consistent with Canon's style.  If you take care of your lens, I don't see how this will mysteriously fall apart with normal usage unless you purposely drop it on the floor.  The photos are very satisfying as well.  As the 50mm focal view is similar to what our natural eyes see, it's a great tool for me to practice my composition skill.  I use this on my EOS 20D.

This lens gives beginning photographers a great opportunity to get a taste of what a fast prime lens is capable of:- Works great in low light situations- Provides an excellent bokeh effect- Takes great pictures... and it is so freakin' cheap that there's no reason not to own it!The pictures produced by this lens along with the cost are what made me give it five stars, it is a great value. The downside of this lens is the inexpensive plastic build quality. After buying my first L lens, this one does feel cheap, but it's still a slight step up from the feel of the kit lens.Don't avoid buying this lens because you already own the 18-55mm. The 50mm f1.8 is a different animal that will give you an entirely different photography experience and open up more opportunities to take great shots. The 1.8 aperture lets in a ton more light than the kit lens does which makes taking pictures at night, in dim indoor environments, and at dusk a ton better.Currently I own the following lenses:Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8Canon 50mm f/1.8 IICanon 70-200mm f4 LCanon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6""
"20080409","5.0","Awesome lens and works great with BULB feature!","I think this lens is awesome and I wish I had purchased it sooner! I just received it today (ordered it 2 days ago) and was thrilled to test it out.  I went ahead and bought the hood for the lens and a UV protector, so the whole setup cost about $105.  I'm looking forward to using this lens by taking pictures of the stars (in the sky).  Other reviews are right on about the build being a bit cheap, but so far I haven't had any issues and the hood was easy to attach to the lens/uv filter.  $80 for a great lens = worth it! :)""
"20080409","4.0","Keeping it simple","50mm lenses are a true staple of contemporary photography.  Its a lens that seems to be in every kit and with good reason.  It is a natural choice for composition.  I think it has to do with complementing the way we naturally perceieve the world.  Its not as wide as a person's true field of vision, but it covers all the area that matters in a 'natural' way.That being said, if you are like me and own a camera with smaller APS-C sensor (that is: any Canon that's not a 1D or 5D or film camera) this lens is not truly 50mm.  With the 'crop factor' of these other cameras, this lens becomes an 80mm lens.  Which is ok, but you should know that going in.  If you want that 50mm look on an APS-C sensor, you should get a 30mm lens.The low light/natural light capability of this lens is still a big asset.  I've pulled this out at candle lit vigils (with some extra ambient street lights) and had great results.  For what it is- a beginner lens- its great, but on a 'beginner' camera you may be surprised how closeup the image is.""
"20080409","4.0","Great for the $","This lens is a great buy.  Obviously, it is fixed at 50, which apparently is more like 80.  I have used it quite a bit, and i am really glad i bought it.  I didnt really appreciate how NOT  wide it is until i tried using it indoors a lot.""
"20120212","4.0","You can't go wrong....for the price.","This prime lens is priced in a manner that you MUST buy it.  This is a very fast lens but has a bit of trouble with sharpness at f/1.8.  Not sure if it's the focusing mechanism or the lens quality itself.  I've been able to take pictures at night under candle light, with no camera shake but the focus itself can be off a bit.  Pictures taken with more available light turn out better, but still I would say the majority are 'soft'.  Certainly not bad enough to discard, especially if you are using this lens to take pictures as a hobby photographer.  Professionals would definitely need to use a higher quality 50mm lens...but for the average person who owns a DSLR, this definitely should be in their camera bag.Pros:-It has a very shallow depth of field which I think looks great-It's a very light lens and won't add much weight or bulk-Auto focus / Manual focus switch makes it quick to go between AF and MF-Takes pictures in very low light-Focus time is just as good as the kit lens-PriceCons:-Soft images at f/1.8-Loud and slow focusing compared to USM lenses-No Image StabilizerI can't decide if this should be a 3 star or 4 star review....I'm going with 4 star because of the price.  I am using this lens on a Canon T2i.""

"20120208","5.0","6 stars, if I could.","What an amazing lens. What else can I say? I received this lens about a week ago, and it has done nothing but constantly amaze me with the pictures it takes. With an aperture that can go as high as 1.8, you're able to shoot in low-light situations while also keeping a relatively low ISO and still keep your shutter speed up. Which makes for crisp, clear photos instead of blurry or noisy (grainy) photos that comes as a result of a high ISO and lower aperture. You just simply can't beat the price either. Other similar lenses, like the Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 and Canon EF 28mm f/1.8 are $400 minimum. This lens is one fourth the price. Basically, stop reading this and buy it. Now.""

"20120203","4.0","Very Sharp, Cheap Build","What a great little piece of plastic. It is small and light but like everyone says, it feels like a toy. The focusing ring is very small and not smooth. People don't buy this lens for the build quality. It's the sharpness. I love using it on my 40D. At an equivalent 85mm on a crop camera, it is the perfect portrait lens. Sharp results wide open and a nice out of focus background. The bokeh is not the greatest but if you an amateur it doesn't really matter. For the price it is probably the best deal you will ever get on a lens. If you have the money, definitely go for the 50mm 1.4 but if you're on a budget this is still a great lens. If all you own is the kit lens you will be amazed at the sharpness and what 1.8 looks like.""
"20120202","5.0","Beautiful pictures, great depth of field for the price!","This is the first lens I have bought other than the one that came with my Canon SLR Rebel when it was purchased.

I am so happy with this lens, and you really can't find a better lens for the price!""

"20120201","5.0","Lens review from a novice photographer","As photography has become a new hobby of mine, I do not have much to compare this lens to, other than the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens that came with my Canon XS. And since receiving this lens, it is the only one I have used. Really, all I can say is what I've learned from using this lens and no other.1)It is fast.2)The images in focus are sharp, even in low light settings.3)Those not in focus have a nice blur/bokeh.4)It is loud.5)The lens body is made of plastic.The first 3 were all I was really looking for in a 50mm, and I'm happy I got these with only paying $100. The last 2 are what I imagine can only be expected when paying $100. If anything, the cheap build quality can only teach me to take good care of my lenses. And as for the loudness, I'm just going to have to learn how to get a good photo of my dog on the first attempt (he runs from the camera as soon as he hears the shutter).Being a newbie to photography, I'm not entirely sure how involved I will get. So there was no sense in me spending over $300 on a lens. Now that I've used this lens, I have no doubt that I will learn much of what I need to of shooting with a 50mm through its use.""

"20080407","5.0","Every Canon SLR owner needs this lens","Disclaimer: my lens hasn't broken yet, so for me, so far, the build quality hasn't been an issue.  Maybe it will be in he future when I drop it on the carpet and break it.  But that hasn't happened yet.  When and if it does, I will buy another one.I love this lens.  The pictures are sharp and beautiful.  Getting a precise focus is a bit tricky with such a shallow depth of field, but when you nail it, the results are outstanding.  Good smooth bokeh, sharp IQ corner to corner, and at f1.8 I never have to bump up past ISO 1600 on my 20D to freeze motion, even at night or at concerts.  If you want to spend $200 more for the more solid f1.4, that would be fine.  But if you don't, you would be stupid not to buy this lens.""

The results this lense produced were incredible. The color and contrast were amazing and the sharpness is also undeniable. Great for indoor & low light shooting due to its wide aperture. Sure the 1.4 may be better in low light, and according to various reviews, 1.4 is a great piece of lense (I'm pretty sure they're right). I may have gone with the 1.4 if I had the $ for it, but I've never regretted going for the 1.8, not once.As for the build quality, what can I say? If one of your criterias on choosing a lense is build quality, this lense should be at the bottom of your list (perhaps not even on your list). This lense is no tank like the L lenses. It's light, flimsy, and if I shake my lense slightly, I can feel and hear some of the inside moving... AND I DON'T CARE! Yes, the build quality may be sub-par, but the results this lense produce certainly outweigh the negative build quality. My first 1.8 crapped out on me after about 3 years (didn't focus, AF or MF). When I found out it was broken, hell, I just got a new one (pretty cheap for a lense). Still rattled when I shook it, still had the plastic lense mount, still flimsy looking, but it is on my 20D almost 80% of the time.Some may think that this lense is just a big hype because of its price but you won't regret this lense.""

I tried it, and was not happy at all.  Indoors, it never seemed to want to auto-focus.  And switching to manual is no fun because the manual focus ring is too small and seems almost flimsy/sloppy to use.  The image quality was mediocre, at best.  I found that I rarely used this lens for much of anything.  I only used it a handful of times to play with to see what it could do, but never found it to be a must-have lens.

If you are using a kit zoom lens with your Canon SLR, you owe it to yourself to try one of these to see just how well your camera can perform.  You won't regret it, and at this price, if it breaks, it's easy to replace. Highly recommended for those high-school camera jockeys shooting at high-school gym events and of course for portraiture.

I knew this going in, but even I was suprised to see HOW flimsy it was in person.  Everyone seems to rave about its sharpness and color quality.  It seems to compare to my lens kit, which is an 18-55mm Ultrasonic f/3.5-5.6 in terms of sharpness/color.  I also shot it against my Canon 50mm f/2.5 Compact-Macro (w/ aperture & shutter speed set the same, on a tripod for exact results).  The results were pretty well dead on.  I couldn't see a huge difference in the two.After shooting with this lens for a couple of hours, I decided to put it back in its box, and send it back.  I don't see what all the hype is about.  To top it off, it's a prime (non-zoom)lens.  I thought I could look past this to get those 'great shots' everyones talking about.  After having to move back and forth shooting my products, I was almost to tired to package the box for the return...I wouldn't recommend getting this lens.

But I find it not coming out of my bag much anymore, I guess the novelty has worn off.  I suggest everyone own this lens because of the price and the low light imaging ability but on a 1.6 crop camera it's a little too long to be a walk around lens and not quite long enough to be a good portraiture lens (and the five-bladed aperture can make the bokeh look weird if you have a contrasty background).""

"20080210","5.0","The Most Dangerous Game","I can only concur with the other reviews. This is lightweight, plastic, and feels like a toy. Whenever I take off the lens cap I am worried that I will break the manual focus ring. The lens doesn't have a distance scale. The autofocus motor is louder than a typical compact digital camera, although not offensively loud.On the other hand, and this is a huge factor that outweighs all the above, the image quality is very good, at least when stopped down. The lens is objectively unimpressive at f1.8 - soft, with lots of vignetting, although you might enjoy these two attributes as an artistic effect - but it gets better as it is stopped down. From f2.8 onwards it is sharp and flat from centre to corner, and for the price it is very impressive. On a 1.6x camera the focal length is good for head-and-shoulder portraits / upper torso 8x10-style shots, although for anything else it feels between two stools, neither telephoto enough for lions nor wide enough for general shots. I have since used it on a full-frame camera, and the above criticisms apply; it is unimpressive at f1.8, but gets better, and the small size is a bonus. As far as I can tell from looking at the reviews and sample photographs, when stopped down this lens is at least the equal of all of Canon's other lenses at 50mm, zooms and primes and Ls alike.I have since bought some older 50-55mm prime lenses, including a Super Takumar f1.4, a Yashinon f1.4, and a Porst f1.2. I prefer the f1.4 lenses over the Canon 50mm when stopped down, and given the narrow depth of field at open apertures I also prefer manual focus. On the other hand, in a studio setting, or with plenty of light, when stopped down to f8 the Canon 50mm is as good as anything. I've also have a very brief go with the MkI version of the lens, which had a louder autofocus mechanism but felt stronger; I couldn't detect and optical difference, but then again I didn't take very many pictures.""
"20080209","5.0","Great prime lens","I've enjoyed photography since the 70s. This Canon f1.8 50mm lens is very sharp and accurate and light weight. Zoom lens are fun and versatile but a fixed focal length lens will almost always be sharper and manage depth of field better. Aberrations are quite minimal on this lens. The 1.8 50mm is a great value and highly recommended. One last thought. Some reviews comment on build quality. Canon uses a composite lens mount instead of metal. This lens is physically short and very light weight. The use of a composite is smart engineering. The physics of such a short lens would dictate that there will be minimal stress placed on the mount compared to the leverage and stress that a longer (telephoto) lens would have.""

Definitely one of my best purchases as far as lenses goes (that coming from someone who doesn't have an L yet of course).I doubt I'll ever get rid of this little lens, like I said great bang for the buck.""
"20080208","5.0","Great Prime lens","I was referred to this lens by photography forums claiming that this was a good, inexpensive lens for indoor sports photography.  I was having trouble with my current Canon lenses getting enough light into the picture, so the f/1.8 sounded good to me.  Being an amateur photographer, I don't want to spend money on strobes or lighting that are too hard to place and harder for me to understand. I just wanted a good shot of the basketball team in action.  This lens really made the difference for me.  It takes great shots, clear and lets enough light in that I can take the ISO down to 1000 and still get great shots at 500 shutter speed.  I would recommend this product to any amateur looking to get good shots indoors without a flash.""
"20080208","4.0","fun but plastic","If your an amateur photographer this is the lens for you.It's cheap, it's fun, but it's plastic.When you hold this lens you might feel as though it will crumble inyour hands, and it might, but the results are great !And if it does break, it's cheap enough that you won't curse it too long.""

"20080205","2.0","Wont last more then 2 months with normal use, atleast mine didnt!","This is a great lens. The pictures are very sharp and crisp, however; as everybody has mentioned the build quality is very very cheap. This camera will not last more then few months with normal, regular use!I had the lense for about a month and fell in love with it, but just after a month the lens literally came apart while It was auto focusing, still mounted on the camera. This lens is poorly built and very very delicate and it's just a short matter of time before this lens dies or falls apart,then you will have to buy a new one. I mailed my lens in for repair since it was still under warrenty, but Canon refused to cover the repair expense because they claimed that I dropped the lense causing it to come apart like it did, when in fact I had been very aware of it's cheap quality and had been extra careful with it and the lens broke on it's own. It was never dropped or abused!(yes the build quality is that bad!!).So the bottom line is, it's not worth it!  I lost weeks of missed photo opportunity while it was in repair, going thru the hassel of mailing, dealing with the customer service, and charging me to $50(repair)+$18(shipping)=$68 total for repair.Save yourself a lot of trouble and headache and spend few more bucks and buy the Canon 50mm f/1.4 for around $300. It is better lens and will last much longer!""
"20080203","4.0","good quality, inexpensive lens","Sure the build quality is bad. What do you expect? It costs under $75. The image quality is amazing though.

"20080202","5.0","great lense for yor Canon XTi","This is a great lens.  I is very small and light but is sharp and fast.  It is plastic but it does not feel ship, is just light.

"20080127","5.0","For the price a bargain.","Short and sweet, this is a nice little lens.  If you need a fast cheap lens this is it.  Super light because it's plastic.  I use this on a Canon 40D.  For the low end of $70.00 it can't be beat.""
"20080125","5.0","Awesome","I bought the lens because of the rave reviews and it does not disappoint. The lens is very light and does feel plastiky but that doesn't matter. I use it much more often than my 28-135mm for my kids. For the price, you can't go wrong.""
"20080125","5.0","It's all about clarity","Great lens--and so affordable.  I am new to SLR photography and have just begun shooting manual.  I am surprised at how much better the image quality is with the fixed focal length lenses as compared to my Canon zooms.  I bought this to test it out and haven't taken it off since.  It's my favorite lens.  I'm now taking the kind of photos I had hoped when I bought an SLR.  My zoom lens shots are generally 'softer'; this thing takes sharper images.  This model does not have a metal mount, which apparently means it's less durable and will supposedly not last as long- so that's probably the only downside.  But as long as you're careful with it I can't imagine a problem--and you certainly can't beat the cost.""

Manual focus is located in at the end of the lens and is very inconvenient to use.Conclusion:If your on a budget or new to DSLR photography and don't want to spent 4X the money on the 50mm 1.4 get this lens. It's plenty fast and you won't be disappointed in the images. It's impossible to find another lens at this price that performs this well.""
"20080119","5.0","Sweet buy","I use this with a Canon XTi. This lens while limiting as a fixed, has a wonderful aperture for the price and I have been able to get wonderful portraits with it.

"20080118","5.0","A MUST HAVE FOR INDOOR PHOTOGRAPHY","No zoom, not wide, not tele, not built like a tank, but the photos are phenomenal. The main reason is that it allows indoor photography without flash. A second reason is a narrow depth of field that blurs the background.""

"20080116","5.0","Great lens.  Well worth the money.","I bought this lens to use with my first SLR(Canon XT).  True it is the cheapest lens Canon offers, but it is a very good lens.  It is constructed of plastic, so I take a little more care in handling it.  But it doesn't seem fragile.  Nothing would lead me to belive it would fall apart on it's own.  I've only been using it for a little less then a month, but the images I have taken with it this far make me look good as a photographer.  It's cheap, shoots excellent quality images, and easy on the wallet if it does ever break.  I recommend it highly.""
"20080115","4.0","Superb image quality","I think that the title says it all. It is one of the cheapest lens on the market, if not the cheapest. But that said, it actually a great lens to have. The image quality is superb. You will take unbelievable photos with this lens. The bokeh, colors and contrast is amazing. On the down side, it feels really cheap...you have to be careful handling it because it feels very fragile.Overall....for this amount of $ I can guarantee that you will not find a lens that has such a great image quality. Of course it feels cheap (it is cheap) and the focus is not USM but it works OK. So do not hesitate. This lens is a must for any beginner. I almost forgot....the 1.8 aperture is outstanding. I wonder why didn't Canon supply the EOS 350D and 400D with this lens as a kit. Light years away from the kit lens. By the way...i have a 350D.""

"20080114","5.0","Best lense you can buy for that kind of money","Canon designed this lens to be their high performance, low cost option.  Yeah, it's a prime lens, it has a plastic mount, there's no distance scale, and the focus ring is small, but for the price and optical quality, who cares.  If I ever do break off the mount, I can buy another one and still have paid less than it would have cost for a used mark-1.  You can always get more lenses, but you will still use this one even if you are a pro.  Basically, if you care about optical performance and you're not loaded, buy this lens.""
"20080114","5.0","Fantastic lens","I have lenses that cost over $2,000 and this is still one of my favorites.  It is versatile, takes amazing portrait pictures and is very lightweight and affordable.I would highly recommend this lens to any beginner or any photography fancier looking to add to their collection.  I have taken really nice action shots, as well as portraits shots with great background blur.You will love this lens and it's one of the few times you actually get more than what you paid for!!""
"20080113","4.0","Excellent lens, DSLR users beware","This lens is an amazing value for the price, considering its fast 1.8 aperture. DSLR users should be aware that because many DSLRs use non-full frame sensors, the focal length will be multiplied by a factor listed with the camera specs. For example, my Canon Digital Rebel XTi magnifies the focal length by 1.6x, resulting in an 80mm effective focal length, even tho it is rated at 50mm. This limits this lens, in my case, to being either an excellent and versatile portrait lens, a somewhat useful macro lens (with appropriate filter to reduce minimum focus distance), or a very short, long lens.I love this lens for its price and its speed. It was definitely worth the $, and is a great lens for specific uses.""

"20080109","5.0","A price winner!","This is the second lens that I bought for my Canon Rebel XTi (first being the Canon 17-85mm IS zoom lens), also my first 'fast' lens and first non-zoom lens.Hell yeah, you can't beat 70 bucks for a 1.8 lens. Well, maybe you can, I don't know, but it felt a lot better than the $400+ for my zoom or the $300 for my flash!I read previous reviews that said it was 'plasticy' and cheap but I disagree. It feels pretty solid, takes awesome large aperture portrait pics, and has an undeniable price-point. $70 is like a stick of gum for camera parts (sadly).Some of my FAVORITE (and worst!) pictures have been taken with this lens, always wide open. My other lens is between 4-5.6 fstops depending on zoom, so this provides a much wider aperture for me to play with. It's my preferred baby-picture lens.The bad: AF is noisy and 'searches' a lot (compared to my USM zoom lens). Cannot focus much less than 1-2 feet (NOT a macro lens!). Costs too little -- wait, that's a PLUS!I'd recommend it unless you're already considering a pricey lens that could fill the same role. If you have the kit lens or similar with larger minimum aperture, this a great fast lens to add on the cheap!""
"20080109","4.0","Nice little lens","It's great to have a fast lens and for $75, you can't go wrong.  It's cheap, it's plastic but the glass is great thus far.

This lens is great for taking fairly close shots, but I have already ordered a zoom lens since the fixed is limiting in that way.  I love taking picures of my standard poodle... you can focus on the end of his nose and his eyes will be a little blurry.  Or you can focus on his eyes and the other elements blur.  I'm just having a lot of fun with it.  For the price, you cannot beat this lens.""

"20080107","4.0","Advice to parents","As a parent that bought a DSLR for the sole purpose of taking good quality pics of my toddler and my newborn,  I highly recommend this lens.  The kit lens on the Canon Xti is good but its not very good indoors and in low light situation.  Unfortunately,  most of my pics are indoors because of personal preference and situations.  I debated about getting the 580 EZ Speedlite flash but my budget is tight so I decided to wait. That is until I stumble upon the customer photo gallery for this lens. Amazing! Those pics are taken with an Xti and this lens and no flash!! I can do that setup!!!  I excitedly ordered the lens and it came in 3 days with free shipping.PRO:1)No Flash needed indoors/low light so your kids don't get annoyed while being photograph.2)Cheap3)Capable of taking way better pics than the kit lens4)Bokeh!CONS (I can only think of one based on my intended use of the lens):1)  Might break easily according to the other costumer reviews.In conclusion, If your situation is the same as mine I highly recommend this lens.

"20080101","4.0","Great lens for the Price","I purchased this lens for to take pictures of indoor sporting events: swim meets and wrestling tournaments.  We had trouble using the other two lenses we had (18-55mm and 75-300mm USM) as they were too slow to get crisp photos in these low light situations.The Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens has a plastic, 'cheaper feeling' build.  Don't let this fool you though.  The lens has performed remarkably well.  Very Nice pictures in these indoor events and it makes a nice portrait lens as well.The bottom line is that although the lens is super-light, and not of the highest quality build (what do you expect for &lt;$100?) I recommend this lens to anyone who would like a fast lens for a great price.With a price of under $100 and a very fast F/1.8 light factor....

The images are sharp and clear at all apertures.Build quality and autofocus are this lens's only weaknesses.  It's inexpensive, so I wasn't expecting anything special, but the all-plastic construction does feel a bit frail.  The autofocus feels slow to me and hunts in low light.  Overall, however, this is a great piece of equipment.Keep in mind that this is an 80mm f/1.8 lens on a Rebel due to the focal length multiplier.  I find it fairly versatile, but it really shines on portraits.""

Low light shots during the ceremony were fantastic.Additionally, this may seem like a cheap little lens but I accidentally tested the durability by dropping it from a 4 foot counter onto a hard wood floor. I thought for sure that I had just flushed $[...] down the drain. However, I gave it a quick test and it still performs flawlessly. Don't let the cheap build discourage you from buying this fantastic lens!!My only complaint is the slow auto-focus.

That means no zooming in or out. if you want to see what that's like. Take the kit lens, zoom to 50mms, and try a little photography/videography. The aperture (1.8) basically means no grain. You can shoot in low-light at ISO 800 and you still won't have much grain. Haveing beautiful soft focus on this lense gives ever picture a sharp, clear look. The price can't be beat either.

"20071219","5.0","Amazing Lens!","This lens is amazing. When I first saw how cheap it was I closed the Amazon webpage thinking it was trash. However, upon talking to my photography friends they all rated the lens very highly. So, I plopped down $79 for the lens after reading all of the reviews.First off, I have a Canon EOS XT and a 40D. The XT came with the 17-55mm and the 40D came with the 28-135mm. When the 50mm arrived from Amazon I went outside to take a few test shots. I was amazed at the picture sharpness and the depth of color in the shots. When I blew up the shots to 100% the sharpness of the image was jaw dropping compared to the kit lenses I'd been using.Sure, the 50mm lens isn't a zoom lens but let me tell you something important: with this lens I learned how to compose shots. Before I'd just take mindless pictures - stand in one place and shoot away. This lens taught me to compose an image to make it interesting because I had to move my feet to get the picture I wanted instead of mindlessly zooming back and forth. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to become a better photographer.My sister bought my Rebel XT. I'm letting her use my 50mm - she likes it so much that I didn't get it back. &lt;cough> So I bought another 50mm. :)The build quality is not very good however it works. The lens is super light (a plus for a heavy 40D) and it won't break unless you drop the lens (what lens wouldn't?). Otherwise, if you take care of the lens I see this lens lasting a long time. I'll report back here if I find out otherwise.""
"20071219","4.0","A good starter lens","This was the first lens I purchased with my Rebel XTi.  And I still hold that it was a good choice.  Appart form it being a little cheaply made and the lack of IS its a pretty good little thing.  All my pictures are nice and bright becasue of the wide aperture.  Most of the stuff I do are close ups so the lack of stablization doesnt matter too much, but they can get fuzzy if you're shooting quickly.  Also, i'm not sure if its the lens or the body but it has a lot of trouble focusing in low light.""
"20071218","5.0","AWESOME LENS!","WOW. That's all I can say. This lens is awsome for the price! It has a great depth of field and the auto-focus is pretty responsive. If your looking for a good close up locked focal length lense at a great price, this is the lens for you. While it is plastic as apposed to metal, I didn't think it felt cheap like some of the other reviews state. In good lighting conditions I was able to rattle off exposures about as fast as my other lens.""

"20071214","4.0","Cheap lens, but great when used right.","At around $80 to get a f1.8 lens is just great and on top of that this lens can produce some great images. Now the quality of this lens isn't close to other Canon lenses, this is cheaply made and feels almost like a toy. On a nice DSLR this lens looks comically small, however if you stop it down a bit, you can end up with some sharply focused images and still have some great background blur. Because I have the 85mm 1.8 I rarely use this lens, but am still glad I got it for when 85mm is actually too much magnification. Worth picking up if portraits or possibly product photography interests you.""
"20071213","5.0","I. Love. This. LENS!!!!!","Oh, where to start?!? I absolutely love this lens! It is, quite simply, the best bang-for-your-buck lens in photography today. Its optics are quite sharp and I haven't had a shot yet that didn't come out the way I expected to with this lens. Lightweight. Decent construction for the price you pay. Yes, it is all plastic. But it feels quite sturdy, as if it could take a few knocks before completely being out of service. I use mine mostly for indoor photography with a UV lens to protect the front element. Using it wide open, I can get very clear shots without a flash in the range of 1/30 to 1/60 of a second depending on ambient lighting. So, am I happy I bought it? Absolutely. Would I buy it again? In a heartbeat. Would I change anything about it? At this price, absolutely not! So if you're straddling the fence about it, just buy it! You will NOT regret it!""
"20071213","5.0","Fantastic Value and no 2nd House Mortgage Required","I can't figure out why Canon made this so good for so cheap, compared to its other offerings, but that is what has happened.Bottom line ... this is a portrait and moderate distance lens needing lots of indoor space for group shots on an APS-C EOS body.  Outdoors, you can distance yourself as needed.  In either case, the results are knock-down gorgeous where the f/1.8 aperture really opens up the capability of your Rebel, et. al. If all you have used to date is the EOS kit lens, this one will cause you to pucker in delight.Some folk claim to use this as a walk-around, single lens, but that's got to work a body silly trying to get the right range in what equates to an 80mm film camera lens on an APS-C EOS body. For an EOS 35mm film camera, it's probably dead on perfect for walk-a-round. In either case, you should eventually own this lens. The housing is cheap, but with care it will last just fine.""
"20071210","4.0","Bang for the buck","I debated about whether to buy the 50mm 1.4, 50 mm 1.8, or else the Sigma 30mm f1.4.  It boiled down to this: I own a Digital Rebel XT.  I was not sure as to the relevance of the 50mm lens on my crop factor camera and the Sigma represents the closest way to get to a standard prime (i.e. old 50mm on a full frame machine).  And I may end up with a 5D this spring, so I didn't want to plunk down $400 bucks on the Sigma and end up with something I wouldn't need if I end up with a full frame...weighty choices.So I bought the cheap-o lens, figuring what harm is there in plunking down a few bucks.  I took it around the rainy streets of NYC and shot a bunch of test shots.  It's everything everyone here says it is: a cheap piece of junk, loud, and razor sharp.  It produces incredible colors and, although not razor sharp at 1.8 (not bad, though!), stopped up to F2.2 it rages in terms of clarity...and that's a lot of light for 70 bucks.So...the F1.4 or the F1.8.  If you are concerned enough to think you might want to get the 1.4, get it.  Anything (even the lousy kit lens from my Rebel XT) is arguably of better build quality...and you will have the 1.4 50 for life with the option to manually touch up focus (which is awesome).  But for knocking around town with a lightweight, inexpensive piece of glass, this thing is really first rate.At some point I am sure to want to upgrade to another prime lens, but for now, while getting reacquainted with photography, this will be great.  I assume it will break within a year of shooting, and then I will consider the way to upgrade.""
"20071207","4.0","excellent for the price, but very flimsy","I really wanted to buy the 50mm f/1.4 lens, but I was concerned that this focal length would be useless for a 1.6x crop Digital Rebel XT (~80mm). So I decided to take the risk with the cheaper 50mm f/1.8 lens. I was not disappointed and this lens produces very sharp pictures. More importantly the focal length of 80mm (on a 1.6x crop) is very usable for single person shots (or two if close by) even in tight rooms. Despite being a low light lens, the pictures were much better looking color-wise when I bounced flash off my canon 580ex II flash.""
"20071203","5.0","If you only have zoom lenses, you have GOT to get this","If all you have are zoom lenses for your Canon EOS camera, you have got to give this lens a try.  It is simply the sharpest lens for the money.  Period.  As good as any 'L' zoom lens (and I own a few.)Sure, the 50mm f/1.4 and some others might have marginally better bokeh, but they also cost much more.This lens is ideal for portraits or some landscape shots unless you need a wider angle.  For sports, the focus is a bit too slow.Believe it or not, this is my preferred lens for weddings and posed pictures.I can't overstate how incredibly crisp the images from this lens are.""

Past F/4 it just gets better.  Yes it does feel a bit cheap, plastic, light.  Has a bit of barrel distortion, the focus motor isn't as fast or quite as the ultrasonic lenses.  Bokeh isn't as sweet as 1.4, But for this price range, it is a super sharp lens.  Will beat 24-70mm 2.8 L at 50mm.  Highly recommend, especially if you use 'full sensor' Canon's.  (5D, 1Ds or Film)""

You just can't go wrong.  Pictures a sharp as can be, without flash in low light its still a joy (I hate flash photography), and background blur is very pretty.Re: Cheap Construction ... seems fine to me.  My Rebel has a plastic case, I'm not sure why the lenses should be any different.  I handle my gear with care and respect and I can't imagine how I could damage the lens without dropping it ... that'd break most lenses.""

I'm probably going to be very pleased with this lens once I truly learn how to use it to its fullest potential.""
"20071125","5.0","Terrific, Fast, Sharp","This lens is everything you have heard -terrific, fast, and sharp. It works amazingly well in low-light situations, and low-light events. Photos taken with this lens from the front couple rows of a concert for example give you brilliant colorful well-saturated shots at low ISO settings.

If you don't, then change your settings to see just how sharp your entire frame can be. Unless you have the extra $300 for the 50mm f1.2 (I forget if it's 1.2 or 1.4), just buy this thing. It's fantastic for portraits, food, flowers, day to day snapshots... those are things I use it for most often.""
"20071119","5.0","Best lens for the money, hands down","This lens should be a required buy for anyone getting their first dSLR. Yes, it's cheaply built - don't drop it. No, it's not going to withstand years of abuse - it likely won't survive years of *normal* use. But images taken with it are crystal clear, the next step up (f1.4) is $200 more, and most importantly, this is a great learning lens. The fixed focal length forces you to be creative in framing your shots, makes you think about what you're shooting before you hit the shutter. f/1.8 is great for low-light situations, and absolutely brilliant for shots of people; if I'm hanging out with family or friends and I want a good all-around lens, I'll take my 50mm without hesitation.You know what I'm sick of? Amazon putting an $89 pricetag on something like this while setting it next to a scratched out $150 'list price' - as if there's any shop, anywhere on the internet, that would try and charge that much for this lens. It's a cheap and lazy sales tactic, and I could ignore it if not for the fact that it's *everywhere*. I'm looking at the Tamron 17-50 f/2.8, selling for $404. 'List' price? $763. In what world?""
"20071115","5.0","Great lens for the money","Bought this lens for some indoors sports photos and portraits.  Tested for both and it's worked amazingly.  1.8 lets me take photos in places I would have never thought possible without using the flash.Using with a 20D and Speedlite 430.  works like a champ for portraits and action shots.""
"20071112","5.0","A must-have for the price","I've been shooting with this lens for about a month now. It's a must-have for the price. I was annoyed with the performance of the Digital Rebel XTi kit lens (18-55mm) in low light, so I picked up the 50mm f/1.8. I'm completely happy with it. It's not as sturdy or hefty as the kit lens, since it seems to be made completely of plastic, but that hasn't caused me any trouble. It's also very light, which can be a relief after lugging around the camera body with larger/heavier lenses. As a prime lens, your zooming is now controlled by your feet (requiring that you physically move around to get the right framing and composition of your shot), but that's par for the course with any prime lens. I had a little trouble with manual focus - it seemed difficult to stop the focus ring at precisely the right spot - but I'm still working on my manual focus skills, so that might not be a problem for more experienced shooters. The lens is a lot more noisy than the kit lens or my telephoto USM lens, so if you need quiet autofocus, you might want to go for a higher end lens. The shallow depth of field at f/1.8 takes some getting used to, but with a little practice at choosing my backgrounds, I'm really happy with the results. Overall, you can't beat this lens for the price. The photos I have taken with it are much more sharp than those coming out of my kit lens, and I'm able to shoot indoors with available light much more easily with the wide open f/1.8.""
"20071109","5.0","For the price, it can't be beaten...","I purchased this lens for my Digital Rebel less than a month ago and couldn't be happier with its performance.  Not only is it one of the sharpest lenses I have ever used, it gives you a ton more flexibility for shooting in low light situations.  Plus, the depth of field and bokeh when shooting wide open is astounding!On another note, the 50mm focal length (when used with the correct magnification viewfinder) represents the normal magnification of the human eye.  I got a chance to shoot with this lens on a 40D and I could easily shoot with both eyes open, therefore dramatically reducing eye fatigue.Sure, it is quite lightweight and a little more plasticky than I would normally prefer, but for the price you really can't go wrong.  Cheap, sharp, and fast...that's how I like it.  Great for macro shots when reversed as well.  Every SLR photographer, no matter how novice or advanced, should have one of these little guys in their gear bag.""
"20071108","5.0","Good, fast, and cheap","With its large aperture, the lens is great for low to moderate lit, indoor shots of my kids.  And being small and light, I can fit it and the 40D in a compact bag which previously housed my G3 and lens adapter.While I occasionally shoot at 1.8, f/2.5 gives good results when it comes to subject sharpness and blurred backgrounds.  At under $80, this is a great buy.""
"20071107","4.0","Quality pictures with plastic mount","I'm a student photographer and I bought this lens to break free of my 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 that came in the kit with my rebel XTi. I love low light shooting as much as I love natural lighting, so this is a great lens for me. Since the lens is so low profile, I find I'm even able to get away with taking shots as slow as 1/3rd of a second. Yes, the lens is made of mostly plastic but I take care of my camera equipment and I haven't had any problems in the month I've been using it so far. Bottom line, great lens, could have been built a little more sturdy but that doesn't take away from the image quality.""
"20071105","5.0","Just buy it.  You will be amazed you can get such great shots from a $70 lens","I liked this lens so much, I bought one for my mother-in-law. it has a very cheap feel, but the narrow depth of field that you get from its 1.8 f-stop is great. It's also great for low light indoor portrait shots!""
"20071104","5.0","More than I bargained for. Seriously.","Lenses are funny things. We'll spend hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars for a lens. Bokeh, the widest possible aperture, reputed clarity of the glass - those things that affect the picture - have to be measured against the impact to our wallets. We'll cough up for AF, IS, even cool stuff like catadioptrics or telephotos so long we look like anteaters carrying them around. Sometimes it gets to the point where we think we *have* to spend a lot of money, lenses are so cool.And yes, I've spent the big money for lenses; I don't like doing it, but sometimes, it seems like to get the features you want, you just have to.This lens taught me something. Maybe you *don't* have to. I'll tell you why.I bought a new camera. An EOS 40D. A great camera for me, does the things I like, and does them well. My first Canon, though, I had no lenses. So I thought long and hard about what lens to get first. I ended up buying a macro lens, about $500 out of pocket by the time it was shipped to me. A great lens, and you bet I got some great macro shots. But it was a *macro* lens, and you know it was only a few days before I was pining to shoot some 'regular' images. I looked at all manner of lenses, and the choices were just too much. I ended up unable to decide on anything.So... then I saw this. $73? What the heck, let me get this and I'll have something to play with until I can decide among the many others that were seriously vying for my attention.And THEN... then I received the lens. Now I don't feel what it was that attracted me to the more expensive lenses. That's how good this baby is. It's true, it doesn't have as many blades as a higher end lens and so your background blur - bokeh - is a little bit polygonal instead of nice round blurs; but frankly, I consider that to be nit picking in the extreme. Look at the beautiful samples people have uploaded here, actual results, and you can see that it will do a great job of isolating foreground objects. The bokeh is fine unless you're in some kind of pro competition or you are so finicky about your photos you sit in front of your prints all night, twisting your hands like someone who's had too much coffee.Plus, this thing is really, really sharp. Give it the best chance - lots of light, tripod mount, fast shutter speed - and you'll be rewarded with pixel level detail, or at least as much as the optical low pass filter in your camera lets through to your sensor if you're shooting digital. I was *astonished* at the clarity, the EOS 40D's 10 mp sensor would surely find any glass problems, but... nothing. It makes perfect pictures. The AF works precisely, so that using center point only on my 40D, I was able to resolve exact details on many subjects using nothing but the AF. This is *not* typical behavior for an inexpensive lens.Speed: It's pretty quick, all right, especially if you're willing to sacrifice some depth of field. Canon's got an f/1.2 in the L series for about 20 times the price if this really isn't quick enough. Though I suspect that most of you, like me, look at lenses priced well above $1000 and quickly find other things we want to buy instead. Like a whole new camera! With this lens, you can literally shoot decent space photos on a high-megapixel camera just by setting the lens to wide open aperture, laying your camera on its back, and using a good fast ISO setting. There's a good example of this in the gallery. I tried it for myself, and it worked great (by the way, see if you can find a moment to rate that photo up... it's a terrific example of what the lens can do!) Frankly, that's something only a really fast lens can pull off, at least, in my experience - because if you keep the shutter open too long, you'll have star trails instead of points.Features: It's a basic lens. It just works. Which is just what we want, of course. But that's not to say it doesn't bring some features to the table.It's good from about one and a half feet out to infinity; it's autofocus, but you can't touch the focus ring while it is driving it - it isn't a full time manual focus design. There's a switch for manual / AF mode in the usual place. One thing I appreciated was the red alignment dot being a physical nub instead of just being silk-screened on (or inside!) the lens - I change lenses around often, and I really eyeball those dots a lot to save wear and tear on the camera. You get both the lens covers you need, one for the business end and one for the camera end (for when it isn't mounted on the camera.) It uses 52 mm filters, and the threading is well machined, I had no trouble at all attaching and removing filters. It takes the ES-62 hood, which is not included. The lens system itself is five groups of six elements for f/1.8 - they didn't just throw it together.Now, as to build. Yes, the barrel is plastic. Plastic is not a dirty word, though, really - it can be quite durable, with the right plastic in the right application.The lens feels fine, not 'cheap' at all. I mean this in the sense that the lens fits the camera well, and there are no funny noises or other warning signs of less than sufficient design.It *is* plastic, and one thing about that is that the lens is very light weight for what it does, and that makes longer shooting sessions more pleasant. I can tell you that my physically much larger macro lens tires me out in just a few minutes; this lens doesn't do that, it's almost like it weighs nothing - it's only 4.6 ounces, all of it physically close to the camera so it doesn't exert much leverage on your wrists.Here's an issue you can, and should, sink your teeth into: When focusing, the lens physically extends, and that is a difference between a more expensive lens and this one that can really matter. This is because it affects how you can use the lens. It is something you should, no, you *must*, keep in mind when using this lens. I'll explain.Actually, I would speculate that of the people who managed to destroy this lens in short order, I bet at least some of them physically had the business end of the lens resting on something, or were holding onto the focusing ring when the AF system tried to drive the lens to a new physical configuration, and poof - the gear train, or the motor, or both, went nipples north.You just can't do that - not with *any* lens that extends physically. Don't touch, or rest, the focus ring on this lens in AF mode, EVER! If you watch out for that one issue when you use it, just keep the lens free in the air and your fingers off the ring, I bet the lens will last years.Why so confident? Simple: Based on the incredible track record Canon has for its camera and lens product lines, I think we can very safely say that Canon knows precisely what they are doing, generally speaking. They're not fools, I think we can all agree.With that in mind, simply consider that Canon has placed a full one year warranty on the lens. Frankly, I don't believe they would do that if it was truly going to fall apart in a few months when used properly, as some of the less positive reviews here have said. Treat it right, it'll almost certainly treat you right. This is *Canon*, people, not the Wang Chung Junque Manufacturing Co. operating out of a cave somewhere.In the end, even if mine did break, I'd replace it in a heartbeat. It is a truly great lens for the money. Highly recommended.*** I've added an image to the image gallery that is a CLIP of a small portion of an image shot of the night sky. In it, you can clearly see the great nebula in Andromeda. I've identified the individual stars for you, and you can see the entire image by checking my flickr account (fyngyrz).

It 'can' help you capture some good pictures.  But, it 'can' also help you produce poor pictures just as often.  Next time, I'd spend a little more money and forgo this cheap lens, despite its attractively low price.In no particular order, here are my likes & dislikes, followed by a summary of my recommendation:LIKES:* It is very inexpensive* With the right combination of photographer, light, natural elements and pure luck, you'll get 'some' good photos out of it* It is light weight (this is also a 'dislike' - see below)DISLIKES:* It is very cheaply made; construction does not seem durable at all* Focusing is slow and noisy (it is especially slow in lower light, obviously)* Despite best efforts, it seems to produce just as many poor images as it does good images* Colors are not as vibrant as I'd like.I guess the summation of my review has to come down to your needs and your wallet!  This lens can serve some people well, under the correct scenarios.  So, here are some questions I recommend you ask yourself before buying:* Can you afford a more expensive 50 mm prime lens?  If so, then maybe pass on this one!* Will it see very infrequent use?  If so, then why spend more?* Do you expect it to get banged around during an extended outdoor trip?  If so, then this one might make sense because it is easily replaced due to its low cost!* Are you learning photography as a hobby and want to practice with a prime lens?  If so, then this is a great choice!* Do you demand a lens which can reliably produce very good, or better, images most of the time, and provide vibrant, eye-popping colors most of the time?  If so, then this is not a great choice.Wishing you best of luck in your decision!  Let me know if I can answer any questions!""

"20071016","5.0","10 stars if I could","Ok, well there's no big secret here, this lens has some of best glass, but the absolute worst construction of any lens ever.  However that being said there are a few things you can do to insure that your lens doesn't snap into two, like I'm sure you've read about happening.One, buy some black electrical tape and wrap it around the outside of the barrel.  Make it thick, so when you do drop it lightly onto double padded carpetting from 3 inches up, it doesn't break... maybe.Second.. buy two, so when one does break, you can just pop on the next one and keep shooting. It's worth it.Three.. keep it in a good case, with lots of padding, but make sure that padding doesn't shed off because it WILL get behind the glass, this lens is not sealed well at all.This lens, in my mind, is a 10 and is worth buying for the 75-85 dollar price here on Amazon.

"20071008","4.0","Great value","Great optics but the plastic mount makes it feel a bit unsubstantial (the only reason for the 4 stars). You will, however, be very impressed with the sharpness and the blurr factor when used at fast apertures; it is a great portrait lens.

"20071008","4.0","Gimme some bokeh!","I recently purchased a Canon Rebel Xti, EOS 10.1 MP SLR. It was an upgrade for me from a Minolta 35mm and a digital Nikon Coolpix. I found that I could not get the shots I wanted with the point and shoot cameras&iexcl;K the shutter speed was too slow and the aperture too narrow. By the time the shutter closed, my children were long gone from the image and so I got lots of blur. My point and shoots NEVER survived in low light&iexcl;Kneedless to say I have fallen in love with my &iexcl;Rebel&iexcl; and according to my husband,  spend way too much time with &iexcl;her&iexcl; In my search for a good SLR that matched my budget, I chose the Canon Rebel Xti. I also chose Rebel based on other customer reviews. I researched the camera to make sure it was the &iexcl;right&iexcl; one for me. My neighbor has an XT and she loved it. I got to see the feel of it and how it worked.The Rebel comes with an 18-55mm zoom lens, which is great for almost all photos. The clarity on this lens however is not &iexcl;top notch&iexcl; and neither is the sharpness.  The downside to moving to the SLR is that it is &iexcl;in the way&iexcl; around my neck&iexcl;Khits the kids in the face when I bend down and not as easy to &iexcl;lug&iexcl; around. Otherwise, I did not find it cumbersome to travel with. The cumbersome item was the tripod I carried in my hands.

I have had the 55 mm for about 2 weeks and shot about 700 photos with it. I paid  $75.00 for it. It is made by Canon. I really like this lens because the lens produces a nice bokeh on wide aperture shots. The lens is very fast and snaps that shot before the subject has a chance to move. I took some great photos of some geese in the UK and at f.8 1/100  I captured the movement of the birds&iexcl; wings and froze them in time. I have 3 words for this lens, sharp, fast and crisp.There are some downsides to the 50mm&iexcl;Kyour legs are the zoom. When you look through the viewfinder your subject is right in your face. Sometimes I struggle fitting everything into the viewfinder. I find this lens most appropriate for close ups and low light shooting&iexcl;K I have used it for landscapes, etc., but it is not my lens of preference for that&iexcl;K.

A deviation of only a couple of inches could result in a slightly out of focus subject.""

The focal length, and clarity, linked up with my beam-splitter gave me the results that I desired.Recently,I purchased a Canon Rebel XTi. For beam-splitting, I use the 50mm lens from my 10S. The results of course is outstanding. Keep in mind though that I only use this lens for my 3D work. I have 3 other high end Canon lenses which I use for the majority of my work.The lens in this ad is perfect for portaits (and 3D), but should be seen as an auxilliary lens, not the primary one.Mary-Margaret""
"20070928","5.0","Great lens for the money","It's a $70 lens.  It's not supposed to be heavy, or metal.  In fact, my other kit lenses are also plastic.  No big deal.This is a good lens for indoor portraits for natural lighting, but at low light / wide aperature you'll have fun focusing.  Depth of field is extremely short at f/1.8, which is both good and bad -- great shots, but tricky to focus.If you even sorta think you'd like it, go for it; $70 is a drop in teh bucket on a $500+ body.""
"20070927","5.0","Makes the camera really sing!","I purchased a Canon camera kit and added this lens as an after thought.  I played with the lens that came in the kit, but when I threw this lens on my pictures jumped right off the page!  You can't beat this lens for the price.  I found the optical quality to be everything I'll ever need, and the f1.8 delivers such control over depth of field that regular, quick snap shots really sing!  Build quality seems fine, and in all honesty, if it were to brake tomorrow, I wouldn't hesitate to order another one.""
"20070926","4.0","Great shots but feels flimsy","This is a great lens for all around use and pretty much is needed 90% of the time. Its produces clear shots. I just wish it would have a depth of field meter and be made of stronger materials.""
"20070923","5.0","A LOT of bang for the buck!","I use a Canon XTI, and have been looking for a good (and affordable) portrait lens.  I teetered about this lens for several months before finally ordering it.  I read all the reviews on Amazon, as well as researched this lens on the web.  Money IS an object for me, as I am getting my business off the ground.  My lens arrived this week. I didn't have a chance to put it on my camera until today.  All I can say is WOW!  Despite it's 'cracker-jack prize' plastic feel, this lens takes a killer picture.I shot cheerleading portraits of my daughter this afternoon, and I have to say, these are the best shots I've taken, yet.  Impressive for a lens so inexpensive.I also spoke with a fellow professional last week, after having ordered this lens, and he said he loved his; had another on order, because it fell out of his pocket & came apart in two pieces when it hit the ground, but loves the lens in spite of its plastic construction.I would recommend this lens to anyone on a budget.  My advice, though?  Be careful & don't drop it. (But I'm extra careful with all my lenses, and don't see this being a problem.)""
"20070921","4.0","A Newb Photographer's Review","I purchased this lens to mate with my XTi and so far I have had no regrets.  It does take some getting used to with the fixed focal length, but it definitely gives you an idea of composing and framing that a normal zoom lens might not give you.This lens is just great for so many reasons.  The cost was definitely attractive to me since I didn't feel comfortable spending a ton on pro-level lenses.  It works phenomenally well in low light, especially when compared to the kit lens.  The build quality itself is excellent, though the materials do not really seem to be meant for longevity.  Metal > plastic, no matter how high quality the plastic.  Focusing is a bit loud, but worked fine.The lens also lowers the profile of the camera and makes it more manageable and less conspicuous.  It's hard enough to get people to act normally with an SLR clacking away, but with this lens your subjects don't really have to worry about you zooming in on their imperfections.  Overall, this lens is highly recommended for new photographers.""
"20070921","4.0","cheepie but goodie","I read most of the 324 reviews on this lens before deciding to give it a try. I must say that the optics live up to the glowing reports and this lens is inexpensive enough that it doesn't have to last forever.  I am looking forward to many fun shots.""
"20070918","5.0","little pocket of Canon perfection","A great little lens to have in your bag when you need to make those special 'phisticated' shots.sturdy, well built/machined, tight but smooth moving rotations.Optics clear as expected from Canon.""
"20070917","4.0","Can't be beat for the price","Sharp, sharp, sharp!  Auto-focus is a little klunky and noisy, but quite acceptable and accurate on my Digital Rebel XT.  Bokeh is smooth except the five-blade diaphragm makes bright highlights in the background pentagon shaped and they look a little funky sometimes.  I bet this thing doesn't last a year, but I'll happily buy another one in a year if this thing falls apart.  The f/1.4 is better but in some subtle ways, and I can't justify the price difference being an amateur photographer.  If I was a pro, I would certainly get the f/1.4 since I'm sure this baby will pick just the wrong moment to fail catastrophically.At f/1.8, the depth of field is razor thin if your subject is up close, so don't shoot wide open if shooting portraits and you want the whole face in focus.  Otherwise you will focus on the tip of their nose and their eyes will be out of focus...  (at f/1.8 with the subject 3ft away depth of field is less than an inch.)This is a great portrait lens especially for candid: its a very small, unobtrusive lens, but its also kind of a one-trick pony to me, particularly on a dSLR with a crop factor; it is the equivalent of an 80mm lens on a Digital Rebel with its 1.6 crop factor.""

This super fast lens dosn't have rivals at 3x the price.  Plastic mounting surfaces and focusing noise that was acceptable in the early 1990s aren't really as bad as some would have you believe.  Just be gentle with it when you mount it to your camera and the plastic won't be a problem.  As for the noise, who are you trying to sneak up on with an $80 lens?""

I do agree that the feel and the build quality of this lens is a little on the cheapie delicate side but I don't think that if you're careful with your equipment you should not have anything to worry about. If you're worried about costs and are looking for something affordable that can do a great job, then do not overlook this lens. It produces great images for a good price.

"20070819","5.0","Forget build quality!  This is a GREAT lens.","Sure the build quality leaves something to be desired, but it is simply a marvelous lens, build quality notwithstanding.  And the build quality is not all that bad.  Sure the lens is not as elegant or as well built as an 'L' lens but you're only paying $75 dollars for it.  And the pictures it takes are simply beyond belief.  Beautifully saturated and amazingly sharp.  So sharp that it almost looks three dimensional.Yes the auto focus is louder and slower than an 'L' lens.  So what'd you expect from a $75 dollar lens?  But when it comes to taking pictures this lens has almost no peer.  There are probably only three or four Canon lenses that compare in PICTURE QUALITY to this lens.  The only other lenses that I've owned that are as sharp are the 200 f2.8 L lens and the 50 f1.4.  Yes the 1.4 had a better build quality and better bokeh but it was not noticably sharper and had no better color saturation.This lens will give you many many good years of service if you exercise even the slightest care for it.  I do know that it has served me well.  Buy this lens - I promise you will not be disappointed.  HOWEVER, if you appreciate good build quality and the money is not all that important then splurge and buy yourself the marginally better 50mm 1.4.Either way, you will not be disappointed.""

In natural light shots you bet!!I did some tripod mounted tests at different F stops and it's sharper at F1.8 then the kit lens is at any setting at any focal length.  However!!  You do not want to use flash with this lens.  I know I know you buy this lens to take natural light photography. But I flipped up the flash on my Rebel Xti to add light when my daughter wanted the lights out to blow out the candles on her birthday cake. The results where terrible!!  There was glare on all reflective materials and highlight over exposure.  Plus when trying to  focus on moving subjects in candle light you had better be ready to switch to manual focus.I found out that this lens is an old design and does not support E-TTL II flash photography and does not have the coatings the newer designed for digital photography anti-glare coatings or distance flash distance measurement system. What does all that mean for the person who bought this for natural light photography?  Nothing, it doesn't detract at all just know that the flash photography will not be anywhere near as good as that of the kit lens or any of the newer lens.Now, on to the good, this lens is great at natural light portrait photography on the cropped 1.6 Digital Rebel Body!!! On this camera it's now a 80mm lens, perfect for Portrait, with very nice Bokeh and good contrast.  Great for low light when you have to get a shot like this with no flash.On the other hand, it's not much good for anything else.  This field of view is too narrow with a cropped sensor for getting the entire scene and if you want their entire body you really have to back up.  It's also too narrow for scenic shots where you want people in the foreground and great wide scenic shots of places like the Grand Canyon where you would need something like 17 - 24mm.  It's also too short to be a telephoto lens.  Why do I mention this?  Because you will surly want a good zoom lens in addition to this lens Do NOT buy this as your only lens.  Buy it as a backup to a good zoom for when you need low light great Portrait or both.  Also know that you will be switching between the two during a shoot to get good portrait and wider angle shots.  In fact if you find yourself in a situation where you need to be versatile do NOT put this lens on your camera, it is not very versatile.  What do I mean by versatile?  Situations where you need to change angle of view or switch from natural to flash photography quickly.  Or shots where there is a lot of movement causing you to refocus your shot quickly.Bottom Line:  If you are cash strapped and want a great natural light Portrait lens to go with your Canon Digital Rebel then go with this lens.  If you have a little more money then you should go for the F/1.4 50mm lens which focuses faster has better build quality etc. and does the same job just better.If you can only afford just one do it all lens in this price range do NOT get this lens, get the 18-55mm kit lens  It's not as sharp in natural light but is all around a much more versatile lens and produces much better  flash photos.If you can afford $200 buy this 50mm F/1.8 lens and the 18-55 kit lens and use them together as a team.In closing over all I am pleased with the F/1.8 50MM lens when using it as a natural light portrait lens, but it's not as versatile as I thought it would be and I wonder if I should have saved up my money and waited to get the 50MM  F/1.4  lens which is a much better lens over all even if it does cost more then 3 time as much.  Now however I am hearing that the F/1.4 is having reliability problems with the auto focus and manual focus.  When shooting a wedding I can not use a lens I can not rely on.  I can rely on the F/1.8 to see me through and even afford a backup just in case I drop it again.3-28-2008 UpdateI now own the expensive and heavy Canon 85mm F/1.2 L II and Canon 135mm F/2 L lens for portraits and of course they blow this poor 50mm away.  But I still have a soft spot in my heart for this lens and for those on a budget or for those who are taking this lens into areas where you would not want to take an expensive lens I still heartily recommend the Canon 50mm F/1.8 II lens for the price it takes fantastic photos!Filter Update 3/28/2008After much searching I found the perfect filter. The Hoya Multi Coat HMC Pro1 Protection filter is not supposed to filter the shot just protect the front lens element. I was very worried that it would affect the shot after having tried some other premium filters like the B+W UV which caused the photos to be softer and duller. However, after some tests I found that in some weird way the Hoya Multi Coat HMC Pro1 actually makes the photos seem to have just a little more contrast and be a little sharper then without. I thought I had gotten the test shots backwards and had to retest with a little sign in the photo saying with and without filter in place just to make sure. Really amazing!!! I'm sold!7-4-2008 Update:My love of this lens continues.  Not long ago I took another short motorcycle ride with some friends and didn't want to risk my more expensive lens and camera.  So, I took my Canon Rebel XTi and 50mm F/1.8 lens.  I had forgotten just how great this little lens is.  You can take nice portraits with decent bokeh (some shots it's really good, but points of light show the 5 aperture blades producing 5 sided points of light).  You can vary the shot with F/1.8 giving you a creamy white super soft effect for the women and F/2.5 giving you less Bokeh but the sharpness you need for detail shots and male portraits.  The big plus for me as well is the weight. This is a combo you can carry all day long without killing your back and arms.At this low price how can you NOT own this lens?01-03-2009 Canon 5D Mark II Update:This lens which was pretty decent on the 40D and Rebel XTi comes completely apart on the 5D Mark II. No surprise since it's only $89. I guess the surprise was how well it works on a Canon 40D and Rebel XTi.If you have a cropped sensor camera I still recommend for the reasons listed in my review.  If you are using a full frame sensor camera like the 5D Mark II look elsewhere.Lenses I currently own:Canon EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS Zoom Lens Ultra sharp, great colors, great low light, poor zoom actionCanon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Rebel XTi Kit Zoom lens Muddy, slow, pile of junkCanon EF 17-40mm f/4 L Zoom Lens Fantastic colors, sharp zoomed 17 to 24mm and stopped down, ultra smooth zoom action, light weightCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8 L Zoom Lens Fantastic colors and contrast, sharp zoomed 40 to 70mm, zoom a little stiff at first, heavy, repair prone!Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Good budget portrait lens, light weight, disposable, sharp from F/2.5Canon EF 85mm F/1.2 L II The best portrait lens for female and children clients, buttery smooth Bokeh, heavy and expensive it shares sharpness with 135mmCanon EF 135mm F/2.0 L The best portrait lens for males and tied with Canon 85mm F 1/.2 for sharpest lens I own, buttery smooth BokehCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L Zoom Lens Fantastic colors, sharp for a zoom, very versatile ego boosting and attention getting and heavy!

"20070730","5.0","Best value for money Canon lens available.","I needed a fast lens that would be able to take pictures in low light conditions. My EF-S 17-85 was too slow without a flash and there were many times I either could not use or did not want to use a flash for a particular shot. I came across the EF 50mm f/1.8. As per many of the reviews it is cheap ($80), small, light and basically looks like a toy. Using a prime lens took a little bit of getting used to. There is no zoom. Your feet is your zoom. But the pictures it produces are very sharp. There have been many a time where I was able to take low light shots of people on the move without a flash that my 17-85 would never of been able to capture. At f/1.8 it is a little soft but bokeh is good but not great. I tend to use it more at f/2.8 - f/5.6 where it is sharper. Using ISO 800 or 1600 with f/1.8 or 2.8 you could take amazing pictures in low light conditions. It's a very fast lens. Auto focus is noisy and tends to hunt at low light. The manual focus ring is narrow, but after a while I get used to it.Value for money this is a 5 star lens. And it's a lot of fun to use, especially for those who have not experienced prime lenses. If I find that I need to replace this, I may opt for the more expensive 50mm f1.4 for it's build and superior bokeh. but for now. It's great!""

I use it mostly to take portraits of my children and since they are all over the place I don't mind moving along with them since this is a fixed lens.

I find it a little too long for what I normally shoot.Overall, it takes some very nice shots. I use this in churches that don't allow flash or tripods. It has saved me on more than a few occasions. Since it is a fixed focal length you have to crop your images afterwards to get the framing you really wanted. (Sometimes it is physically impossible to move to the position you need to be in to get the shot you want)It is soft wide open but starts to get very sharp from 2.8. Auto focus is pretty much useless in very low light. You have to switch to manual for these situations. One thing I don't like is that you cannot focus manually while auto focus is set to auto.One big plus is the lens is extremely small and light weight. Coupled with a Rebel XT you hardly feel like you are carrying anything around your neck.If you normally use zooms you will have to get in the habit of moving closer and farther from your subject. Your feet are now your zoom.Another big plus, it is only 80 bucks!!!

It's light and so small, I forget that I'm lugging my Canon 20D with me!  It's been nice for portraits while I am shooting 'senior'  portraits, weddings, and just random times with friend.

I asked him to tell me what I could possibly do to rectify the problem. He said buy a faster lens. I knew good lenses are expensive,except for the lens he showed me that would give me plenty of light to work with. Yep, the Canon f1.8 50mm prime lens. I thought, a lens this inexpensive wouldn't give me very good results but he told me he knew what he was talking about. I really wanted to buy the diffuser, so I went with the lens also. It was for Father's Day so I had to wait a week before using it. What a surprise! I read online reviews for that week, one after another all saying the same thing. A cheaply made inexpensive fast lens that gives you incredible results. Finaly, I got to use it at an engagement party.  All Day.  The only lens I used that day.  It lived up to it's reputation.

"20120123","5.0","Well-Suited for Classroom Pictures","There's a lot of other reviews out there by photographers far more knowledgeable than I, so I'll keep this little blurb simply about my experience with this lens.  I'm very new to DSLRs, and recently bought a Canon T3i because my old point and shoot (a Canon G10)was simply inadequate for taking pictures the way I needed to.  I teach autistic students, and enjoy taking candid pictures of all the fun things we do.  Unfortunately, using a flash in a classroom is very intrusive, and *not* using a flash results in many otherwise cute pictures being ruined because of blurriness.  So, I needed a camera that was better in the relatively low-light, fast-motion environment of a classroom.  Enter my new Canon T3i.  Even with the stock 18-55 lens, it was able to produce wonderful, clear pictures without a flash.But, after reading all the positive reviews of the nifty-fifty, I realized it may be even better-suited to my intended purpose.  And...it is.  The lens is very fast and sharp, and has yet to produce one blurred picture, even when the children are in motion.  I didn't find myself waiting for a movement pause to snap the picture anymore.  I just simply took the picture.  And, the narrow depth of field can produce an effect that makes pictures that look even that much more striking.So, given what I've experienced using this lens, I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to other aspiring photographers in similar situations.  Cheers!""

It's light, it's amazingly clear, and super cheap. I dont worry of beating it up but it doesn't because it stays in my pocket and it doesn't even have a hood so it stays small.

I am amazed at the sharpness and detail this little lens puts out.  At 1.8f it  creates some awesome clarity, bokeh, refined detail.  Perfect for intimate shots but also can be handy for wide angle use too,  just not very versatile and certainly not my first choice.

Some complain about it feeling 'cheap', but this feeling is minimized once it's on the camera. There is a tiny amount of play with the focusing ring (in autofocus mode) and I'm not expecting it to last a lifetime, but for the cost I heartily recommend this lens - especially for beginners / intermediates who rely on zooms. 50mm is a perfect 'all-around' length, and this baby is all you need!""
"20070614","4.0","Feels cheap, but produces where it counts.","Ok, let's be honest. This lens feels like a toy. Its constructed cheaply, there's simply no way to dispute that. However, the results it produces are anything but cheap. The 50mm is closest to what your eye sees and, therefore, should be included in any photographer's camera bag. The Canon version of this lens performs wonderfully despite the construction issues. From my experiences with the lens, it performs well in low light and its sweet spot seems to be at about f/11. The focusing ring is a bit awkward, though. The lens itself isn't long and because of that, manually focusing doesn't feel quite as comfortable as it does on other lenses. I take a star away from it simply for the cheap construction. However, for the money, the lens will more than pay for itself and lives up to the quality results that we've all come to expect from Canon lenses.""

Bounce some light onto your subject's face with a piece of white cardboard to eliminate shadows and totally forget about flash shooting. This is a FAST lens! Fast to auto-focus, fast at f/1.8 (and up) and fun to use. You'll pay more for a quality lens cleaner kit than you will for this lens. You won't regret buying this. If it ever breaks I'll immediately buy another. This lens and the Tamron 18mm-200mm f/3.5-6.3 AF Di-II LD Aspherical Macro are the only two lenses I own.

"20070613","5.0","Best value for any Canon lens","With this lens, you get what you pay for.  While for some people think that's a bad thing (mostly folks who think you should be able to get superb quality for dirt cheap), for me it's working out great.No, this lens isn't true USM, so it's noisy and the autofocus can be a bit unreliable, particularly in low light.  And it only has five aperture blades, so the bokeh isn't as creamy and smooth as it could be.  And yes, it's mostly plastic.  But here's the thing: it's under $90.  No other lens in Canon's line-up comes anywhere near that cheap.  The f/1.4 lens is hovering around $250, last I checked, and that's not even a full stop faster.If, like me, you're new to photography and are trying to learn as much as you can about creating beautiful pictures WITHOUT dropping $300 every time you find yourself in situation where your current lens collection won't do what you want, this lens is an absolute must-have.  With a focal length of 50mm, it's the equivalent of an 80mm lens on a film SLR or one of the large sensor DSLR bodies, which is just about the perfect focal length for portraits.  The f/1.8 maximum aperture means the subject is super-sharp and all the other distracting background stuff is blur, as it's supposed to be.  And best of all, you can now do quality indoor photography without spending a couple hundred bucks on an external flash that washes everything out anyway.Do I wish it focused better, faster, and quieter?  Sure.  Do I wish the aperture was 2/3 of a stop faster?  Of course.  Do I wish the body, or at least the mount, was made of metal?  Heck yes.  Would I like a shorter focal angle for wider indoor shots?  Definitely.  Am I willing, as a new photographer, to spend $350 on a lens that does some of those things?  Not yet, I'm not.If you're a professional wedding photographer and need a portrait lens for your Canon 5D, this is not the lens for you.  But if you just bought your first DSLR and the kit lens just doesn't do what you want in low-light or portrait situations, get this lens.""
"20070611","5.0","bang for the buck","I read it here before I took the plunge, but this lens is, by far, the quickest and cheapest way to improve the quality of your shots, particularly over what the XT or XTi kit lens can provide. Keep in mind, for beginning photographers, that a fixed 50mm lens means you are in a perpetual mini-zoom (imagine your kit lens - 18mm-55mm - zoomed most of the way in). That is certainly a moot point for this lens, though. A 1.8 aperture changes the entire ground floor for your shots. As dusk rolls in, you won't have to worry about flash-free shooting; this 1.8 will suck in light and even moving objects (assuming you are panning with them) can come out with significant clarity in the image. And indoors in the evening - wow - detail like you never thought possible will appear.The build quality is solid. Yes, it's plastic, but a robust plastic. The AF/MF switch is solid and the MF adjustments are very well-tuned. The 1.8 has become my default lens, partially because of its short size and therefore lesser weight.And the depth of field! I'm sure you can browse a few of the sample images above and see how amazing the depth becomes. Overall, there's no going wrong with a lens at this price and with these features.""

I'll cover the importance of this later.Build quality - 1.4 is way above in terms of build quality.IMPORTANT difference - 1.8 doesn't have manual focusing, 1.4 - yes.- wide-open apertures, vignetting is more marked in 1.8.- The color-tone in 1.4 is slightly better than 1.8- Bokeh is much more visually appealing than 1.8.Basically, in when using DOF to an advantage to highlight the focus-point, 1.4 produces much more visually applealing photos as the color tone of the out-of-focus regions are more appealing and the bokeh is also more rounded than it's sibling - 1.8 (primarily due to the larger number of lens elements)If you're primarily buying your FIRST prime lens and you wish to LEARN to use it without much attention to detail of the photograph (from a professional perspective as a possible seller photo) then I would recommend to first buy a 1.8 - learn to use it, get exposure/composition/etc. correct and then buy 1.4 or even better the BEST lens in the world of CANON - the famous L-series 1.2 (about 1200$)""

"20070425","5.0","great little lens","This is a great lens. If you don't have a comparable prime already and can spare $80, get one. It's fantastic for low light shots. The focus hunts in low light, though, and often it's hard to get it locked on in these conditions.For outdoors it's another story. Maybe it's better than the kit lens, I don't know, I've never tried one, but my Tamron 17-50 is definitely sharper at comparable apertures and it focuses faster (though louder!). Also this lens is a bit too long for a crop camera for a walk-around lens in my opinion. Canon 35 f/2 would be closer to a 'normal' lens, but having purchased a used one recently, I don't think it's worth $250 (new) for what you're getting. My advice would be look for a used one on ebay.Now quality. I know it's the cheapest lens in the Canon lineup, and I don't expect a sealed lens with a metal mount for this price. A plastic mount is probably better for such a light lens anyway. But it's a little off-putting when your brand new lens arrives with dirt inside. I returned the first copy because of that. It had huge pieces of lint inside that I couldn't shake off the front element. The second one also arrived with lint and dust inside, but lint was finer and I was able to shake it off. This may not make much difference optically and most likely won't show up in photos, but if you're particular about dirt in your lenses, this may drive you nuts.""
"20070416","5.0","A must have at twice the price.","After reading so many rave reviews about this lens, I figured I had to pick it up (it was $79 at the time from Amazon). I am new to the digital SLR world, but it doesn't take an expert to see the results. I have this mounted on my new Canon XTi and the pictures I get from this lens are what I bought an SLR for. Amazing sharpness, beautiful colors, nice bokeh (background bluriness), and a very useful focal length (the 50mm acts like an 80mm on the XTi, making it great for portraits). With the f1.8 max aperture, the flash never goes off outdoors, and I have yet to need to use the flash indoors despite never shooting beyond 400 iso. No, it isn't built like an 'L' lens, but it is also priced about 75% off the 'L' series it compares to. And the plastic construction isn't nearly as cheap as many reviewers make it out to be, while it has the bonus of adding almost no weight to your camera. At a couple hundred bucks, this would be a steal... at the going rate of under $100, it is a no-brainer.""

"20070406","4.0","Can't beat the price, but will it last long?","I bought the 50mm f/1.8 lens and the 35mm f/2 lens at the same time since I need faster lenses for shooting children indoors with little or no flash.  I have been using an older Canon zoom lens (f/3.5-f/4.5) with a flash but the results are not quite what I want.  I like the 50mm f/1.8 lens although it isn't quite wide enough for my Rebel XT with a 1.6x conversion factor.  I think the 35mm f/2 will be more appropriate (35mm x 1.6 is 56mm) but have not received the 35mm lens yet.  I am returning my 50mm f/1.8 because it has a small piece of debris inside the lens that cannot be removed by cleaning.  I would probably keep this lens otherwise, but now I have an excuse to try the 50mm f/1.4 lens depending on whether the 35mm f/2 is not what I need.  All in all, you can't criticize the 50mm f/1.8 lens when it is so inexpensive, but I'd like to know if this lens holds up over a long period without developing problems.  I'd rather fork over $325 for the 50mm f/1.4 or $225 for the 35mm f/2 lens than spend $75 on something that may only last a few years.""

I do portraits mostly and looking at pictures before and after this lens.. the difference is just amazing. This should be a staple lens for every photographer.It does feel built more cheaply than other lenses, but I shoot with it constantly and haven't had a single problem with anything falling apart/breaking/etc. A lot of people have also say that's it's very noisy but it really never bothered me.""
"20070312","5.0","Great lens... for the price","This was the first lens I bought to go with the EFS 18-55 that came with my Rebel XTi. I don't like shooting with a flash, so the max aperture of 1.8 really made a difference in low-light shots. Beside low-light shooting, full-open with this lens gave me the bokeh and narrow depth of field that I'd switched to a dSLR for.However, I've recently upgraded to the 1.4 for focus-related issues. I bought a few other lenses after the 1.8 and all of them had the Ultrasonic Motor. After using the USM it's hard to go back to the standard motor in the 1.8. It's a bit sluggish, and in low light it had a little trouble finding my AF points. Normally this would be time to kick into manual focus, but the focus ring is loose and a small movement goes a long way. Sharpness is not forgiving at wide apertures and the manual focus on this lens really makes it hard to be accurate by hand.In all though, this lens is truly a bargain, and in the world of photography bargains are almost nonexistent. I've taken some great pictures with it, and if you want something fast without shelling out serious money, this lens is just what you're looking for.""
"20070312","4.0","good cheap lens","I got into photography less than half a year ago. I have a Canon Rebel XTi, and bought it with the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, which is terrible by the way. At the time, I needed a cheap, fast (large aperature) piece of glass and the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II fit my needs very nicely.It is very cheap, and so don't expect the best quality here. It is very plasticy, but the good thing is that it is therefore very light and small. In combination with the small XTi, you won't need to lug around very much weight. Because it is a cheap lens, it lacks USM and is therefore very loud (annoyingly at times). It also lacks a full-time manual ring, and therefore one must switch out of Autofocus mode in order to manually adjust the focus. More expensive lenses will let you fine tune your focus without switching out of autofocus mode. It will also not tell you the distance at which you are focusing, like more expensive lenses. The switch between manual and autofocus is also cheaply made and relatively hard to push. Also, the back mount is plastic, and does not have a metal ring if that matters to you.All that said, it is a very good value since it costs almost one fifth of the price of the 50mm f/1.4. It performs surprisingly well for its price, and has in my opinion very good image quality and color saturation for its price. I have used it mainly for portrait shots, and I have been very satisfied with the results. Its focal length is good for portraits because it will keep the subject's body relatively in proportion. Additionally, its wide aperture means you get good background blurring. It only has 5 blades though, so when you stop it down you won't get as pleasing background highlights as you would with say the Canon 50mm f/1.4, which has 8 blades allowing for more circular highlights. Its  50mm focal length makes it easier to maneuver in tight spaces such as small rooms compared to a prime with a longer focal length, such as the Canon 85mm f/1.8. However, this would not be a good lens for group pictures, as one would need to stand very far away.In summary, this would be a good lens for those that are entering the realm of DSLR photography. I say this because those people who have been shooting for awhile will probably be more willing to spend money on a better quality lens such as the 50mm f/1.4 or the 85mm f/1.8. If I had the option between getting the 50mm 1.4 and the 1.8, I would go for the 1.8 again and save a lot of money. I have heard of some quality issues with the 1.8 and it falling apart, but I have had none so far in the half year that I have owned it, nor any indication that it will in the near future. You will get more than you paid for, as long as it lasts.Also, for those getting a new DSLR, I would highly recommend getting a body-only camera, buying this lens instead of the kit lens (since they are about the same price), and then saving up for a higher quality zoom like the Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8, or the Canon 17-55mm f/2.8 IS (which, by the way, is tres excellente). You will be much happier with the speed and image quality of a fast prime like this than with the sluggishness of the kit lens, although you will have to give up a significant amount of wide-angle flexibility until you get a higher quality zoom.Cons -poor build quality: cheaply made, lots of plastic -no full time manual or distance information -loud focusing motorPros -price, big bang for buck -image quality and color saturation very good -light weight and size -perfect focal length and aperture for some good portraits""

It may be constructed of 'plastic', but so are some of Canon's other Lens. One that comes to mind is the tele barrel of the 28-135mm IS [$400+/-]. AF focus motor sound does not seem loud compared to the aboved mention lens. But then I am sort of deaf. If you have a need/desire for a 'fixed' 1.8 apperature lens and 50mm will do the job, I don't mind recommending it.Cons: The lens shade is a Canon weirdity. Screws inside of the lens opening. Limits useage of different/multiple filters.""
"20070221","5.0","EF 50mm f/1.8","The 50 mm f/1.8 is a 'must own' lens for any camera that is suited to use it. I personally use it on a Canon Rebel Xt. For the price that it is at and the quality it produces it's a solid lens. It is great for indoor shots and for landscape shots. The f/ 1.8 allows for that nice blurry background in portraits. However, when there are more than 2 individuals within the closed space it can get tricky to shoot with this lens. I prefer to use it for individual portraits and wide landscapes.Pros:1.Cheap2.Great for Portraits3.Great indoors4.Great outdoor landscapes5.Nice bokeh6.CHEAP!Cons:1.Plastic2.Auto Focus has weird noise (common on this product)""
"20070220","2.0","super value, but incredibly fragile","I bought a Canon 400D (XTi) with the kit lens in October. This lens was my first addition to my kit. For portraits, it's super. You can snap away indoors without a flash because it's so fast. The narrow depth of field also makes for some super outdoor shots. And if you stop it down some, it's super sharp.Overall, just a great performer.[Later edit]My review above was published soon after purchasing this lens. I stand by my thoughts on the performance of the lens. It's awesome. However, the lens is so incredibly fragile that I have broken two of them (I dropped one, so I don't hold that against Canon). My second version of the lens broke through normal use. I think they made this lens out of tissue paper. I will be replacing the lens with something more expensive, but sturdier.""

You won't find a better lens to use for portraits, indoor photography or lightweight travelling at 6 times the price.

"20070207","5.0","Super Sharp Lens that's a Great Value","I am fairly new to photography, having just purchased an SLR about 3 months ago.  (canon digital rebel xti w/ 28 - 105mm lens).  I wanted to get into more macro photography, but didn't want to spend a whole lot of money before I knew if I liked it or not.  This lens fit the bill perfectly.It's a light weight prime lens that with the addition of a diopter set allows me to take some great macro shots.  The thing that really amazed me was how versatile it was.  I've actually used it for our product shots because the lens is incredibly crisp and sharp.  I can focus it much more sharply than the 28 -105 lens, picking up individual dots on printing.One note though, if you're going to do insect photography, this is not the lens for you.  The autofocus is incredibly loud, at least 10x louder than the ultrasonic focus on my other lens.  Other than that, it's great!""

"20070205","5.0","A great lens for baby pictures","I purchased this lens because I wanted something that could simulate the basic 50mm lens that my old faithful (film) SLR came equipped with.  In particular, I wanted a reasonably large aperture that would allow me to get the intimacy of close-in available-light shots of my new grand child.  This fills the bill perfectly!  The shots are crisply focused on the subject, but the narrow depth of field at close range with large aperture softens the foreground and background detail to turn a 'snapshot' into a portrait.  My family loves the pictures I've been taking, and I love this lens!  One of the best purchases I've ever made.""
"20070204","5.0","Great buy!","First EF lens I've ever owned. It's fast (considering I just upgraded from FD, basically), has great optics, works great as a portrait lens. I dispute claims that it's noisy, as it sounds quite silent next to the sound of my 20D's shutter.Unfortunately it feels like it came out of a cereal box. The lack of a metal mount makes me wonder. And I worry that my lens doesn't say 'MADE IN JAPAN'. Still, the day I got it it fell off my printer onto the floor, about a four foot drop, which it survived entirely without a scratch... we'll see how that goes. One major ergonomic disadvantage, apart from the fact that in your hands the lens feels like something that came out of the cereal box, is the fact that the focusing ring is, like, right at the end of the lens, and is easily turned while holding the lens. I don't have a hood yet, so I sometimes run into problems when I'm holding the lens.""
"20070201","5.0","Great inexpensive portrait lens, but must realize focal length limitation on 1.6 crop cameras","This review is lengthy, detailed, and honest, but it reflects my personal experience which will likely differ greatly from your own, so keep that in mind. This review is geared towards budget minded people (I am a university student after all) with 1.6x crop-sensor cameras, e.g. Rebel, XT, 20D, 30D, etc. who probably started out with the kit lens and now have outgrown it.This is an optically excellent lens at a truly bargain price. Particularly if you are going to this straight from the kit lens, you will be amazed and even shocked at the quality of the images this lens can produce compared to the kit lens.Low-light performance is excellent, with the large aperture (still incredibly sharp wide open) allowing wonderful low light flash-free photography which will greatly impress you, your friends, and your family after you photograph people candidly at your next gathering.This brings me to the focal length limitation. For what I just described, candid low-light photography at a party or other gathering, as well as candid shots of children and pets, this lens excels because on a 1.6 crop camera (such as the Digital Rebel series, which I imagine most people who buy this lens have) this equals approximately an 85mm lens in 35mm film camera terms. This is a classic portrait focal length, and so naturally it is perfect for candid portraits (as well as posed ones, of course) because it lets you get pretty close to people without sticking the camera in their face, as well as providing pleasing out of focus backgrounds with very sharp subjects. Canon also makes an 85mm f/1.8 lens which people who own the more expensive full-frame cameras love for the same reasons those of us with the 1.6 cameras love this one, because the focal length and large aperture are perfect for the sort of photography I've just described.It's not that it has no use besides that, though; I've taken many landscape and cityscape photos with this lens that are wonderful. But usually, I feel very closed in by the long focal length. If you're a long distance away from your subject, this lens can often be great for landscape and nature photography, but eventually you'll be longing for a wider field of view and will at least be tempted to go back to the kit lens for many shots, and for some you will absolutely need it.And this is its biggest problem, which is the flip side of this being a great lens for low-light social gatherings - even if you only use this lens for low light situations, you will feel like you need a wider field of view at least half of the time. To get a group shot of four or five people with this lens in a small house, I literally had to shoot from across the next room through the door, and that still wasn't quite wide enough. My only other option was to use the kit lens, which with its f/3.5 maximum at the widest focal length is just not usable for most low-light situations without a tripod or flash, so I had no choice.To reiterate, it is very likely that if you aren't already spending a lot of money on your camera and lens collection, you will really feel the limitation of not having a wide enough field of view for a lot of your photography. Depending on your style and what you mainly shoot, you could easily get very frustrated with this lens despite its strengths.The other thing that is likely if you're upgrading to this from the kit lens is that you will get addicted to the insane increase in picture quality and low-light usability and will not ever want to use the kit lens again, which means you'll need another higher quality lens that gives you a wider field of view. I used this lens more or less exclusively for about three months, became frustrated at not having a wider field of view, and ended up buying the $350 Sigma 30mm f/1.4 for its 'normal' ~50mm equivalent on my 1.6 crop camera, and for its large aperture. That lens is great, by the way, and I wholly recommend it instead of this 50mm lens if you've got the money. You do lose the advantages of the 50mm's long reach for portrait situations, but in general you can make up for this by getting closer to the subject, which admittedly is not always possible. Solution? Get both ;)Ultimate advice? If you've only got the kit lens and maybe a cheap telephoto zoom and you really don't want to or simply can't spend money on more expensive lenses in the near future, don't get this lens yet. Save your money up for a more versatile (and still optically excellent) lens in the $300-400 range, namely the 'standard digital zooms' offered by Sigma, Tamron, and Tokina in that price range. I am currently saving up for one of these (probably the Sigma 17-70, the least expensive of them, since the advantages of the others are covered by the 30mm and 50mm lenses).If you crave the low-light performance (which was what attracted me), and you really don't feel like you can spend $300 or more for something like the Sigma 30mm f/1.4, then go for it, but don't say I didn't warn you. You'll be craving more expensive lenses in no time.Another disadvantage that you won't notice too much unless/until you have more expensive lenses is the build quality. In terms of durability I'd say this lens is great and it will hold up to normal abuse, but it definitely feels like a plastic toy, the manual focus ring is only marginally better than the one on the kit lens (which is a joke), and if you care about this sort of thing, it looks a little awkward on the camera (I have the Rebel XT). It is the same size as the 50mm lens for my 1978 Canon A1, but since the body styling on these new cameras is so different from the classic camera body style this size and shape looks a little silly. It's purely a cosmetic concern, but don't be surprised if you feel a little self-conscious about using it in public (this won't stop you from using it, of course, because you'll know that the silly look of the lens has no bearing on the outstanding results you get).Finally, the autofocus motor is a little noisy, but if you're used to the kit lens you won't mind it because it's only slightly louder than that (just wait until you're spoiled by the silent and super fast ultrasonic motors on the more expensive lenses, though...) The focus accuracy is excellent, even in low light, but there's no avoiding that it will occasionally have to hunt for focus in very low light and while this is extremely annoying, there's really not much you can do about it even with the more expensive lenses and cameras.Overall - it is hard not to recommend this lens, but only if you get it knowing its limitations ahead of time and you are ok with it, and accept that it will probably make you want more expensive lenses to go along with it.Again - for the things it is best for (portraits and candids, kids, etc., though of course you can do a lot of creative things with it), you can't do better than this lens, especially on a budget (but, this lens compares extremely well with the much more expensive similar lenses!) What it absolutely is not, though, is a 'walk-around', general all-purpose lens that you can leave on your camera most of the time like in the film days when most people just had the 50mm f/1.8 lens that came with their camera and never took it off. The Sigma 30mm f/1.4 I mentioned fits that bill perfectly, if that's what you're looking for.""

I am trying to break into portrait photography and those two aforementioned lenses are not ideal for faces.  This lens, while definitely a bit louder when focusing, has made a world of difference.  Its ability to open up to f/1.8 has made it much easier when operating in a darker room, and because of the shallow depth of field created at that aperture you can get some really neat effects by focusing on one small area of your subject.  The last portrait session I did came out looking very professional and sharp.  I definitely recommend this lens--you can't beat the price and it is a must have for anyone taking people pictures.""

"20120115","4.0","Incredible lens for the money.","Yes, there are better lenses out there if you're a serious photographer. But for the money, this thing is an absolute steal. It is also very light and easy to carry around. I have multiple cameras with multiple zoom lenses, but I forgot the fun of a prime lens and the sharpness that you can get with it. And the speed. So I can't give it 5 stars simply because there are better and much more expensive lenses out there. But if this review was based on value, it would clearly be 5 stars.""
"20120115","3.0","Image Quality = 5 stars Built = 1 star","The image quality on this cheap $100 len is as good as the the $2100 canon 70-200 f2.8 IS. But there is a reason why it so cheap. The built quality is the cheapest of any len, even worst than the kit len 18-55mm. It super sharp if you take still object and people, but a no no with kids and moving objects. if you can, save for the 50mm f1.4. I really love this len but hated it as the same time. Frustrating bottom line !!UPDATE:After going back and review a year worth of pictures (about 10,000), I found that on the trips (Disney,zoo, aquarium, etc) and whenever I was using my 18-200mm. Over 90% of my pics are under 50mm on a 1.6x crop camera. Carrying the Canon 70-200 f2.8 IS is too heavy and not really good for landscape. I end up using the 50mm prime more than the expensive 70-200 f2.8 IS.Len Recommendations:The kit len 55-250mm is an excellent keeper for the less than 10% of the pics that need that extra reach. On a crop sensor, I recommend the Sigma 17-50 f2.8 OS for $640. It solid and compact and got much better reviews than the Canon 17-55 or Tamron. The Canon 24-70 $1,300 is excellent for full frame camera but on the crop it like 38-112mm which is far for landscape. The Canon 70-200mm is the sharpest of all zoom lens but price and weight is a real concerns. I would add the 35mm f1.8, 50mm f1.8 just because it so cheap, and the 85mm f1.8 for portraits.Conclusion:The cheapest lens combination : Canon 55-250mm ($170) Sigma 17-50 f2.8 OS ($640) and 50mm f1.8 ($100)  - This will cover 99% of all your needs for only $900  - Anyone new to DSLR should pick up these three lens first.  - 17-50mm f2.8 is a very nice, fast aperture len that will cover most everyday needs  - Portraits: $100 50mm f1.8 do fine then move up to the 85mm f1.8, excellent  - Last: if you need to replace the 55-250 for extra sharp images then go for the Canon 70-200 (f4 IS or F2.8 IS II)  - Both has about the same image quality  - f4 IS is half the price and weight of f2.8 IS II  - the only advantage f2.8 has is lower light and fast moving objectPS: I am taking my time to write this reviews mostly to help beginners. If money is not an issue, my reccomendation would be totally diffrent.""

"20070114","5.0","An irresistible value","As others have said, this lens absolutely can't be beat for the money. Yes, the build quality leaves something to be desired, and it's quite noisy when focusing, but the optics are crisp, contrast is great and the bokeh is smooth as butter. The build quality varies from lens to lens, but if you treat it gently, it should last a while. However, at $70 per, you'll probably be able to absorb the cost of a replacement if and when the time comes. In lenses, you usually get what you pay for, but this is one happy exception to that rule. Bottom Line: The price makes this lens a must-have for amateurs and professionals alike.""

If it was to break and I had to get another one, I would have paid the full price for it with no questions asked.This lens should be on of the first lenses on EVERY photographers list, unless you are a well-paid lawyer or a professional photographer than you can get the f/1.4 version of this lens and pay some $400 extra on it.Get the lens, it is good and clean, and you get a lot more than what you pay for.""
"20070114","4.0","Excellent results.  Great bargain","The pluses and minuses for this lens can be summed up in one word: cheap.Yes it's plastic and feels surprisingly flimsy - but it's an f1.8 lens for $75!  It's two stops faster than your f3.5 zoom. (In case that's confusing, it lets in four times as much light - meaning that you can shoot in much lower light with no flash).I don't want to spend $320 on the f1.4 lens right now, much less $1600 for the f1.2 L-Series.  I've used this lens to take so many crisp indoor portraits with creamily soft blur that I don't know if I shall ever get around to buying a more expensive lens.For creative low light photography, this is the best $75 you'll ever spend.""

It still looks great with the flash too.  It's also great for portraits, I would recommend this for everyone!""

It is also noisy when it focuses. Manual focus is possible, but the focusing ring is very narrow at the front of the lens, so it's not the most comfortable thing to do.Definitely a very good buy, especially as a learning lens.I use it with Canon 5d.""

Put this lens on your camera turn the ISO up to 1600 and watch yourself be able to shoot at night on street corners without a flash. Its small unobtrusive and coupled onto a camera such as the Rebel Xt it allows you to be very discrete and non existent when shooting street portraits.This lens does have its downfalls, the focus is very picky and needs to be spot on.  Sometimes the gearing doesn't allow the camera to focus right where it needs to be and you need to refocus in manual to get the shot right.  Its also quite soft compared to lenses such as the 28-135 or the 24-105 L IS,  of course though with an aperture range of 1.8 this lens will still be taking photos well after the other lenses run out of options.I could talk all day about why you need one of theses lenses, if you are interested in artistic photography get this lens you will not regret it!""

But nothing to worry about, I've been using it for quite a while and no dust has gotten inside.My only complaint is the focusing and AF. This is very slow, specially in lowlight.

Indoor portraits are phenomenal.  You will get used to stepping back to fit people in, and it's worth it.

Given it's price and utility (especially if you like to take pictures of people as opposed to nature, objects, landscapes, etc.), there's no reason to not consider it.

When the action is really on I draw out one of my other lenses. The build quality is embarrassingly weak. I have read several reviews about the lens falling apart, and sadly I could believe that. One bad bump, one hard jostle and it could spell the end for this lens.""
"20061022","5.0","best lens for the price","When I purchased this lens, I was skeptical.  I had read many reviews critical of the build quality (plastic mount) and af (not USM).  I would have preferred to go with the f/1.4 USM or the f/1.2 L, but could not afford to do so at the time.  I know that a poor lens is no more useful than a paperweight, but despite the slower speed and cheaper build quality, I decided to give this lens a chance.I'm very happy that I did.  AF is fast, if not completely silent, and while this lens is not as well constructed as many of the other lenses Canon makes, I have taken thousands of pictures with it and have been very happy overall.  With my 400d, it's reasonably sharp at 1.8, and very sharp at 2.5.  If you're a professional photographer (if you make more than 80% of your income with photography) go with the f/1.2 L.  If you're a serious amateur with extra cash, go for the f/1.4 USM.  But if you don't have the money for more expensive lenses, you should be very happy with the f/1.8.  It performs almost as well as the other two, for a fraction of the cost.  If you decide to upgrade later, you can sell the f/1.8 -- even 5 or 10 years from now you can expect to get 75% of it's initial value by selling it used online.This is an excellent lens.  You will not be disappointed.""
"20061019","5.0","The Standard-Bearer for Inexpensive Lenses","This should be the standard by which all EOS lenses are judged - and in particular, the inexpensive ones. The standard in picture quality, that is. Sharp as a tack all the way down to 1.8, the pictures it can produce are nothing less than amazing. If it's your first EF lens, you'll be hooked. If you have the kit lens, this should be your next purchase.One problem mentioned by nearly everyone is the build quality. For $80, it's hard to expect an L lens, but you should be able to expect more than this. I'd rather see it cost $100 and have the increase go to a better build, but Canon hasn't asked me. I bought mine used, from what I understand was the second owner and it's working just fine. I don't feel it will fall apart or break anytime soon, but my 24-105 is on most of the time. If this is going to be your primary lens, you should consider the 1.4.That said, every owner of an EOS should own this lens. It can be the gateway to truly spectacular photos.""

Well for me, it was the affordability of owning this great piece of plastic. My dad, after seeing the pics, wants the USM version for the long term.

I have been able to shoot handheld indoors, handheld with just ambient lighting, all to outstanding results.  The f/1.8 aperture allows for some great low light shooting and extremely shallow DOF.  For less than $80 all Canon owners should have one (unless they've already opted for the 50mm f/1.4)  I will be looking to Canon soon for a 70-200L lens, but this one certainly will cover the 'normal' length for me.  Build quality seems good, it IS plastic anyway, so it will feel 'plasticky'.Extremely light, small, and fast, you can't go wrong with this lens.""
"20060818","5.0","Great value for money","I have recently taken to photography as a hobby and Canon rebel XT is my first ever camera. So I just needed a few cheap lenses to experiment and learn. After reading various forums, I decided to go for the Canon 50mm f/1.8 and a Tamron 70-300 LD Di (this one hasn't been shipped to me yet). If you just own the kit lens (like me), I would definetely recommend the Canon 50mm. It helped me discover the world of low light photography. The picture quality is amazing. Focussing is very fast. Definetely a star lens by my standards.""

After minimal use, dust has already appeared INSIDE the surface of the lens. There's no way to clean it off. (I always use both end caps when the lens is not mounted.) I can only think the cause is poor weather sealing.Great pictures and glass, but the cheap cost means a cheap build quality, no USM, and a 5 blade aperture.""
"20060814","4.0","Great lens, but beware the build quality ...","On the one hand, this is a great lens for the money. I'd blow off the crummy zoom that ships with the kit Digital Rebel XT and buy this one instead. I use it for 80% plus of my family pictures, with my Rebel XT APS-sized sensor it's a compact portrait lens.On the other paw, I dropped the camera. The lens might have hit first. The next day it wouldn't come off the camera. I forced it off (bad move) and found the inner ring of the lens had broken. This prevented the lens from full disengaging. My forcing it off may also have damaged the camera, though at this time the one retracted contact pin is again working and the camera seems to have survived.So .... there's a downside to cheap build quality other than the lens itself coming apart. It could damage your camera.Bottom line, don't put this on a >$1000 body. I bought another because I didn't have time to shop, but I think I may end up getting the 1.4 instead.""

I  now find myself keeping this lens on the camera and going to the zoom mainly when I need a wider angle. The images from this lens are so sharp, and the lens is so fast, that by cropping and enlarging I can get image quality that is very competitive with the zoom at 85mm.Another thing: if you want to stitch several images together to create a panoramic image, this lens works great - far better than trying to use a zoom lens.It'd be a mistake to pass up this lens because it's cheap.

It produces a nice perspective on human features (as a small telephoto does), but is a bit long for cramped quarters (like shooting a crowded wedding reception).Be aware that the reason for the nice light weight is that this lens has a plastic body.

"20060713","4.0","Very good for the price","My own opinions on this lens are very similar to what I have read elsewhere, viz., that it is a very good lens for the price.  Testing showed the first lens I got to be pretty soft, especially around the edges and especially at f/1.8 and f/2.  I returned it and Amazon very graciously sent me another which was better.  In summary I would say that at f/4 and above it is really quite sharp, and you have the higher speed if you need it.  Stick to the center of the lens (at the higher apertures) if you can.  Not the best lens in the bag, but not too shabby either.rps""

I'm glad to have purchased it - without doubt!""
"20060702","5.0","Until the Real Thing Comes Along","Unless you already have a top-quality fixed lens around this length (and Canon makes no L-series in 50mm) I can't understand why you don't own this.  It's so cheap.  It's fast and sharp.Eventually, every photographer needs a fixed lens at somewhere around this focal range.  I favor zooms for telephoto: it's hard to quickly shuffle on foot between a 70mm and 300mm focal range.  I also like zooms for wide angle: you can grab a big landscape or group shot, then a person in close-up, all of which makes a wide-angle zoom a good 'walkaround' lens, especially for travelers.  The 'middle range' between, say, 35mm and 100mm is portrait-range, and a great opportunity for the extra precision and handiness of a prime lens.Prime lenses usually generate better images at every price point, and the EF 50mm f/1.8 II is no exception.  In fact, on a ratio of image quality to price, this lens may be unmatched.  Images are sharp and have nice contrast and color.  At faster speed, indoor shots without flash are easily possible at reasonable lighting levels.  This is crucial for those of us without high-end flashes and who rightly abhor built-in flashes, or flashes in general.  The speed (and, again, the clarity) of this lens makes it an obscene bargain.  See the peachfuzz on your baby's cheek?  Get it; no flash.  It's also disposable: you can take greater risks because replacement costs are relatively low.Buy this, at least as a holdover, until you get L-series glass for your portrait range prime lens.""

You can now do those existing light photos and get the colors the way you see them, not yellow or green because of the light source indoors!This lens is very good optically.

Overwhelmed by how awesome this lens is for the price. I bought the Rebel T2i at Christmas for pics of our forthcoming baby, but I found that the kit 18-55 lens very underwhelming for portrait photography (understandably now). It's hard to believe that the images produced by this lens came from the same camera. Other than the delightfully narrow depth of field, the performance in low light is amazing with the large aperture. This lens has not left the body since purchase and I even find myself using it for landscape shots too. If you're on the fence about this, just get it! The lack of IS has not been an issue at all for me - I guess the larger aperture means it can shoot pics at faster shutter speeds to compensate. Also, the older AF mechanism does not even seem much louder than the latest USM system on more expensive lenses. At the moment I simply find myself running this lens in 'Av mode' with the aperture ramped right up and the camera choosing an appropriate shutter speed. Amazing.""

"20120110","5.0","Good photos","My daughter's friend is a professional photographer doing weddings, portraits, etc and when she got started she told a friend she was going to have to get a better camera that the photos weren't as good as she thought she should get.  She has a Canon EOS Rebel XS and they explained it wasn't the camera but the lens and suggested the EF 50mmf/1.8II.  She loved it and uses it on most shots.  So when I was looking for another lens I checked this lens out and read many reviews and decided to go ahead and purchase this one 'last'(LOL)lens.  I got it before we went to visit family at Christmas and couldn't be more pleased. The shots were clear and sharp and if I had had time to practice more I am sure the shots would have been even better.  I am a novice and do not ever plan to be a professional but just want to do some really nice shots for me.  I use point and shoots just for fun but my iphone does just about as good and use my canon for those nice set up shots or nature shots.I read many reviews and agreed with most of them.  The lens is light but not cheap feeling to me and is my most used lens.  I use my big telephoto zoom lens for nature shots as we live in Colorado and the shots are amazing if you wait for them.  I have the 18-55mm that came with the bundle I bought with the camera but don't use it much.  I had friends try the lens on my camera during the holiday and they all love it as well and they all have other DSLR cameras too.If you want sharp good photos then this is the lens.  I keep it on my camera almost all the time and since it is so light I use my DSLR more than ever.  The bigger lenses are heavy for me to use constantly due to my RA but this smaller lens is just right.It arrived on time and in excellent condition.  Love it, love it, love it.""
"20120109","3.0","Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 lens","I'm an amateur photographer [who happens to take a heck of a lot of photos] and I bought this lens to use on my Canon EOS Rebel DSLR camera.I'm not too terribly happy with this lens, but I did not expect the moon for $100.00.  On auto focus it never quits jerking back and forth and settle down to a firm focus unless you're in full sun-light. Even in full sunlight it can take its sweet time to focus. It feels flimsy -  poorly made.  But again, for $100?  I've since turned the auto focus off and just use manual focus all the time. I don't know if the lens is a lemon or if all of them would turn out the same way if I replaced it.  I think it probably the latter.  Other than that, I ordered the lens for portraits and it takes very sharp - clear photos.  Maybe too sharp as I've had complaints that every blemish or wrinkle in the face shows up in the photo.  I like the wide aperture setting for blowing the backgrounds out behind the subject- but care has to be taken that you have enough depth of field set so all of your subject shows up clearly.With all that said, I'm still happy [for now] that I ordered the lens and that I have it in my bag.  If the auto - focus worked as it should, I would probably give it another star or two in the rating. If I happen to break this lens somehow, I will probably just put together another two hundred dollars or so and order the EF 50 mm f/ 1.4.""

"20060607","5.0","Excellent value for the money","If it's price tag was higher - I wouldn't give it 5 stars due to the poor construction and AF performance. It's just plasticky and misses focus in low light. Not a good match for users who put their dSLRs and lens through rough use, but for a more relaxed user of Rebel or 20d/30d this is a nice pick.If you look past the build quality (and you should) this little lens packs a punch. I got this since I don't like to use flash and like to shoot in low-light - decided to try a prime and this was an obvious pick.I've got a good copy - sharp even wide open at 1.8, providing you get the focus correct, since DOF is very shallow and the lens does have some focus field curvature.Users who mention softness wide open probably use the 'focus-recompose' technique , which is not a good idea with such a large aperture since your focal plane will shift. You should always frame the shot with the correct AF point.Wide open it has less contrast, but that tends to work well for portraits. At f/8, it's remarkable.All in all, I'm happy with it.""

Can use faster shutter speeds to stop the action while the 1.8 aperture lets in enough light to get the correct exposure without having to crank up the ISO.  Only one complaint: feels like it's made out of cheap plastic.  Have been using it for a couple of months now and don't think it will fall apart if it's taken care of but I would prefer it to have a more solid feeling.  But then I guess it wouldn't be so cheap, either.  I still definitely recommend it.""

My only issue with this lens is that the Manual / AF switch was a bit difficult to slide.  The lens seems to take very clear pictures and the boken seems to be very good.""
"20060504","4.0","A "gateway" lens...","Pros: Absolutely no better way to get started with prime lenses short of finding a used EF 50mm f/1.4; it's fast, it's light, and it'll teach you about depth of field and bokeh. It'll make you focus with your feet, and getting closer WILL improve your images.  If you get a good one--and I received a good one first time out--the autofocus is fast and locks in tight.  And if something goes horribly wrong (slip, crash, tinkle), you can buy a new one with very little heartburn.Cons: With the sensor factor, it's effectively an 80mm lens, so it's not really 'normal,' it's made of plastic, it can be soft when it's wide open (the focal plane is vanishingly small at f/1.8), and it seems to be subject to some quality control issues in manufacturing.  If you have big, meaty fingers, it can be difficult to find the ring when you want to focus manually.I bought this thing as an affordable experiment: it's been a happy little surprise because it's a damn fine bit of glass. I find myself reaching for it a lot, especially for close-up work.  Now, the only thing holding me back from more primes is that pesky money issue.""
"20060426","4.0","Excellent photo quality, durability good so far","Ive been shooting with this lens in my bag for a few months - sometimes it even ends up in my pocket.  I havent had a an issue with durability yet.  The lens has great clarity at the midrange F stops for its price, especially on a digital with a cropping factor.  Any lens can have aberrations at the minimum F stop - yes even the 'L' lenses - it just gets less noticable as the price goes up. the question you should ask is how much am I willing to spend to get that small increase in quality?I dont think that I will have an issue with the durability as some other reviewers have - mostly because I try not to abuse my camera.If you are putting this on a Rebel XT then realize that although the Rebel has great features, it is NOT a Pro body with dust and weather seals, an alloy metal outerbody, etc.... and anything that will damage the lens will most likely damage the body too.  ALWAYS use a filter - UV, clear or haze to protect the glass, and it will protect the end of the lens barrel too.If you bought the Rebel XT because you wanted great and sometimes incredible photos at a great price, then buy THIS lens too!  If you bought the 5D then you can afford the all metal 50mm 1.4, and send me your hand-me-downs!Pros:  excellent optics for the price, small, light and fast.Cons:  50mm is actually a little long for the 1.6 factor - I havent used it as much as I thought I would.  Plastic body will not take Pro level abuse - should be fine for average or above average user who sometimes puts stuff back in the camera bag.Recommended based on value.  Even with the 1.6 factor making it longer - I like having it around at this price...If you have a Rebel XT save the extra money from the 50mm F1.4 and buy the Opteka Battery grip, an extra battery, another CF card and some good filters.""

Not quite fast enough for stage performance work, but it was the fastest lens in my bag.  After borrowing his 50, I was shocked at the plastic housing construction and the tiny focus ring.  All of that bias disappeared as soon as I took some test shots and examined them on my PC.  This lens is a real jewel producing acceptable bokah and color depth.  I find that I use it quite often and the featherweight allows me to keep it in my bag without adding much weight.  In most low light situations, the slight light fall off toward the corners is unnoticeable.

I cannot imagine a better lens for the money.And worst case, if the lens breaks, I can buy two more before I've come to the total that I would have put into the f/1.4 cousin.I highly recommend this lens.UPDATE 02/2010: After almost 5 years with this lens, it finally bit the big one... literally. First, my wife dropped it onto a wooden deck from chest-high. Other than a scuff on the plastic, no issues with the function of the lens. 2 weeks later, my dad dropped the lens out of my unzipped camera bag (DOH!). The drop didn't kill the lens, the night outside being used as a chew toy for 2 giant schnauzers did.  Bottom line, I stand by my original fervor for this lens. I might personally upgrade to the f/1.4 because I do like to work in very low-light and I occaisionally wish I had just a little more lens speed. But I am certainly teetering because I know how good this lens is.  Happy shooting!UPDATE 12/2011: After a long hiatus, Santa Claus hooked me up with my second copy of this lens. It is just as good as the original.It is still taking wonderful nature shots and is the lens that most often makes people smile when they see the photographs it takes.""

I would recommend it to anyone who wants more than the basic lens that comes with your camera, but can't afford the even better l-series lenses yet. It works nice indoors as well because of the 1.8f stop. Its also very lightweight for people who don't like carrying alot of extra weight in equipment on them.""
"20060311","3.0","3 years later","I initially gave this lens 5 stars, but am now moving it down to 3.Long story short, while the lens certainly is a fantastic value and should be part of any beginning photographer's kit, it has some shortcomings that become annoying over time.First off, it is flimsy and will break easily. You probably know this by now though. Another issue is focusing. It is slow to focus, and will hunt until eternity in dark light. Lastly, it is very small. This might not be a problem for some, but when you put it no a large body, or a a body with a grip attached, it becomes very uncomfortable to hold.Image quality is still good, as well as color rendition (if you're getting weird colors, learn how to use your camera's white balance settings). It is sharp, even at f1.8, though it shines when you stop down a bit.Lastly, Bokeh is ok. I liked it at first, but compared to other primes, the bokeh is pretty dull.I bought this lens for $85 3 years ago and the price has been hiked since. If you're looking for a good prime and have a little extra cash, I'd recommend Canon's 85mm f/1.8 instead.""

Ever since I bought this lens, this is the only lens I use for the portrait shots.So easy to use. The only thing you have to do is to change the aperture per number of people.  Remember, it's pretty much wide open and at 50mm fix focal length, so, when you shoot more than two people, even if they stand back to back, one of them will be much blurry.  Here's what my experience told me:1.8: 1 person2.0: 2 people side by side2.5: 2 people back to back2.8: 3-5 peopleYou don't really have to buy the 50mm f/1.4.  This lens will do the same job.

"20060227","5.0","A Lens for (Nearly) Everyone","When I first made the switchover to SLR photography from point & shoot, I debated over several lenses to accompany the camera's kit lens.  The EF 50mm f/1.8 lens is often described as a 'must have' lens for new photographers, so I gave it a shot.  I must say, I've been very pleased.Pros:f/1.8 Aperature:This lens is 'fast' in that it has a very wide maximum aperature (f/1.8), meaning it lets through more light and can thus take photos with a faster shutter speed than a 'slower' lens.  A wide aperature also allows for very shallow depth-of-field (and thus a lot of background blur).Because of the wide aperature, the lens is useful both for lower-light conditions--allowing you to still shoot at fast enough shutter speeds to permit handholding and often without having to add a flash--and for portraiture in well-lighted conditions, in which the background will be blurred.Cost:How many lenses of reasonable quality can you find for under $100?Cons:Focal Length on Digital SLRs:For the digital SLR user, unless you're using a full-frame camera, the crop factor of the APS-C sized sensor will make this lens more in the range of 80mm and thus a medium telephoto rather than the 'normal view' 50mm that many film shooters are expecting--so keep that in mind.Autofocus:The autofocus is not Canon's USM system and is thus a bit slow and noisy, and it requires the use of a small switch to change over to manual focus (no full-time manual focus).  Sometimes, the lens seems to 'stick' in manual focus after being switched there and then back to auto, requiring a dismounting and remounting of the lens to get it working right again.Minimum Focusing Length:This is not a macro lens and thus cannot focus at extremely close range, although I've successfully used it as such with the 'poor man's macro' screw-on magnifying lenses.  The loss of quality in doing so has not been a problem for me, anyway.Build Quality:Make no mistake--the lens' cheap price is reflected somewhat in its build quality, although the optics themselves seem to be fairly good.  The lens may feel 'cheap,' and probably would break if dropped, but at the price, one could easily afford to replace it.Summary:Overall, I'm quite pleased with this lens and am glad to have purchased it.  I tend to use it for pet and human portraiture and have also used it in a pinch for macro photography of flowers and in low-light conditions indoors.""
"20060226","5.0","Dollar for Dollar it cant be beat.","I have a decent variety of lenses, but when I have low lighting or an abnormal situation, I know I can count on the 50mm 1.8 to do the job, with stunning clarity.The only major downfall to the lens is the clanky noise it can make when focusing. This noise isnt horrible but can be a bit annoying during a quiet dance show or concert. As far as build quality it could use a metal mount and maybe a little more durabilty, but at the price point you can afford to buy two or three and have them around just in case.Dollar for dollar though this lens is the best lens I own.

It turns out it's also very simple to use because you can't even fiddle with the zoom since it has no zoom!So armed with this lens and an indoor performance, I took a bunch of pictures, one-handed, on my Digital Rebel XT, and I ended up with some of the nicest pictures (indoor or out) that I have ever taken:  http://payne-family.org/ISTP%20CNY%20Performance%202006/Most of the pictures are very sharp, none of the pictures were taken with a flash.The only problem is 50mm is really 80mm if you use a digital SLR with the typical 1.6 multiplication factor. So it's no good for some situations.

Rarely found in a lens at this price.3) Excellent price, which leads to a great value.I'd wish for (even if it costs more):1) More solid construction, as mentioned elsewhere,2) A USM motor - the lack of which means this lens is slower to focus & a bit louder compared to Canon's USM lenses, and3) Full-time manual focusing ability.  (The USM motor would fix this too.)Every photographer should have a 'nufty fifty.'  For the price, this lens should be in every EOS shooter's bag.""

In the low light that this lens exceeds, the autofocus is useless.  Just an aside about the wide aperture, it's very tough to focus on a close subject in low light.  The depth of field is so narrow and detail is difficult to make out.  I usually end up 'bracketing' my focus.  Anyway, buy it...what the heck!""
"20051231","4.0","canon ef 50 mm 1.8 ii","i believe you but this lens is'nt plastic because is some polimer ;because the lens is no moving inside is very crisp""
"20051230","4.0","Excellent Value","I've had the 50mm f1.8 for about three months now, so I wanted to put in my two cents worth after a little field use.  What originally attracted me to this lens was, obviously, the price.  It is very, very inexpensive.  This is likely due to the fact that the housing is, unlike its predecessor the Mark I, entirely plastic.  That initially put me off, but after seeing some images posted that had been taken with this lens (and after seeing the prices of the f1.4 and the used mark I)I decided that I really had nothing to lose.  There are, as with most lenses good and bad elements to this lens.  Lets start with the bad.Keep in mind that if you are shooting a canon DSLR (as I am) this 50mm lens actually behaves as an 80mm lens, so it isn't that terribly wide.  The fact that it is functionally 80mm can make framing shots a bit difficult.  This is definitely a secondary lens and really isn't that appropriate for a 'walking around lens.'  At least it isn't for me, as I tend to prefer shooting wider angles.If you have some sort of mishap with your camera, like dropping it, you can likely kiss this lens goodbye.  I have fortunately never had to test this, but I imagine that it wouldn't stand up to any sort of impact very well.  The flimsiness of the build is very obvious when compared to some of the older canon lenses.  MY 35-135mm USM is about 10 years old, and has a metal chassis.  These lenses can often stand drops and still operate.  This is not so for the 50mm mark II.Since everything but the glass is bare bones, the autofocus isn't terribly fast.  If all you have ever worked with is USM lenses, you will have to be ready to take a little more time focusing.  If you have experience with the 18-55mm kit lens, you will find that it is about the same.All that being said, you are probably wondering why I rated this lens at four stars instead of, say, three.  That's because there are a lot of nice features to this lens that far outweigh the bad.If you have never used a prime lens before (meaning, a 'fixed' lens that doesn't zoom) then you are in for a pleasant surprise.  It is far more expensive to build a quality zoom than a quality prime, thus decent zooms tend to cost a mint.  Also, zooms are only at their best in the middle of their range.  The 50mm doesn't move, and so has been optimally designed for its focal length.  Shots are sharp at all aperture ranges; shots at medium apertures (f8-f11) will blow your mind.  Really.  Search the web for some images made with this lens in those ranges and you will buy it.  Resistance is futile.  Canon may have skimped on the body, but they didn't cut corners on the glass.  It is excellent.The wide aperture (f1.8) is really outstanding as well.  I had never really worked with a lens this fast before because, frankly, I hadn't been able to afford to.  You dispense with your flash and handhold at levels that you would not have thought possible.  And once you get away from flash use during night/lowlight photography, you will see some truly amazing colors that flash typically obliterates.The fact that it is fixed, and not too wide, forced me to be a little more creative than I normally would when framing shots.  When I went to Burma this year, I left my principal lens at my hotel, and didn't realize it until I was far away, so I was forced to use the 50mm as my principal lens.  Some of my favorite shots of my whole trip actually come from that day, as I was forced to come to terms with the focal length limitations of the lens.And finally, there is the price.  A lens with glass this good that costs less than a filter setup, or a dozen 8x10 prints?  How can you say no?  Unless you have the bucks to spend on the f1.4 or the Mark I, this lens belongs in every EOS shooters bag.""
"20051229","4.0","Great lens, even better value!","Alright, first let me give you my opinion regarding some of the qualms I've read around here:* Yes, the lens might not be of the best build quality; however, judging solely based on optics and picture quality I can hardly justify spending 10X as much money in an L-series equivalent of this lens. I've used both and unless you're an ultra-professional juggernaut, I really doubt you'll notice the difference (image-wise) between this great lens and the much more expensive version.* Yes, it's not f/1.4 as the $600+ version...it's a whooping fractional step slower (f/1.8) for ~ 10X less money.As for what this lens actually is:* Great, inexpensive prime lens.* Great optics (good enough to use it in a portrait studio).* Inexpensive enough to be able to take risks with it.What this lens isn't:* A lens geared towards ultra-pros looking for absolute perfection.* A ruggeed, work-horse, durable lens.* A miracle that will make anyone a better photographer.* The best thing since diced ham.In summary, great lens, absolutely outstanding value and a must for portrait amateurs and enthusiasts. No wonder they call this lens 'Canon's Nifty Fifty.'""

Great for portraits, indoors or any time you need a relatively fast lens (compared to the kit lens) with very good sharpness and clarity.""
"20051228","5.0","Best Value in Photography!","Wow! My theory now is that Canon doesn't put this baby as their kit lens because many people would decide that they DONT NEED ANOTHER ONE! And many of them would be right!Like others, I bought the Rebel XT and the 28-135 IS lens. The 28-135 is heavy and priced like a gold brick. I guess it does OK, and I do keep it mounted most of the time.And like others, I stumbled on this lens somehow, read the raving reviews, and for the price figured, 'What the heck?'This lens in tack sharp. It shows the fire in the colors you photograph. The wide aperture means candles can be excellent lights for portraits. Its narrow field is great.There are pitfalls though. I snapped a pic of my face at arm's length using autofocus a while back and (1) the focus locked on the tip of my nose and my face was already blurring (2) the lens was so sharp that I saw blackheads clearly on my nose tip I can't really see in the mirror (doh!). I've read that dSLR images are slightly soft to aid in later editing. I can only imagine what it would do on a film camera.Yesterday while camping I slapped this lens on. Unlike the 28-135, this one is light enough that I didnt notice I was carrying a camera everywhere. At night I put the lens on the top of the car pointed at the sky, set the shutter for 15 secs, and hit the button. Much to my amazement, the lens not only showed hundreds of stars that were invisible to my eyes, but it also found a galaxy. That pic is on the customer image section of this page. You can see what I saw, but the smaller size doesnt do the lens justice.One quirk of Amazon is that this page keeps alternating pictures of lenses. This lens does not have the distance focus scales on the outside of it.Zoom is nice for many things. But where zoom isnt necessary, performance is very, very nice. Performance at $70 is almost too good to be true.Let me close by repeating what has been said elsewhere and will continue to be said here....IF YOU OWN A SLR, STOP NOW AND GET THIS LENS!UPDATE 12/06 I have owned this lens for about a year now. Over that time I have immersed myself in photography, workshops, books, tests, etc. I have since upgraded to the 30D and a couple of L lenses, and now have a portfolio strong enough that I am now getting dollar signs thrown at me that I didnt even see coming. I say all this to give you some perspective on what I will write afterward.Now that Ive really learned the difference, I can agree with others that it is a tad soft wide open, but that is to be expected. I read a lens test recently that put the 1.8 against Canons heavweight L glass, and, not surprisingly, the L beat out the $70 plastic wonder in most categories. What might surprise you, however, is that when the lens was tested at F 8 it BEAT THE L GLASS in sharpness! As one that has felt the pain of trading large sums of money for L glass, I appreciate affordable quality...not something anyone can plan on seeing much of in photography.My 28-135 has since joined my kit lens in the garage. The 1.8 is still in my case with my newer 30D.With some experience under my belt I now would make the following recommendation. Right now, as you read this,  you may have an idea if you've been bitten by the photog bug. You may know that this beast is going to morph into something more than a simple pasttime. If you look inside the depths of your aspirations and you know that you are going to be a serious amateur, bite the bullet and get the 50mm 1.4. Trust me on this one. Eventually you'll end up getting it anyway, so just apply the $70 to the 1.4 now.If you're just exploring different areas of SLR photography, you cant go wrong with this lens. Case in point- as of this writing the baby in pink in the customer images section of this lens is one of the top-ten rated images of all pics uploaded on Amazon! This lens will allow you to dazzle friends and relatives used to snapshots from point & shoots. It will be the start of what you upgraded to a DSLR for in the first place. For you, the 1.8 is still, by far, the best value in photography!""
"20051222","5.0","Great Value For Money","I have to admit I wasn't planning to get another lens for my Rebel XT after the 28-135mm IS USM, however I stumbled across a couple of reviews for this lens that raved about the optical quality and one look at the price I figured that it was worth a look.After opening the box you find a rather unremarkable looking plastic barreled lens. However looks can be deceiving and underneath the plastic lies some remarkable optics that will outperform lenses five times the price. At 50mm it makes a good fixed length general purpose lens, but it excels at portrait photography as the narrow depth of field makes it easy to blur out backgrounds to bring out the subject in the foreground. The wide aperture makes shooting in low light practical, so its great for indoor work where you don't want to use a flash. I find myself using this lens when I know I'm not going to need the zoom as the optical quality is so good.A couple of other reviews have commented on the build quality. While the barrel is made of plastic and so doesn't have the solid feel of metal barreled lenses, I cannot find fault with the build. Plus at the price is a cheap lens to replace if you do break it.If you have a Canon D-SLR then this lens should be top of your list to buy. You cannot get a better lens for the money.""
"20051220","5.0","Build quality underrated; a steal at this price","Don't pay much attention to the groupthink opinion that this is a cheap (build) quality lens. Is it tough as nails? Of course not. Do you want to drop kick it around whereever you go? No. But if you take care of your equipment and don't routinely drop anything, will this lens stand up to the test? Certainly.There are two very minor issues with this lens, and both are related. There is no distance scale, and the manual focusing ring isn't very easy to work. It would be nice to, for example, set the manual focus on a particular distance you know ahead of time if shooting in very low light or for sports. For professional shooters, that can be an issue, and if you would depend on either feature for your work, you are probably better off with one of the other 50's in Canon's lineup that may have both (if they do). However, the autofocusing speed on this lens isn't exactly slow, so depending on it isn't a problem. I recently shot indoor basketball pictures and had many fewer out of focus images, as a percentage, than I routinely do with my 70-200 L lens. The latter was used in football, so, to be sure, its an apples to oranges comparison. But my point is that this lens' autofocus can keep up with basketball action with no problem.For indoor available light pics, even sports, this lens can't be beat. For now, its my main basketball lens, though, on my 20D (1.6 factor) I might get something a little wider. It would likely be perfect on the 1.3 factor 1D series of digital cameras. And, of course, its a true 50mm on a film EOS if you shoot that. The background blur is good and the lightweight and compact lens makes shooting easy.I'm not a full time pro, so budget considerations are very important. Will I eventually get the 50 1.4? Probably. If for no other reason, I'd get it for that extra fraction of a stop. But for those of you with Digital Rebels just getting into digital SLR shooting, and wondering why your included lens requires you to use flash indoors or in outdoor stadiums, get this lens and you won't have to worry about flash and the likely red-eye.""
"20051210","5.0","Absolute Best Value in the EOS Line-Up!!!","I simply cannot stress this enough; every EOS owner should buy this lens!!!  50mm is a great focal length for portrait and all-around shooting on a 1.6x cropped DSLR such as the 20d or Rebel XT.  Kit lens users have probably notice that they do most of there shooting on or near the 55mm long end, so this is a very natural substitution.The f/1.8 aperture allows you to take professional looking pictures in low light that rival L-series zoom lenses costing over 10 times more!  The wide aperture also gives the background a nice professional looking soft-focus, but this comes at a price.  When shooting at f/2.8 and especially f/1.8 you need to be VERY careful with focus.  Set the active focus point directly on the subject's eyes to get the clearest picture and if you are taking two people together then make sure they are about the same distance from the lens.  If there is more then about 6 inches difference then one will start to loose facial features due to blur.  Of coerce you can always go down to f/4.0, to get around that issue, but doing so kind of misses the point on this lens.If you normally buy UV filters for your lens you should consider skipping it for this one.  First, you probably don't have any 52mm filters and there isn't much point in buying one to protect a $70 lens.  The front element is about 1/2' from the front the lens, which effectively gives you a built-in hood for some protection.  On top of that, you are probably not taking this lens outside so dust is much less of an issue.Anyway, stop reading and just BUY IT!!!  You will love it!""

Now this lens can only go f/4but if you in the same outdoor setting, had an f/2.8 lens you could jump to 1/500 of a second and get the same exposer. and freeze the action mmore effectivly, this i believe is why it's a 'fast' lens.ok have fun and get it done""
"20051205","5.0","Best Bargain For EOS Cameras","It took Amazon over a month to get this to me, due to it being back-ordered. But now that I have it, it makes me think that it was well worth the wait. Sure you can get lenses that are built stronger (More weight), better optical features (WAY more money), or the ability to zoom (More money and less quality), but you should still go ahead and buy this lens. Even if you don't mind the weight or the extra money or you really don't like the way prime lens make you dance forward and backwards... The bottom line is that this lens takes great photos and is good insurance. You don't have to worry about dust getting into the lens as much as in your zoom lenses, and it can take a great photo is almost any light. All for around $70.Do keep in mind however that on a Rebel XT or 20D, you will effectively have an 80mm, which will make you stand really far back for group shots.""

"20050922","5.0","Incredible value for the money","This is an incredibly sharp lens.  It's a little soft at 1.8, but anything above that is excellent.  Shooting indoor shots without a flash is a joy.  Biggest problems-slow focus and a 5 blade aperture.  The slow focus can be a problem, since the huge aperture and generally short distance to the subject makes for a very small focal plane-inches in some cases.  The five blade aperture means highlights and bokeh have a distinct pentagonal shape.  Still, this is the lens that lives on my camera (Digital Rebel XT).""

"20050915","5.0","A lens that is a must have for budget beginners.....","...and even for the pro-amateurs.I personally just started into the DSLR game with my Rebel XT (body only) and purchased two lenses, the Canon 28-135mm IS USM and the 50mm f/1.8 II.While the 28-135 is decent, that's a completely different story.As for the 50mm f/1.8, it's a terrific lense in all aspects. Where else can you get a VERY inexpensive, sharp, and relatively fast lense that you can shoot in low light conditions. I mean there simply are no other lenses that touch it in it's price point. Being that I had already dumped quite a bit of money to start this hobby. What is another $70 bucks compared to all those other high dollar lenses.While it can be soft wide open, this lense really shines at around f/8.0 rivaling lenses costing 10x the price. And the bokeh (background blur) that it produces is quite nice. It's great for portraits and candids but just make sure that you keep it relatively bright or else you'll find yourself switching to manual focus. While it can't zoom, that is a good thing as primes (single focal length) lenses always yield sharper images and it's a cheap experiment into the world of primes (trust me I've considerd going straight primes after viewing images from this lense compared to my 28-135mm)Overall it's a great lense for the money especially for beginners such as myself. Yes it may not have the greatest body or mount but this a great learning tool and stepping stone into more advanced and expensive (if you even need to go that way) lenses.Give it a try as it is definitely an inexpensive diamond in the rough.""

"20050818","3.0","Perfect Portraits: Canon 50mm f/1.4 vs. f/1.8 Lens Comparison","The 50mm/f1.4 and 50mm/f1.8 are the BEST PORTRAIT LENSES that Canon offers.  I own a Canon Rebel 2000 and Digital Rebel XT and have used both these lenses for several months.  Pictures have been outstanding and my professional customers frequently cite the sharpness, light balance, depth of field, color reproduction, and 'bokeh' (intentional blurring of background in portraits) from these lenses.  Some people question the usefulness of a 50mm lens on digital SLRs with a 1.6x crop factor (i.e., 50mm lens = 80mm on a dSLR like the Digital Rebel XT)... I can vouch that the range is beautiful and relevant, focusing more closely on key subjects in portraits.WHAT DO THESE LENSES HAVE IN COMMON?  They are both fast (the f1.4 is blazing fast - dSLR can hardly keep up!), details are incredibly sharp (you can see individual hair strands), virtually no chromatic (color) aberration, no dithering or shadows in the corners, focusing is rapid and quiet (thanks to Canon's patented Ultrasonic USM technology) and photo quality parallels even my professional Canon 'L' lenses.  These fixed aperture lenses also provide superior pictures than telephoto lenses at 50mm because of better glass and aspherical elements.HOW ARE THESE LENSES DIFFERENT?  Having tested both lenses across 1500+ pictures, there are 5 key factors that make the f1.4 superior (justifying the $300+ price tag).1) FASTER ESPECIALLY IN LOW LIGHT: Extra f-stop makes the f/1.4 better for indoor photos or low light.  Great companion to the 480EX flash.  I was able to take nearly 40 pics/min with flash and the fastest Sandisk 1GB Ultra II CF card2) NO CHROMATIC ABERRATION, whereas the f/1.8 has slight yellowing of photos under certain lighting conditions or where edge definition is low3) FULL AUTO/MANUAL FOCUSING RANGE: f/1.8 requires flipping between auto and manual using a switch, while f/1.4 can be manually 'hot' focused/tweaked after auto focusing4) SUPERIOR BUILD QUALITY:  The f/1.8 is plastic and feels cheap, like it might fall apart anytime.  The f/1.4 is metal, weighty, and is for the proud lens owner5) CLEANER 'BOKEH' - f/1.4 produces beautiful blurring of background in portraits ('bokeh') while the f/1.8 leaves less clean edges.  Canon reviews suggest this is due to the f/1.4 having 8 lens elements vs. 5 elements for the f/1.8WHICH LENS SHOULD YOU BUY?  This is a question of utility vs. value.  The f/1.4 costs over $300 while the f/1.8 can be acquired for under $75.  The f/1.4 will last forever while the f/1.8 will probably break under normal use in a year.  Does this justify the 4x price tag?  If you are a budding photographer looking for a 'play lens' then the f/1.8 will more than over-deliver.  If you are a photo enthusiast who looks for 'the perfect shot,' you will want the f/1.4 because it surpasses every expectation (and so you're not left wondering, 'what if').  If you are a photo professional, you already have the f/1.4 lens among your bag and are not reading this review. :-)""
"20050812","5.0","Best lens for the price","I purchases this lens shortly after buying the Rebel XT.

It has rendered many sharp and colorful pictures!Also, I know that the build quality has been condemned universally, but for some reason I don't think the build-quality is all 'that' bad.Obviously, for the price, anyone who has a EOS 20D or Rebel XT (both of which I own) or a contemporary Canon 35mm film camera should own one of these!I love and recommend this lens!""

I knew that I defintiely wanted a portrait lens, and as I have done a lot of convert photography, it needed to work well in low light situations (like clubs and bars).This lens was probably one of the best investments I have ever made in my photography. Since purchasing it a few months ago I found that I use it far more often than the kit lens, and I am amazed at how much the quality and clarity of my shots has improved. The lens is great for low-light, I had even used it for outdoor night photography (with flash) and gotten great results. Its great for use in low-light daytime situations too,  since this lens allows you to forego the flash. And at $70, it is one of the the cheapest lenses you can buy. This lens has been great- I have used it fairly heavily for a few months now and have no complaints about build quality.

"20050722","4.0","Bang for the buck","Talk about Bang for the buck.  For less than the price for the standard zoom lens that Canon packages with their bodies into kits, you get a lens that has the optical quality of lenses three or four times the cost of this little 50mm f/1.8 II.IMO, this (or the 1.4) should be a required lens in every photographer's kit.  Not only does it allow you to shoot in dim light indoors; but it's tiny, super light, versatile, and practically disposable (well, the 1.8, not the 1.4).On a 20D with a 1.6x FOVCF, this lens becomes something like an 85mm equivalent, making for a pretty good medium portrait lens.People who complain about prime lenses and not being able to frame a shot by a twist of their wrist need to learn how to use their feet.  Sure, zoom lenses offer more versatility and the ability to change the subject to background perspective (angle), but the cost and the quality you get from prime lenses makes a prime lens like this a GREAT VALUE.With the exception of the 100mm f/ 2.8 macro, this is the only other non-L lens in my kit, and I find that I use it a lot -- especially indoors.  This lens on a 20D at ISO1600 and f/2.0 allows me to hand-hold indoors at night with pretty dim light and still get a pretty decent shot.  I use this lens so much I'm thinking of ditching it for the f/1.4 (to get the better glass, the 8-blade aperture, the better construction, the USM, the usable focus ring, etc).With that said, I have to say this lens is pretty good.  It's not GREAT, but it's definitely worth buying, especially since you get so much for your money.  From f/1.8 to about f/2.5 or so, it's kind of soft... especially at f/1.8.  From f/2.5 on though, it's sharp.  Not as sharp as the L-series glass, but much sharper than any of the other consumer grade lenses.  The bokeh is bleh, if you ask me.  Blame it on the 5-blade aperture.  Somebody has a site that compares the bokeh (among other things) on the f/1.8 and the f/1.4, and it's a huge difference.  You can find it pretty easily if you search for it.  Also, when wide-open, the Depth Of Field is REALLY shallow.  You need to anticipate it, because it's hard to tell in the tiny viewfinder.Also, it feels cheap... but who cares, it IS cheap.  The motor is loud, but also who cares?  It's cheap.  Just don't use it when everything is supposed to be quiet.  And the manual focusing ring, unless you're a hobbit, is really hard to use (it's tiny).This lens is a definite 'BUY'.  It's hard to find another lens that's optically such a bang for the buck.  It's cheap.  But clean -- that's the point.""
"20050709","5.0","Great lens for a fantastic price","This little lens is a great find. The price can't get better, and the fast speed makes it ideal when you need to shoot in low light. With a digital camera, the 50mm becomes more like a 75mm, so it is great for portraits, and with the high apeture, gives a nice depth of field effect.Only down side is that it is louder than some of the USM lenses that canon makes. That should not deter anyone, as it really doesn't make much of a difference.Can't go wrong with this lens at this price.""

"20050630","3.0","Fast consumer prime, cheap build quality not USM motor","I needed a fast prime to shoot available light in a gym using my digital rebel in 1600iso mode.  The lens is really quite good, even wide open, but since it's not a USM ring motor, you do have to excercise a little more care when you take it on and off the camera or screw filters onto it.The type of motor in this lens is fragile and sensitive to too much torque being put on the focus ring (puts stress on the motor parts).  Forums advise you to switch to manual focus when putting the lens on or off the camera or installing filters or hoods to avoid moving that front focus ring too much while doing so.The build of this lens is EL CHEAPO plastic.  There is no full time manual focus with this lens.  I find that when shooting vertically that the lens sometimes has a hard time auto focusing (I belive the term is backfocusing), when shooting heavy action it's almost better to leave it in manual mode. I'm sure this was put out there for the photo schools to provide a cheap lens for their students--don't get me wrong it's a good lens for the price but don't expect it to stand up to a lot of heavy use.""
"20050629","5.0","For $70, what more can you ask for?!","This lense is fast f/1.8, sharp, contrasty and built like a cracker jack box toy (OK, build quality is not that bad, as a matter of fact quite acceptable for me).  And it's so light, it virtually adds nothing to the weight of the camera.I sure can't justify over $300 for a 50mm f/1.4 for no discernable image quality improvement compared to this $70 part.  Superb.Man, I wish the canon 70-200mm f/2.8 is in this kind of price range!!  Well the sharpness will shame even the 70-200mm.""

As others have said, it is definitely a GREAT VALUE with excellent (as far as my amateur eyes can tell) image quality.That said, I am returning this lens basically just because it is loud.  For most intents and purposes, it's probably not that big of a deal, but I bought the lens hoping I could take some nice pictures at a friend's indoor wedding, and just think the noise made from focusing will be unacceptable in a quiet church.  $250 *is* a lot of extra dough to drop on the 1.4 just because of the noise, but I'm hopeful some of the other qualities of the lens will make it worthwhile as well.""

"20050410","5.0","Sharp, fast, inexpensive","Once upon a time the 50 mm lens was THE standard camera lens and was THE optical benchmark by which manufacturers were judged and compared.  Although the basic lens focus has now shifted (at least at the low to mid amateur level) to zooms - you can still benefit from years of research and development that went into designing the 50 mm lens and this here lens may be the best lens, dollar for dollar, that you can ever buy.  The question is can you afford not to own this lens?Years of development have brought us a lens that has a fast aperture of 1.8 - far faster than any consumer zoom lens - and that is sharp as a filed tack.  Be forewarned about the sharpness . . . if you are taking pictures of people, this lens is unyielding in its sharpness and may well surprise you and your subjects whose every blemish is captured.  The lens has a fabulously shallow depth of field if you want to use the 1.8 aperture to blow out a background.  This lens is also ridiculously inexpensive.  It is not USM - so it is a little loud.  It does not have a moving focus scale.  For the money though - this is heaven.As to the build quality - yes, it is plastic.  No, it's not built like the Rock of Gibraltar. If you are going to give this lens extensive use as your everyday lens and you shoot a lot, it may not hold up all that well as one reviewer suggests.  However, I've now had this lens and used it fairly regularly (although not as the primary lens) for about 8 years and it is still in great condition.  In my mind, spend the $$ on this first before you go and drop $330 on the 50mm 1.4 USM lens and I think you'll find it gets the job done nicely and that the extra $250 on the 1.4 may not be worth the difference in build (major difference), speed (minor difference) and image quality (minor difference).""

"20030430","3.0","Great images, poor build quality","Optically, you can't really do that much better than the f/1.8 - strong contrast, good color rendition, and very sharp even when shooting wide open.  I bought this lens and it lived on my camera for several months and was the default piece of glass that I reached for when the quality of the shot 'really mattered.'But, honestly, it's built about as solid as a toy prize in a box of Cracker Jack.  After a few months of use - use, not abuse - the lens literally came apart, the front barrel separated from the mount.  The bad news was that the lens was completely shot - it was in pieces, after all - the good news was that it had been cheap, so my pocketbook was able to stand the cost of replacement.I replaced the lens with it's older brother, a used version of the Mark I - much more solid, and which gives equal optical quality even used.  It's a shame that the body and housing on new version of this lens is so shamefully cheap, because the glass is very nice.  But I can't recommend it, unless you either a) don't do that much shooting, or b) don't mind replacing the lens on a fairly regular basis.My suggestion is to either cough up the money for Canon's 50mm f/1.4 - gains you a half a stop and is built to pro-quality standards - or pick up the older version of the f/1.8 on the used market.  Either option will likely end up being cheaper in the long run.""

Aren't all lenses supposed to cost more than the body?I was stoked/shocked to see the sharpness on this lens, the bokeh one could achieve, and the colors that were captured.And which this low price does come a cost - build quality.This lens has been, and for the foreseeable future will be, my daily driver.""

"20120528","4.0","Great lens","This a really nice lens. It works amazingly with sunsets and the sun spots and glares look truly spectacular with it. The only reason I could not give it a five star rating is because there is no zoom for this lens, which means a LOT of walking in and out and still not being able to get as close to the subject as you would like to. I also find that it is extremely hard to focus on the face of your subject. It does not work well with multiple subjects because it doesn't focus well on all of the subjects. However, all in all it is a pretty great lens once you get used to using it. You should definitely have one of these in your camera bag. Very reasonable price.""
"20120527","2.0","Would not autofocus","The lens would not switch from auto to manual focus at all.  The switch was stuck in the autofocus setting like it was superglued there.  I took a couple of test shots and the lens would not focus at all.  Everything was blurry even with one subject at five feet.  Lens was sent to Canon for repair the same day I received it.""
"20120525","5.0","Excellent lens.  Must buy, considering the price","With 1962 reviews before mine, there really isn't a lot to say that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep this very short.The image quality is amazing when stopped down to f2.8 through f8.  By far the best of any of the lenses I currently own.  My wife could even see a lot more detail in my photos and she knows very little about photography and such.  I think her choice of words was just 'wow!' (after showing her a few sample pictures I'd taken).It is a plastic lens, but still feels pretty well made.  If you're used to the kit lens on your camera, this one really isn't any worse (or better).  If you're used to all metal, L glass lenses, then you'll be disappointed.  Take care of it and i imagine this one will last quite a while.If this lens cost any more, then I would have to take a star or two off, but because it is so cheap (inexpensive), I can easily overlook the plastic build quality and say that I highly recommend it.Again, the image quality is just 'Wow!'""

I loved all the photos I took with it. Note: you will need a lot of room when shooting with this lens. I loved it mostly for how little light you could shoot with this. I gave this lens 2 stars because It didn't even last a year before it broke on me. I'm not entirely sure when it even happened. I was in the middle of a newborn shoot when it stopped focusing and manual focus wouldn't even cut it. So if you buy this lens know that it's a great lens but it will only work for a short period of time.""

I specifically bought this lens for my 5DII and am very happy with it because the images are surprisingly sharp.  The lens's body is all plastic and is VERY light indeed.  It feels like a toy but it's a very capable lens.  The motor is on the noisy side compared to the higher end lenses but is acceptable.  I've read the bad reviews and noticed the dates are from a while back (first generation lens?) and most of them complain because it broke apart when the lens was dropped thus giving it a poor rating, go figure.

"20120106","5.0","should be the first lens buy for any dSLR owner","To start this lens is cheap (in relation to the big L lenses) the optics are simply amazing! The lens focus is quick and the 1.8/f is more than any photographer can ask for. All of this has been said in other reviews. What I want to add is the fact that its a prime and how that can help a photographer grow. So you are sick of your kit lens and want something new. Well looking at the big L lenses is the first thing most people do. Heck I own a few and love them! But this lens is always in my bag. 1 its cheap so if you are in a dirty situation you dont mind it getting 'dirt on it' or scratched vs a L lens. Its light, your camera is the so light with this little lens on it. And it makes you think outside of the box. You have to use your feet and work with the 50mm frame you are given.Overall, this lens is a great buy! I would buy another if mine broke. (oh I am using the I version) but I am sure the only difference is the build quality. The optics of both are worth the money.""

While I've only had this lens for a short period of time, it does the job for me! I'm very amateur, but this lens has created great images with a sharp focus, and beautifully blurred background. I'll be sure to post some images soon! Some complain of the noisy motor, doesn't bother me!

If you are currently thinking about it, i would go for it! Although, if you do have a couple more hundred dollars to spend, i would defiantly make the step up to the 50mm 1.4 lens, the 1.8 is great so far.

I love the bokeh, even if it is a bit angular in situations where light sources are pronounced.  Seems to work great in low light conditions, thought the color rendition, in my opinion is a bit warm (which may be good for you depending on taste).I've been shooting with this since christmas just playing with various situations and compositions, and my only real complaint is that on my 1.6 fovc T2i, I've gotta take about 4 more steps back to get everything that I want in the shot.

"20120102","5.0","for the price, you can't go wrong","I bough this lens for a relative who bought my old canon rebel xti from me (at a great price). Since she is pregnant with her 5th kid, I recommended this budget lens as an all-purpose affordable lens that gives a lot of bang for the buck. Personally, i shoot with the 50mm 1.4 which I love, but this does the trick, especially on a 1.6x body like the rebel xti. Anyone learning photography is wise to get a prime lens and learn to frame shots by moving around. Some say zoom lenses make people lazy. By moving around you can actually find better angles and shots than if you could just adjust a zoom. Sure, zooms are great, but prime's are both cheaper and better, and make better photographers, especially for someone just starting out with a dslr on a budget. The main difference to the 1.4 is the build quality is better on the 1.4 and the bokeh is smoother, not to mention a lower f-stop means lower light shooting without cranking up the ISO but not by much. This is perfectly adequate and for $104 on amazon, a no brainer.""

"20120101","5.0","The must-have lens","I'll keep this review short. Soon after I ventured into DSLR photography, i bought this nifty-fifty based on my research for finding a sharp lens that would give me higher quality photos i bought the DSLR for. It was a bit of gamble as i had never used primes and also in order to afford this, i had to sell my kit lens so this would have to be my only lens. I gambled, and so glad i did. I kept this lens for next 2-years - fabulous for kids portraits, amazing low-light performance, and oh that bokeh! This is one lens no one should be without. I became a big believer in available light photography just because what this lens can do. After 2 years i was ready for upgrade - i wanted wider and faster lens (low-light shooting is addictive) thus i decided on Sigma 30mm f1.4. That's another fabulous lens BUT after using that for a while, i noticed i miss not having the ability to take the kind of intimate portraits that this lens used to. Now i am searching for perfect close/tight portrait lens (trying 100mm f2.8, 60mm f2.8, 85mm f1.8) but i know in my heart that if i just go back to this cheap nifty-fifty, i won't have to look further. After spending thousands on quality lenses, i can confess that this lens is absolutely a must have - don't be without it.BTW I also bought the 50mm 1.4 recently but returned it unopened as i read its USM focus motor is troublesome and always breaks down. I opted for 60mm 2.8 over it. You can read how that went in my 60mm f2.8 review.""

I got a Canon T2i package for Christmas. The kit came with 18-55mm and 50-250mm zoom lenses. I also got a $50.00 Amazon.com gift certificate, which was burning a huge hole in my pocket as soon as I received it. So I googled 'what accessory to buy for T2i'. This lens came up frequently in the search results as a great all around lens, primarily because of its low f-stop setting, which allows a very shallow depth of field. If you don't know what this means, google it (like I did) and you will quickly understand why you're trading in your point and shoot for a new hobby. After a few days of study online (youtube has some great basic photography tutorials), I received this lens and began shooting people, flowers, pets, pens, TV remotes, oranges, noses, ears, eyes. This lens creates some very compelling photos. If you're new to DSLR and wondering whether or not to buy this lens, do it. You won't regret it.""

I've missed a few shots because of it.I was taking some photos with my 550D and suddenly saw an opportunity to take video.  I flipped the camera to video and grabbed on to the focus and cranked it.  Well, I had failed to turn off the autofocus on the lens and it made a cranky noise.  Now, the focus ring doesn't feel smooth when rotating it - it grinds a bit like there is a grain of sand or two in it.  However, it still auto-focuses perfectly.Moral of the story: I've beaten this lens up and it still works great.I recommend this lens to all of my friends and family when they get their first DSLRs.  Absolutely unbeatable for the price.""

It does feel a little cheap because it is plastic but the picture quality is incredible. The auto focus is pretty quick but it doesn't really matter to me because I enjoy manual focus much more. This lens gives a great bokeh and is awesome in low light. Here is a real scenario of how good it works: When I would take a picture inside my house using the 18-55mm kit lens without a flash I had a 1/60(sometimes even slower) shutter speed, ISO set at 3200 and the aperture at 5.6 just to be able to get a picture where everything isn't blurry. With this new lens and the same lighting conditions I was able to use no flash and have 1/60 shutter speed, ISO at 200 or 400, and the aperture set at 1.8 and it looks awesome. I definitely recommend this lens to someone who is looking to get a great looking picture for a low cost.""

I personally love a blurred background when taking pictures of people and close up objects, and this lens allows you to do that.It is worth noting that this lens is not without its faults. It is slow to react sometimes, and it gets locked on itself in a weird position and won't let me take any pictures. I have to zoom out, refocus and then go back in for the shot. Also, it's not a macro lens, you will not be able to shoot a small flower with this lens.Overall, this is a great lens for an amazing price.

"20111226","5.0","Perfect for a new DSLR user!","I just purchased a Canon T2i before the holidays, taking advantage of a good deal. I received this lens as a gift after adding it to my amazon wish list. Since I've gotten it, my kit lens hasn't gone back on my camera.I have read that one negative about this lens is the plastic lens mount. Both of the EF-S lenses (the kit 18-55mm and my 55-250mm) that I currently own also have plastic lens mounts. This may not be as common among more expencive lenses, but as someone who can't afford to throw the money into lenses, a plastic mount is a good compromise.It is very small, almost surprisingly so. That makes it light and very easy to carry. It takes VERY sharp pictures! I could even see dust on surfaces in the photos that I couldn't see with my eyes. You loose some of that detail when you have the lens wide open at F/1.8, but that's to be expected.I find this lens to be perfect for taking pictures of people when wide open. I plan on using this lens for family and school photos. Having to 'zoom by foot' isn't a disadvantage in this case, I have all the time I need to compose my picture. Wide open you can eliminate background, and I find the moderate loss of sharpness to be a great effect.This lens is great. I can't speak for experienced photographers, but this lens is a MUST for anyone with a new DSLR. The flexibility it offers to someone just starting up is really an eye-opener as to what you can do with the right equipment for the job - and is a great tool for experimentation. And at this price, if you can't afford it after paying for your camera, its still in the price range that many consider for gifts. I can't wait to try this lens with a macro extension tube!""

"20111225","5.0","Plastic Jewel","I bought a T3i not too long ago, which came with a 18-135mm lens.  This lens is quite heavy.  Now there might be situations when you do not actually need the zoom capability and you rather looking a light lens that does add too much 'bulk' to you camera body.  The 50mm lens from Canon is the lightest lens Canon offers for their SLRs.  The relative aperture of 1.8 is far lower than the one of my standard lens that starts somewhere in the 3-something range and goes up depending on the zoom applied.  So, 1.8 will give you far more flexibility when it comes to low light conditions.  I read tests where the 50mm f/1.8 scored even better than the 1.2 version, which costs about a 1,000 dollars more.  The tests also show that the aperture set to 4 brings the best results.  In summary:  This lens is amazing.  It is light and you get crystal clear shots.  Just be aware that there is no zoom whatsoever.  50mm is 'all' what you get.""
"20111225","5.0","Great lens for the money","This is just the best lens I have owned for the money.  With the large aperture, you can shoot easily indoors, but you consequently get a very shallow depth of field.  This lens is what the art of photography is about.  You can control and create a shot where as many of the kit lenses that are available have a maximum aperture of 4 and the difference between 2.8 and 4 is substantial, and the difference between 4 and 1.8 is GINORMOUS.The lens does get a little soft when it is wide open, but in low light, you really aren't going to be able to take any kind of shot without using either a hotshoe flash or a lens that will cost 3 to 10 times as much as this one.Outside of a tripod, this lens along with its cousins is absolutely the way to go.""
"20111223","4.0","Like this lens","This lens is a perfect addition for any casual/advanced photographer.  The photos are clear throughout the the aperture range and the low light capability is outstanding.  What I didn't like is the lack of USM autofocus and the plastic construction of the lens but definitely not a showstopper for the price of the lens.  If you want USM and better construction as well as more light gathering, go with the 50mm 1.4 USM. For me, this is the best hundred dollars you can spend on a lens. I'm very satisfied.""

As previous raters have stated, this is made almost entirely out of plastic - eh...  I am sure that once I exchange this lens (I can't deal with the dirt), I will be totally happy with my purchase.BTW:  If it was not stated in the product details - the diameter is 52 (reference purchasing filters).""
"20111221","5.0","Great lens for the price","I use this lens a lot and there's no doubt that it offers the best bang for the buck of any lens I've ever used. The casing of this lens is made from plastic, which makes it a little bit fragile, but the optics are glass and the photos this lens captures are very sharp with vivid colors. If bokeh (the out of focus part of the photo) is important to - for example if you take still life or food photos - this may not be the best lens for you as the 5 blade diaphragm doesn't create really smooth bokeh. But as a general purpose lens this is an great buy.""

"20111220","5.0","Nifty Fifty, indeed","I should begin by saying that I rate products on the basis of their value proposition - do you get what you pay for when purchasing this item?In the case of this lens, the answer is 'duh. absolutely.'The 'nifty fifty' or 'plastic fantastic,' as it is often called, is not going to win any awards in the 'most intimidating L-series glass' category. It is a very ho-hum lens with rather boring looks and cheap construction. That being said, if you shoot Canon and do not have one of these in your bad, one of two things is probably true:A: You carry the 50 1.4 or 50 1.2B: You are crazy.This lens is a fantastic introduction to the various joys of shooting with prime lenses. It does not zoom. It does not have vibration control. It lacks any bells and whistles in many other lenses, all of which are vastly more expensive. What it does have is outstanding sharpness and an incredibly wide open aperture FOR THE PRICE. The quality of the images produced by this lens when compared to the various kit lenses available with Canon DSLRs is outstanding.When connected to a crop sensor (1.6x, i.e., everything but 1D and 5DII) camera, this lens shoots as though it were 80mm on a full frame, placing it directly in the portrait photography sweet spot. Having shot with the 85 1.2L, I can say that while the 50 1.8 is not the last word in sharpness or picture quality, it provides nearly 90% of the performance at 5% of the price - a starling value proposition.What do you lose for that 1900 or so dollars, i.e., what are the shortcomings of this lens?1. Bokeh-quality: this lens has a 5 blade aperture, rendering out of focus highlights into pentagonal shapes, rather than smooth circles. An upgrade to the 50 1.4 will only get you hexagonal OOF highlights - if you want the incredibly smooth circles, you need to step up all the way to the 50 1.2. That having been said, the large aperture of his lens can still liquify nearly any background with the use of minimall conscientious framing and focus.2. Build quality: it's the 'plastic fantastic' for a reason. With the exception of the lens elements, this lens is constructed entirely of plastic. The mount, in particular, could provide cause for concern. Luckily, it's incredibly small and light, suggesting that there will be little stress on the mount. It isn't a super-telephoto. And if you break it, you can buy another.3. Absolutely top-end speed. A 1.2 lens is (give or take) a full-stop faster than a 1.8. Why should you care about this? I'll explain a bit more below...Why do you want this lens?1. It's FAST. Let's return to the stops mentioned above. At it's fastest, the EF-S 18-55 IS II kit lens has an aperture of 3.5. At a similar focal length (50mm) it is likely shooting at 5.6. That is three-and-a-quarter stops slower than the 1.8 is capable of shooting. This means that the 50 1.8 can use a shutter speed that is 8 times faster than the kit lens. Real world testing (conducted unscientifically as I sit here) confirms this - the same shot on the 18-55 is 8 times slower (1/8) a shot  on a 50 1.8 II (1/60). Why care? Camera shake matters, but image stabilization corrects much of this. It is worth remembering, though, that the best IS performance is only going to make up for 3-4 stops worth of shake, when they are working at their best. More importantly, no IS system is capable of making your subject hold perfectly still. If you want to nail that perfectly sharp portrait, you need speed!2. Depth of Field/Bokeh: A kit lens outside of wide angles is simply going to focus on a much deeper field than a wide-open prime. Why does that matter? True depth of field for this lens, mounted on a 1.6 crop body and focused on an object 10 feet away, is about eight inches, just enough for a face and most of a human head. Everything else will be pleasantly and softly out of focus, creating a high degree of emphasis on the subject of your photo. At 5.6, the same lens is going to create a depth of field of roughly 24 or 25 inches, letting a good deal more into the 'sweet spot' of your photo. There are certainly photos where this is a good thing. But the amount of creativity that wide apertures allow a photographer is nearly endless.3. Sharpness. The fact of the matter is that prime lenses are sharper than zooms, or at least any zoom that wouldn't qualify as a ridiculous comparison to this lens. When you nail your focus and framing, the results are simply magical.4. Learning curves. This lens lacks IS. It is quite fast, meaning that it has a very shallow depth of field. You'll miss some shots as a result. You will also begin to learn some of the more fundamental and important skills that a photographer needs to produce beautiful images.That, more than anything, is why I think this is such a high-value proposition. For barely more than $100, you will be buying your first ticket into the world and art of honest-to-goodness photography, contrasted with the activity of taking pictures. Once you've had a taste, you'll probably be hooked, but the products are entirely worthwhile.""
"20111219","5.0","Perfect for most occassions","I purchased this lens after reading various photography books and blogs. I have now used it for about a month and I am very impressed with the results. The potraits or indoor snaps that I took with this lens are amazing. Many of my friends who own SLR camera are leaning toward owning this lens once they saw the photos I took with this lens.Due to larger aperture(f1.8), the lens can create short depth of field and the effect of it is amazing. It easily defocuses the foreground and background of the subject which cannot be achieved with any other zoom lens (18-55; 18-135 etc). Recently I took some photos with Xmas light in the backgound, it created a beautiful effect of lights in the background by blurring the xmas lights.You can also use it on outdoor(daytime) setting by reducing aperture to greater than f3.5. I have this lens on my camera most time - I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in taking potrait or family snaps.""
"20111219","5.0","AWESOME!","First off. Let me say to others. STOP DROPPING THE DAMN LENS! I have 5 lenses. In 7 years I have never dropped a single one! What do you people do? Any lens will break or losen up something if you drop it! Anyway. Get this lens over the 1.4. Why? Because on the 1.4 YOU CAN NOT USE IT AT 1.4! All your images will have a glow around. That is common for that lens. So you have to use it at 1.8 and 2.0. So why would you buy a 1.4 you can not use. Get the 1.8. It is a wonderful sharp lens! And you save about $200.00Yes the 1.8 has cheap build quality compared to things that are NOT metal! Just dont drop the thing! It has lasted me two years so far!""
"20111219","5.0","Must have as your first lens","This is a must have for your first lens.  At slightly over $100, this is cheap for a prime lens that will allow you to be creative with your shots.  On a crop sensor camera, the effective focal length is about 80mm which is a short-tele prime.  Though the auto-focus is a little noisy, but the lens is only $100.""
"20111218","5.0","My best investment in photography so far.","I read a lot of good reviews about this lens and finally bought it. Now, most of the time I have this lens attached to my camera body. I think, My best investment in photography so far. I made one of my friend buying this lens.""
"20111218","4.0","nice lens","great lens! using it on my canon t2i and love it. excellent value for the price. wish canon had more value lenses like this for amateur photogs like me who don't really need the high end, high priced lenses.""
"20111218","4.0","Bad copy?","The fact that this lens was only $100, coupled with the fact that it generally receives high marks from reviewers here and on other websites, keeps me from giving it 2 stars.  Perhaps I got a poor copy of the lens, because at 1.8 the lens is simply not sharp.  Yes, I know how to take photos, I made sure shutter speed was high enough to be a non-issue.  I did many comparisons of shots with the lens at apertures 1.8-5.6.  At 5.6, this lens IS quite sharp, and even by f4, it is performing well.  But what's the point really of having 1.8 if it's basically unusable?  I'm sure others will disagree (and have, for that matter), and perhaps I'll get a ton of responses blasting me for my poor review, but as I said perhaps my copy was simply poor.  Regardless, it's going back.  It's too bad, as I was hoping for a cheap, good lens.  The hunt continues.(Update)So after trying a few other lenses, and deciding I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a lens until I get my taxes back, and until I rent a few and decide what I want, I made the decision to order another copy of this lens.  It has turned out to be the right move, and has invariably justified my thinking that the first one I got was a bad copy.  This new lens focuses quick, usually accurately, and is very sharp, without any front/back focusing issues.  Yes, it's still soft at 1.8, but NOTHING compared to the previous copy, and is pretty darn tack sharp by f4.  Even at 2.8 it's looking really good, and photos at 1.8 are completely usable.  So I originally had given the lens 3 stars, but I have upped it to 4.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 is that it's very cheaply made (which of course makes the price easy to swallow, however, I would pay $50 more for a more solidly constructed lens).  All in all, a very good lens for the money.""
"20111217","4.0","Worth It While It Lasts","I do not regret buying this lens.  I got a good year and a half out of it.  I produced beautiful images and received many compliments, everyone always wanting to know what lens I used.With the 1.8, you get great versatility.  The only time I had legitimate problems was in really, really bright sunlight.I'm going to be quite honest.  While the quality of this lens's pictures does degrade significantly after the first few months you have it, with good upkeep, you can keep it awhile.  Mine never really 'broke' - I never had the front half fall off like what happens to most people with this lens - numerous bumps and falls and sand from the beach eventually took their toll.""
"20111217","5.0","You get what you pay for, plus so much more!","The Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 is the best lens in its price range. Usually when you buy a lower end lens you sacrifice build quality and optics for the function of the lens. Example. The Canon 75-300 f/4 II will get you the zoom you need but fails to deliver sharp images when zoomed in, because of lower quality optics. With the Canon 50mm f/1.8 you do sacrifice build quality, however, it's optical performance and ability to have a depth of field as shallow as f/1.8 makes up for its plastic, toy like construction. As well, who can argue its quality when it's only a $100? I have had this lens for a couple years now and have been completely satisfied with the pictures it can take since day one. For its price, in my opinion, you can't go wrong with this lens regardless what type of photographer you are.""

"20111217","5.0","I love this lens!","I've had my Canon EOS rebel XSi for one year now and I upgraded from the kit lens to a Sigma 18-200mm. I decided I wanted to get a fixed focus lens when I played around with my brother's f1.4 50mm lens. After a lot of research I was set on the 50mm f1.8 because it was within my budget and I read great reviews about it. For the price that it is, it takes great pictures. The bokeh is very nice and the images are very sharp. The auto focus is sort of loud, but I don't mind because I prefer manual focus. It is completely made of plastic, almost like a toy, so I suggest just being extra careful with it and you'll be all set! For starting photographers with a budget, this is a perfect lens for you!""

"20111216","5.0","Wonderful Lens","This lens is great, period.  People say 'for the money,' but I'm saying regardless of cost this lens is great!  Mine is so very sharp focusing on my Canon 20D digital camera.  I love the contrast and the color.  It is truly my favorite lens.  I have two high priced Canon L zoom lenses, and this 50mm II 1.8 is still my favorite.  I tried the Canon 24-70 L and I liked this one better. People say they love the contrast of the 24-70 L lens but for me it was too much(the image was just too dark looking). Yeah, I know kind of crazy, maybe, but that just gives you an idea that this 50mm is nice.  Plus if you, heaven forbid, scratch this one or damage it,  you can buy 3 of these for the price of the Canon 50mm 1.4.  (Note: Maybe the 24-70 L lens I had was a bad copy, because I have seen some beautiful photos on the web that were taken with it)Now, the only downside of this lens, if you can even call it that, is that I can't always use it for inside shots because 50mm is a little long and won't give me the wide shot I might need to include more people at parties and such.  On my digital camera, the 50mm is the equivalent of an 80mm on an old fashioned or very expensive full sensor digital camera, which is the focal length many people use for portraits.  I remember my first Christmas with this lens and it produced some great portrait shots of individuals opening presents and such.Oh, I almost forgot, shooting in low light without a flash is a blast!  No more red eye, reflections off glasses or harsh flash lighting.  However, if shooting indoors you really need to get the white balance set for the type of lights inside, or adjust it after the fact via your photo processing software of choice.  Some cameras do better than others with the auto white balancing.I've had mine for several years and still love it.  Honestly, I don't know how you could go wrong with this lens.""

"20111214","5.0","Fantastic optics, so-so build quality","I bought this lens even though the focal length overlapped my 17 -50 mm Tamron (another excellent lens), because of the size and weight. Suddenly my Rebel XTI is almost like a range-finder camera and is so much more usable. The lens produces excellent images, both with daylight and in low light.

"20111213","5.0","nice, low price lens","I was worried about not having a zoom on this lens, but it has not been as big of a problem as I thought it would be. For general use with my family, I can easily take a step back or forward to frame my photo. This lens really allows me to take faster pictures in dim lighting, which really helps me take more candid photos. There are times when the lens has a hard time focusing, but it doesn't bother me to manually focus. Since it is such a small lens there isn't much of a hassle to flip the auto/manual focus switch. I like that the lens is small and lightweight, especially since I don't like carrying large heavy camera bags and I have small hands. If you want a nice low light lens at a low price, I would recommend this lens.""
"20111213","5.0","Incredible value for the money","Saw all the great reviews about this lens on amazon. Ended up buying it from Adorama last weekend. Got it and took some low light still life pictures with it and the performance for dollar is just crazy on this model.Plus - Incredible low light performance, sharpness of the object in focus, bokeh effect so sought after in potrait shots and a super fast aperture rating of 1.8. In f/1.8 the sharpness is so accurate that it is possible to blur other areas on the object. This is the kind of performance that rivals 500$ lenses. For the price difference between this lens and the 1.4 picked this one without any second thought.Minus - Feels like a cheap lens....with all this incredible performance canon needs to have saved money elsewhere and that is the body. for the price you will not get any IS features. I am glad they have a af/mf button on the body. In AF the focusing is loud and it almost sounds like sand paper rubbing together. I try to use it mostly in manual focus...the ring is pretty flimsy and you might feel that you are breaking it.but beyond the small minuses..this lens is an absolute steal for the price....on my Canon T2i the images that I get are beyond beautiful... definitely looking forward to do some landscape shooting with this one.Also posted some sample images taken with this lens.....just looking at the images people have taken with this lens made me buy it :)..so passing on the bug!""

The pictures I have taken with this thing for the past couple of weeks have been outstanding and incredibly sharp! I have never used an L lens, so my expectations are probably a little low (hence, the excitement I have over this lens). I did take the plunge and order the Canon 17-55 f/2.8 (Merry Christmas to me!) last week though, so I can get rid of the kit lens. Anywway, I'm just getting started with photography (personal, not business), and I would highly recommend this to anyone else who is also. It's a great prime and a great value!

For $100, dirt cheap by lens standards, this is an incredible value.

This also equates to a very useful 80mm on a 1.6 crop body, which is likely what you are using if on you are getting a $100 lens in the first place, since you aren't a pro, or someone who starts up a cozy fire on a chilly morning with all your extra cash.Once you start using this, I can pretty much guarantee you will fall in love with it; and you will likely wind up using this far more often then your zoom lens(es).

"20111204","4.0","Still looking for that sweet spot...","I want to love this lens. I really do.  In fact, owning this gem was actually a motivator that made me buy my digital SLR!  Seriously, I'm a big bang for the buck guy, and a father of 2 GORGEOUS little girls (the other biggest motivator for buying a 60D), and the idea of having a very fast lens that would allow me to shoot in natural light/low light situations (not a big flash guy), and that was considered the perfect 'portrait' length lens, for only $100?  Sounds too good to be true.  Well, maybe, maybe not.  I remember from my days as a Rebel XS owner with the God-awful kit lens that whenever I was taking pictures of my kids, I had a muscle memory that was almost reflexive: zoom almost all the way in and crank the wheel to the left (to get the lowest aperture possible).  Why?  I had settled on 'zoomed almost all the way in' as the most pleasing focal length for portraits. On that lens, that was--you guessed it-- about 50 mm.  And cranking the aperture all the way down?  Well, of course that was to get a short depth of field.  Unfortunately, though, that lens was so slow that, zoomed in that far, it wasn't quite short enough to get any of the pleasing blurred backgrounds we all love so much, and which scream, 'Hey! This picture was taken with a REAL camera!'.Enter the 'nifty 50'.  It stands to reason that as a prime lens, perfectly suited to this style of picture, and with a much lower aperture, it would be my go-to, but it's not that cut and dry.  The reason being, the trade-offs often make it a less desireable choice than my other lens, the 18-135 mm f3.5-5.6 IS (60D kit lens). Read on...Does the 50 mm f1.8 lens make blurry backgrounds a snap?  Sure it does.  But my dreams of shooting without a flash in low light and getting gorgeous, sharp portraits with blurred backgrounds are taking a bit of a beating.  See, according the reviews and my real-world testing, this lens is a bit of a mess at f1.8.  lt has noticeable edge blur and suffers from a lot fringing and some other  general sharpness-busting badness you don't want in a portrait.  How do you fix it?  You stop down.  According the the thorough review at dpreview [...] you get your sharpness back at around f3.5, and it performs its best at f5.  f5!?  Yes.  So, what do you get inside with artificial light at f5?  Motion blur.  You generally need to shoot at a really high ISO, which can be noisy, or at a low shutter speed, which introduces motion blur.  Not holding camera steady enough or not on a tripod?  According to the old 1/focal length rule of thumb, you're just not going to get good results below 1/50th of a second.  And this is where my other lens comes back.  See, at 50mm, the zoom lens, which is also surprisingly sharp, matches the 50mm's aperture at f5.  And--and this is a biggie--it has image stabilization.  Once I realized all this, I ran a few tests to see if it really meant what it sounds like.  I WANTED to be proven wrong on this.  Like I said, I really want to love the 50.  But test after test, I found that at 50mm, f5, with image stabilization on, I get better results from the zoom lens just about 100% of the time.  I'm sure there are situations where having the ability to jump down to f3.5 or f1.8 will be a welcome capability, but so far, I am finding that I am more likely to get a shot I will keep--a sharp, well-exposed shot without motion blur or noise--when I use my zoom lens.I don't mean this review to be an authoritative dismissal of this lens. On the contrary, I still gave it 4 stars, because I still think it's a surprisingly good product for the price, and have no doubt I will get some good results from it.  It just so happens that I bought it for a pretty specific reason, and I'm finding out that it may not be so well-suited for that purpose.  I'm still looking for That perfect use for the lens that makes me sure I couldn't do without it.""
"20111203","4.0","Great buy for the Money.","i like the DOF when the subject is away from the background a little. it makes the subject stand out more and the background merely that.. a background. The issue however is even in auto focus if you are taking pictures of foliage you get your focus set on where you want it and a gust of wind comes just as you snap and you look and it looks like it just raced by.. not really the lens' fault but still.. it's not fast enough for those types of things.i picked up a 1.4 lens as well and awaiting the lens to do a comparison on if this one will suffice or is it worth the extra couple hundred to go for the other one.""
"20111203","5.0","Lots of bang for your buck.","I love this lens... there's such an incredibly amazing difference to this than my kit lens and it's such professional quality for such a cheap price! The only down side is it is a fixed lens, of course, and doesn't zoom in or out. It is also at portrait range so you have to stand back really far to get things in the frame.Overall - BUY IT! You won't regret it!""
"20111201","5.0","Good enough. On a cropped sensor camera it is equivalent to about 80mm.","I bought this as my second lens. It is actually as good as it sounds, and despite it has a plastic build, it is good enough for me. The only thing I didn't consider, and it was my mistake, is that on a cropped sensor camera like mine, 50mm is actually equivalent to about 80mm. I am not returning it though.""

"20111126","5.0","best value lens EVER","I fell in love with the lens the moment I started using it. sure, the build quality is cheap. it's all plastic and the focusing sounds like a blender, but the quality of the pictures is amazing for a 120 dollar lens. saturation of colors is excellent, no noticeable chromatic aberration, great sharpness. I prefer this to the t2i stock lens since the colors are more saturated and picture is sharper, not to mention the 1.8f aperture. Some people say they don't use the 18-55mm since they found this lens. I have to disagree. The 18-55 is too versatile to be substituted with this prime 50mm. but this lens definetely takes better pictures than the 18-55 at 50mm.I have a t2i and 3 lens: the 18-55, the 55-250 and this one. I'm not a pro, just a hobbyist and this lens is great for me.""
"20111126","4.0","Slamming lens","I purchased this lens under the suggestion of my boss, and I honestly love it to death. My only beef with it is the fixed zoom, as it produces a very narrow field of viewing and has resulted in a (go figure) very expensive step up. This lens slays in low light, and I've gotten a few great shots at the show I went to earlier in November. Might post one up to show what this sucker can do.Pros: Very fast, quick to focus, does well in low light.Cons: Narrow field of view, zoomed in too far for being a front row fiend at a show.""

A friend lent me his 50-mm Canon f/1.4 USM lens, which is absolutely fantastic, but I just couldn't work it into the budget. I feel a little funny mounting this lens on my 7D, sort of a tail-wags-dog feeling, but this game is all about the results--and the photos are just great. Chromatic aberration is a bit of a problem when shooting wide open, but all-around, you won't find a better value in a fast lens for the Canon DSLR family. For image quality, I'd give this lens four stars if all other things were equal--but at this price point there's no debate in my mind about the five-star rating.""
"20111124","5.0","Best Value For Money","This lens is definitely not 'the best' lens around. But 6 iris blades, 1.8 f/stop, and auto focus for 100 bucks? This lens will prove value to any photographer who uses it! Its low light capabilities are nothing short of brilliant. Its all plastic and construction is not the greatest but is pretty solid as long as you dont beat it up or drop it.In comparison with the other canon lenses like 50mm 1.4 and 1.2, this lens is better for its dollar to performance value. If you are a obsessive pro who must have the best of the best equipment then maybe look into the 1.4 or 1.2 50mm L lenses. If you are a pro or hobby photographer who wants the best image for the dollar and dont want to go broke, then this is your lens.I have been shooting with this lens a while and i NEVER put my canon 28-135 back on after starting to use this lens.CoreyFaymus Mediafaymusmedia.comfacebook.com/faymusmedia888-864-1370""
"20111123","2.0","Not too good.","I returned this lens and got the Sigma 50mm.  There's a reason the Sigma is more expensive, it takes better photos.  Don't waste your precious photographic moments with this Canon lens. You can have better bokeh, more clarity and less distortion with the Sigma.  Also, if you have other 77mm filter sized lenses, the you can share your polarizer, ND and UV filters with the Sigma 50mm f1.8 instead of buying a whole new set for this little Canon lens.  A good polarizer, UV and a couple NDs will end up costing you the price difference.""
"20111123","5.0","Perfect for a beginner who wants great photos","This lens is fantastic for someone who has just started out with their DSLR and wants to experiment with bokeh and lower f-stops than what a kit lens will provide.  I received this as a Christmas gift last year and have come so far in my photography since then.  This little guy will produce amazing pictures if you take a little time to learn about manual settings.  It's not at the professional level in low light but for the price it really is great.  I'm currently waiting for my 50mm 1.4 to arrive in the mail and have already sold this lens for close to what I paid for it because most people know the thrifty 50 is awesome.

"20111115","5.0","Good lens for the price","For less then $150 you can't find a better deal for a lense.  Being able to shoot without a flash is great in alot of situations and i was stunned at the sharp picture quality even when down at f1.8.  I'd be looking at a room that looked sort of dark and the picture would come up and the room looked brighter then i thought the shot would come out like.One thing to note is that on my XSi body and the 1.6 crop factor it turns this from a 50mm to more like a 80mm.  So taking shots of things close up requires you to step back a little bit which can sometimes be annoying.  As a result i'm planning on also getting the 28mm f1.8 which will give me a little more wide angle.""
"20120521","5.0","Love This Lens","For indoor portrait type photos, this thing is awesome, especially for the price.  Great specs on it.  Looks great, too.""
"20120519","5.0","Simply stunning","Received it a couple of days ago and just started shooting to get a feel for the lens with a Canon 20d body.  Simply wonderful.  It is light and yes it weighs practically nothing, but what a marvelous lens.  The pics are amazing.  Playing around with it to determine its limitations and sweet spot.  At 1.8, the pics inside the house was very good even at ISO settings between 400-1600 (80% taken without flash).  Yes it was soft, but very little noise.When I tested outside to take pics of flower and plants, some shots were just 'simply stunning' and provide a great 3D effect (F7 or F8) with exceptional IQ.  Since I got the 20d (body, batteries & case) for $160 and the lens for less than $130 (UV filter and hood), I didn't expect to get the excellent results.  It has been a long while since my 35mm film camera experience and remembering some of the techniques for those film days really helped with the DSLR. I started with the camera again since I was so frustrated with the P&S camera's inability to get moving pics of my grand-daughter. Now all of that has changed with the 20d & 1.8 lens. Some pics:[...]Did you note the bugs that were captured in the shoot?Please note that these are reduced JPEG files and looks somewhat soft because it is at less than 700k where the originals are at 3-8 MB (RAW & JPEG formats). I'm now looking for a Canon 15-85 or Sigma 17-70 to try out and have a good all around general, non-prime lens.""
"20120519","5.0","a Great lense to own!","Anybody who has a Canon camera and wants to do professional like photoshoots must own this lens. It does exactly what the expensive lens does. A must have!""
"20120518","4.0","We all know its cheap, but does it deliver????","So aside from hundreds of people complaining that its cheaply made, or loud focusing - we know that already, we know it costs ~115 bucks and thats probably what is driving us to even look at this lens! But the real question is, is it a big upgrade over the kit lens? and does it deliver relative to the more expensive lenses?In short, my answer is yes. BUT....First there are serious drawbacks. First - is its focus is a bit slower than I expected, i knew it was slow but i would say its slightly slower than the kit lens. Second, and more important - its not versatile. 50mm on a cropped sensor body is just too narrow. Indoors its hard to find enough space to step back to fit the whole picture. This lack of versatility really prevents this lens from staying on your camera always, and also creates the need for either other wider primes or a zoom lens (just because you realize that the kit lens is crap :]). Be prepared to spend because now you will need a better zoom lens! Third - the 1.8 depth of field is so narrow that if you focus on someones eyes, the tip of their nose is not in focus, nor are their ears. So this 1.8 setting really can be used for those 'artsy' photos. If you have a group of people to take a picture of, you will need to stop the lens down a bit anyway to at least 2.8+. And finally, at 1.8 its not super sharp. Its sharp, but nothing compared to what it is at 5+, at which point you need alot of light anyway!On the bright side - this lens is very sharp especially compared to the kit lens, colors are good (not great), and its light. I would say the bokeh is really cool but the more experienced eye would notice that it is a bit harsh.In conclusion - you cannot get this kind of performance for this price anywhere else, just be prepared to get another wider lens for versatility purposes :)""

"20120514","4.0","Great lens for the $, just make sure you know what you're getting","This lens is a little gem.  I always have it in my bag for those times when I'm stuck without decent lighting or I really just want to drop the background out.  Heck, some days this goes on the camera and I leave my other elnses at home for pure simplicity.  For the money, it can't be beat...its pretty sharp wide open and will gather many times more light than anything zooms costing even 10x more.  My only gripe is that manual focusing is a PITA with this since it has no real focus ring...just the little knurled portion hanging on the front of the lens, and it feels pretty loose as well.  It is pretty accurate as far as autofocus goes, but its not quite as fast or accurate as the 50mm 1.4 and 'breathes' a bit when trying to find a subject sometimes.  If you are doing portrait work or static work, stop it down to F5.6 or F8 and you see really wouldnt think this is a ~$100 lens.  If you're willing to deal with the focus ring(or lack of I should say), its something you wont regret having in your bag!""

"20111109","4.0","You will be amazed at your photos","I was amazed at the photos I saw coming out of my camera. as my first lens faster than f/3.5, I can say that this is one of the best purchases to help propel my photography to the next level. on crop factor cameras the focal length is a little tight at about 80mm but the way I look at it is that it makes me more creative with my placement and positioning to get the shot I want. You will find yourself stepping back a lot further than normal when you're doing casual candid photography in smaller areas sometimes not being able to get the shot you want because of the focal length plus crop factor.As for the construction, it's ok. not as 'toy-like' as I was expecting from all the reviews. the way I see it is the less it weighs, the less I have to carry around. so it can feel light and flimsy all it wants as long as it keeps producing photos like i've been getting. If it's not 'rugged' enough for you, then maybe you need to step back and take a look at how you treat your beloved camera equipment. I don't really do anything special but my equipment all looks and functions like brand new and I've logged tens of thousands of hours with my gear.as others noted I too have noticed that the focus does feel a touch soft wide open. still not ENTIRELY sure if it's soft focus or an unsteady hand and too slow of a shutter speed. I haven't done the tripod test yet but I think sometimes people are often too quick to blame their equipment when a review of the EXIF might reveal that the settings weren't what they should have been. Maybe i'm that guy but I think my kit lens might be crisper wide open at slower shutter speeds.

Somehow, it seems to make any portrait beautiful. It's actually difficult to figure out how to make an ugly portrait with this lens. It's light, the colors are perfect, f/1.8 is very useful, it's sharp and high contrast, and the bokeh is amazing (not at all smooth, but still beautiful).I was surprised at how the lens felt. It feels great on my t1i. It's solid, it's easy to find the auto to manual focus switch, and I forget that it's made entirely out of plastic. The only things I didn't like about this lens are that the focus ring is tiny, making manual focus more difficult, and the focus isn't smooth. When you turn it it just feels like dry plastic grinding against dry plastic.To sum it up...pros: Great color, contrast, and sharpness. It feels solid and light. The autofocus is surprisingly fast. F/1.8 is great for a $100 lens.cons:Tiny focus ring, manual focusing isn't smooth.There are definitely lenses similar to this one that are better in every category, but I couldn't believe the photo quality that I got for $100.""

I use a Canon T2i that I've got almost 2 years of experience on.  I've used this lens to take about 500 pictures and I have to say that I love it.  For the money ($104.00) I couldn't imagine finding a better deal out there.  This lens lets me take super-crisp pics with good depth and allow me to get the pics I want.  Yes, it's a drag to not be able to zoom in, but that's not why you buy this lens.  Anyway,  having used my buddy's f/1.4 Canon lens for quite a few pictures, I have to say that considering what I use it for, I can't imagine paying 3 times as much for a quality that I really can't tell at my level of photography. Reading what other reviewers wrote, I can see where they get that it feels light and cheap. However that's exactly what I expected from a lens at this price.

"20111029","4.0","Noticeably Sharper (less soft) Than Canon's ef-s Kit Lens","After using this lens for the past few days, I found that this lens made sharper (or less soft) pictures than what my Canon EF-S 18-55mm IS kit lens (not the ii lens introduced with the Rebel T3i/T3 in July 2011) could do mounted on my 6 MP Digital Rebel (300D).I shot, using a remote control, over 2 dozen pictures on each lens, focusing on an eye and eye glass frame standing 6 feet away on a tripod indoor near a doorwall at 1pm on a cloudy day.  The kit lens was set at 34/35 mm (its optimum sharpness).  The camera was set to use Program mode for both lens at iso 100.  This resulted in the settings of f4.5, 1/30 or 1/40 sec. exposure on the kit lens and f2.2 or f2.5, 1/100 or 1/80 sec exposure on the 50mm lens.Using Canon's Digital Photo Professional 3.9.2.0, jpg pictures were produced from the RAW files.  Both Luminance Noise reduction and unsharp mask strength were set to zero (and other settings left unchanged).Comparing the results by flipping quickly between each lens picture, I noticed right away that the 50 mm lens was sharper (less soft).The pictures' contrast was the same from each lens.This lens is slightly louder when focusing than the kit lens.I did this review hoping to provide relevant information for people like me who only shoot family pictures and have only the kit lens as a frame of reference for sharpness comparison.BTW, those that have the original Canon kit lens WITHOUT the IS should seriously look into getting the IS version.

"20111028","5.0","Big performance in a small pakage.","This lens is the quintessential idiom debunker. For an $80 lens you get way more that you paid for. My L lenses (although variable focus) are ten time as expensive and this lens has a comparable performance and image quality. There is no edge distortion with this lens and the 1.8 F stop lets you do some creative work. I do have one problem with it though. It definitely does not have a quiet motor. For taking photos in a quiet environment like a church or wedding you're better off with manual focus, once it loses focus and has to cycle through its range it will let everyone in the room know. Also if you use it to shoot video you will hear it on the footage, so manual focus would be the better option there as well. Shooting in the sun without the capability of attaching a hood to it does become a headache so get yourself a universal one size fits all hood. This lens has a four star performance and I gave it a five purely because of the combination of performance and price.""
"20111028","5.0","Great Lens!","Bang for the buck, this lens is near impossible to beat. I've had mine for maybe four or five years now and it has seen regular usage with three different camera bodies. It's not the most versatile lens you'll own but when you need a fast, sharp prime lens, this one will not let you down. The 1.4 is certainly higher quality and slightly faster but it costs four times as much. This lens produces a very pleasant bokeh at wider apertures and there is no distortion or vignetting, just very sharp, beautiful images. If you have a Canon EOS, I'd recommend this as one of you're first additions to your kit!""
"20111028","5.0","Great lens for the price","This is a great lens for the price.  You can get amazing depth of field.  You can get images with this that are just impossible to replicate with a P&S camera or a phone camera.  I highly recommend if you are buying a SLR to get the body only and then this lens.  Use the money you saved to get a nicer lens then the kit lens.  That way you have an amazing lens for shallow depth of field work/low light and a lens with a little more pop then the kit lens.""
"20111027","5.0","Great value, beautiful photos!","I am a very amateur photographer! I had been wanting to move from my dependence on the semi-automatic settings like P and Av to full manual.  This lens has been very easy to learn on.  The shallow depth of field and bokeh I get on the larger aperature settings are so lovely.  I'm finding that most of my pictures taken with this lens need very little post-processing because they come out of the camera looking so great!  Plus, it is so light and compact that this has become my go-to lens for throwing my camera in my purse for the day! For a hundred bucks, you can't beat it!""
"20111026","5.0","Invest in this Prime.","I'm a noob when it comes to film, but this was my first lens when I started DSLR shooting. It's a great prime lens with awesome aperture!!If it's your first lens, I highly recommend this for its 100-150 dollar price range. A higher end, alternative is a 30mm Prime.However, prime lenses have specific uses as their focal points are limited. If you're looking for a more versatile work-horse, being your first lens,I highly recommend grabbing a 18-55mm EFS lens for about the same price. That piece of hardware will serve you in many more ways than a 50mm prime (in several circumstances)If you want to run on a single lens for a while without having to invest, however; I would also recommend looking at 18-135mm Zoom lens--that is a fantastic starting range.Before anything else, I have to remind you that the f-stop or aperture for those lens are higher than 1.8/2; they are around 4.0 - 5.6. This means that they will work poorerin lower Lum conditions. There are always more expensive lenses to invest in.But this 50mm prime, as well as, the other lenses I mentioned are great entry level hardware.""

I'm a novice photographer whose previous lens was a Canon EF 35-80mm f/4-5.6 lens.  The difference between the two lenses is night and day...literally.  I avoid flash photography as I don't have the equipment to make the pictures look natural, so I was always taking pictures with the flash off.  So many pictures turned out dark, blurry, or both.  I wondered how much difference a wider aperture would make.  I got the f/1.8 and was blown away.  I'm taking sharper pictures in good light, and can now get them in low indoor light conditions as well.  Your kids only grow up once, don't miss a shot, get a lens with a wide aperture.  ,and for the money, this one probably can't be beat.  I wish I had it years ago.(,and if you're wondering if I miss the zoom function?...I don't.  It doesn't take many steps to frame the shot you want.  The quality pictures more than make up for it.)""

I bought this lens as a good indoor lens for birthday parties, weddings, and candid shots.  It doesn't have a telephoto zoom, which limits its uses, but if you own a high megapixel camera you can crop the image afterwords and still have plenty of resolution for your typical 4x6 or 5x7 size photos.Be warned, it's an EF lens not EFS so your view finder is going to be much more narrow than you might expect from a 50mm if you are using it in a digital SLR.  Again, for candid shots and portraits you'll be fine.  And with f/1.8 the depth of field is amazing.  With my other lens, I had to zoom to 85mm at f/5.8 to get the same frosty background I could achieve with this lens.It's not a perfect lens, and the plastic body makes me a little nervous, but it's tiny and super light and for around $100?!?  I can afford another one if this one breaks =).  Sure the USM f/1.4 might have a stronger body and slightly faster focus and shudder but it's also 3x the price.  Pro's might go with the 1.4 but any intermediate or hobbyist needs one of these in their bag.""

"20111020","2.0","Play Fair","A two star rating translates to, 'I don't like it!'  What I don't like isn't the lens but the fact that it is advertised as the List Price being $200.00.  The suggested MFR on the Canon USA site is $125.99, not $200.00. Currently this lens is selling for $119.99 ($10.00 off) at a couple of big electric stores.  In other words you don't save $95.32 as illustrated by Amazon. You save $21.81.  Obviously this is a very big difference between the two calculations.I have recently purchased a number of items through Amazon and I will probably continue in the future, which will most likely included this lens.  I felt that I should bring this to the customers attention of the false advertisement.  Hopefully Amazon.com will attempt to give an accurate quote as to how much you save, when you deal with them.  I think this is only fair and honest for them to do this for their customers and their reputation.Update! On the 10th of November, I bought this lens from a pawn shop for about the same price as a new one.  The reason I went for a used one was because it was made in Japan.  The current '50mm f1.8 ll' are made in Malaysia.  It was on a 35mm Rebel xS film camera.  I'm assuming that my lens is the older version.  I will keep the body in my vehicle in the event that I'm in a thrift store and they have lenses for sale, I can check to see if the lens is compatible, etc.The lens takes very nice sharp shots.

The casing is made of plastic, but it doesn't feel like a 'toy' as is so often reported. Furthermore, I don't find the operation of the lens to be overly loud, as is also often noted. Sure you can hear it operate, but to me is doesn't seem loud.The auto focus is quick and the lens takes gorgeous photos with a super shallow depth of field which is perfect for the type of shooting I do. I also do a lot of low light shooting and with this lens you can skip the flash. I was amazed at how little light you actually need to shoot great photos indoors.

It's definitely on the choppy side of things.- I've read that with low-end lenses like this, if you purchase one and it's not very good, return it and then buy the exact same lens again to see if your results improve. Apparently quality and how well a particular lens works with your body are not consistent from one copy to the next. Interesting. I must have gotten a good copy. By the way, I'm using a Rebel XSi, so it's not like I have a fantastic body that somehow compensates for deficiencies in the lens.Overall, this lens is exactly what I want: cheap, and the shortcuts Canon took to make it so aren't really an issue for me.

"20111003","4.0","The Fantastic Plastic lens that no Canon beginner should be without!","I bought the 50mm f/1.8 lens was the first lens I picked up when I bought my first DSLR, the Canon XTi, back in 2006.  I was a beginner who had saved my pennies for quite some time to invest in a fancy camera.  The entry level body was all I could afford, but I had done my homework and knew that the kit lens was supposed to be a glorified paperweight.  I wanted something else instead, but I didn't have a lot of money to drop on a lens.  I read a ton of reviews and determined that this little lens was the best possible choice.I remember picking this up for about $80 and the gentleman who sold it to me called it Canon's 'fantastic plastic' lens.  The build of the lens resembles that of a toy more than a piece of high-grade camera equipment.  It is VERY lightweight and the plastic body is definitely more delicate than the average Canon lens.  This makes it great for carrying around in your camera bag, but you must take some care when you have it out and about.  I've never dropped mine, but I can imagine that this lens would be destroyed if it fell on a hard surface from a height of three feet or more.It is a fixed length lens, so you're losing some of the flexibility of using a zoom lens.  In my opinion, though, prime (fixed) lenses are superior to zooms.  They tend to produce sharper photographs and I think they teach the photographer to work better with the space they have when they are composing a photograph.  I've always thought that zoom lenses make for lazy photographers, although there are obviously exceptions to that rule.I love this because of the f/1.8 wide aperture.  I was doing a lot of photography in small, dark music venues of live music performances.  Concert photography is difficult to begin with, but I was getting great shots shooting with this lens wide open with a shutter speed of 1/60.  This lens is perfect for low-light photography.It is not a completely silent lens, though, when you're enabling autofocus and the focus ring 'creaks' a little bit when it is focusing.  95% of the time it isn't loud enough to bother anyone, but in a very quiet setting where the photographer is trying to be inconspicuous, this may pose a problem.  It is something to take into consideration.The only reason a photographer should not have this lens in his or her kit is if they have upgraded to the 50mm f/1.4 or the 50mm f/1.2 L.  I think a 50mm focus length is the most versatile walkaround lens available.  You'll be shocked at the color balance and the sharpness of the photographs you make, right out of the camera.  Just stunning.  Especially when you consider that this is the cheapest lens in the Canon line.For amateurs and professionals alike, this is a great choice when picking out a Canon lens.""

However, when I went to remove the lens from the camera, I started having problems.When I pressed the lens release button and turned the lens, it would rotate counterclockwise, but it would stop halfway. It stops rotating at a position in which it's not possible to remove the lens. After about an hour of trying to remove the lens, I called Canon customer service and sent the camera, with lens attached, for repair.After calling Canon, I looked online and found just a few references to similar problems with this lens, one of them being another Amazon customer/reviewer, A. Gupta. So this seems to be an uncommon (but not rare) occurrence. I wish I had spent more time experimenting with the lens to have a better opinion of it.Right now, my biggest fear is having my camera suffer permanent damage because of this. After this experience, I can't say whether I'll gamble and give this lens a second shot.""
"20110920","5.0","Great lens","I bought this after reading a review at Amazon, although the construction quality might be tougher, it is an excellent lens.""
"20110920","5.0","A must have","Interesting set of options to rate - looks like the hackers have gotten to it.  Anyway, this is a great lens, especially for the cost.  Delivers consistently sharp images and is great in low light.  The 1.8 is to die for.  Granted, I don't prefer fixed lenses, but in this case I make an exception.  I have a 40D, and did not have a problem getting the lens on and off.  I think that issue must have been with the earlier versions of the lens.  Get one!""
"20110919","5.0","Amazing","I love this lens. I also adore the price! That was the main reason why I decided to try it out. I've always wanted a lens that was able to have a blurred background, with a f-stop of 1.8, it works wonders.""
"20110919","5.0","I'm lovin' it","I was initially very hesitant to purchase this lens.  I have heard so many awesome things about it, but also some horror stories.  My biggest concern was that this little lens could possibly somehow become stuck to my camera body and the only apparent remedy is to destroy the lens and possibly inflict collateral damage to the camera body in the process.  (Just Google 50mm 1.8 stuck on xsi.)  A coworker bought one second hand and said he didn't have any problems with his, so I got up the nerve to borrow his and tried it out for a day, and I really liked it.So after price watching for quite some time I finally ordered one when I saw it at the cheapest it has been in awhile.  It hasn't gotten stuck on my camera, yet!  I was thorough in inspecting it prior to mounting to the body, and all appeared normal, no loose screws, it seems intact.  I carefully locked and unlocked several times without issue.  One thing I did notice, which caused me slight alarm, was what appears to be an air bubble within the glass, just slightly off centre.  I took several test photos and scrutinized the pictures, and it does not appear to be noticeable from what I can see.  This could be more of an issue in bright sunlight.  Not having owned a fast prime like this before, I am still getting used to it, especially in bright daylight where I found it near impossible to shoot wide open without blowing everything out.  I found that I had to stop down to f2.2 or more just to retain some highlight.  Other reviews have also cited focus issues, namely hunting in low light and front or back focus problems.  Unlike the unit I borrowed to test which was front focussing, my copy focusses dead on where I aim the centre dot.  Hunting in low light is an issue, and manual focus may be a better option if faced with that issue.  The focus ring is small, but it isn't unmanageable for me.  And focus motor noise is loud!Overall, I am very impressed with this little piece of glass (and plastic).  In terms of bang for your buck, this lens delivers images that are tack sharp with dreamy bokeh at 1/4 the price of it's 1.4 cousin.  I think the good outweighs the negatives of this lens.  If this ever breaks I will definately be upgrading to the 1.4, but for now its a cheap way to get into the groove of fixed focal length photography.  So far I am very happy I took the gamble on this!""
"20110919","5.0","excellent both in terms of quality and price","That's the best canon lens for the money. Sharp, with nice colors and decent bokeh. My only complaint is lack of IS and sometimes inaccurate AF. But for this price you will not find a better lens.""
"20110918","4.0","Bad Copy?","I am on my third copy of this lens. The first was not sharp. Sent it back. The second was all everyone promises. Sadly, I threw that lens in with a camera sale because now, on my third copy, I am back to wishing I had the second one back. I will probably sell this one and try to get another good copy. Moral of the story, I think the build is inconsistent.""

Yes it's plastic but it doesn't necessarily feel cheap. The first test shots were pretty awesome. The f/1.8 works great. It seems like it works well in low-light conditions thanks to the wide aperture. The AF isn't as fast as other lenses but still takes great shots. For the price you really can't go wrong with it, any photographer will love it. The lens overall works great with my 60d and I would recommend it to anyone.""

"20110909","5.0","Canon's best cheap lens","Okay, I will make this short, just a bit of my experience after using this lens.-Produces sharp images and awesome bokeh-Great portrait lens-f/1.8 is very useful under low light settings-$106!!! produces high quality pictures! Cheaper than all the lens I have bought-super light weighted, I loveeeee the light weighted with my canon 7d. After using the canon 18-200mm lens, I realized the disadvantage of weight. Before, I dont think the weight of a lens is a big deal, but IT IS after carrying for hours...-50mm is more than enough to do almost anything. I learned to zoom in and out with my feet =)There are some cons like its plastic material, but cant really expect the same quality as the 'L' lens when the price is only around $100.This lens is on my camera 80% of the time. I also bought a rubber lens hood with this lens, and it works like a charm altogether. I definitely recommend every canon dslr owners to buy this lens, you will not regret it!""

"20110907","4.0","Good starter lens for recreational photographers","I'll start off by saying I'm no pro.  I don't know if I would even call myself much of an amateur, what I am is a recreational photographer.  I take pictures of my kitties when they're being adorable, photograph my various arts and crafts projects to keep a record of them and take my camera with me to parties and on vacations.  Though I have taken photography classes I don't aspire to be Ansel Adams; my estimation of a good photo is one I would make my computer desktop background(High praise, indeed) ;^)With all that said, I bought the Canon 50mm f/1.8 for its low light capabilities, it's sharpness and in hopes that on an upcoming vacation I could get some wicked photos of the night sky and constellations in the southern hemisphere.  My first camera had only a fixed 50mm lens and this brought back great memories of my high school photography class.With the goal of being able to take night-sky photos, I took the camera down the street to a park one night and set it up on my tripod and started snapping away.  This camera has such an ability to pick up light that, when turned on the park grasses with only stret lamp light a block away and the camera stopped down to a -2 exposure the grass was still burnt out in the photo!  I had to reduce exposure time to 2 seconds to get a good photo of the grasses and if I went above 10 to 15 second exposure times on the sky the city lights would burn out all the stars in the sky! (Though I live in a pretty populated metropolitan suburb, and, sidenote, be sure to remove the lens cap before taking photos - ah, the lessons we learn...)I took it to the state fair recently, it's first official outting, and was generally happy with it. It was lightweight - much more so than my 75-300mm zoom lens and a little more so than the 18-55mm lens that comes with the Rebel XS - so it was easy to carry, which I liked. The barns are usually pretty dark and glary because of the bright sunlight outside but I was able to get good exposures of the animals, even after I realized I had my camera stopped down to a -1 exposure (oops!).  Some of the photos turned out a tiny bit dark but that can easily be corrected in a photo editing program and none of the photos I kept were so bad I had to edit them before posting them to facebook.The auto-focus did have a little trouble picking up what I was trying to focus on at times, but in the process of tyring to get it to focus I did manage to get a very blurry photo demonstrating the pentagonal/hexagonal bokeh (the blur effect).  This was the only photo I got that had noticable 'not round' bokeh in it, in all my other photos the backgrounds are nice and soft.  I also had a little trouble focusing when I was taking photos of the night sky, though that has partially to do with the fact that the screen was ruining my night vision looking through the view finder (need to figure out how to turn it off...) and the weird, skyward angle of my camera on the tripod.  Auto-focus is also kind of loud when it's hunting around but not unacceptable when it's making smaller corrections.A quick aside on the focal depth, I was playing around with the lens when I first received it in the mail and taking photos of my cats (a notoriously difficult task with the best of lenses) and got a photo of my kitty's eyes, sharp as a tack at f/1.8, and noticed even on the screen of the camera I could see his ears were beginning to blur and his nose was ever so slightly beginning to blur.  That's the depth of the f/1.8 stop!  An exciting prospect, but also a warning if you autofocus has the kind of sense of humor mine does - use your imagination on that one. =^PBecause I have a Canon Rebel XS, the 50mm lens is actually more like a 75mm (because of the sensor inside the camera the actual focal length of the lenses is 1.6x its advertised focal length) which I found a little limiting when trying to take photos of my family with the animals at the fair - I couldn't get back far enough to get the animal and person in the photo with a nice composition, but hey, that's what you get with a fixed lens.  It's also a bummer that it takes 52mm filters and my other two lenses take 58mms but that's a matter of buying a $5 converter ring.My last main critique of the lens would be that I would have really appreciated if Canon had included Image Stabalization in this lens.  I don't know if that's only something they put in the zoom lenses (the $400 50mm f/1.4 lens also doesn't have IS) but it would have saved my bacon when I was photographing the equestrian drill teams at the fair where the light is even worse than in the barns and the action really fast - I couldn't get freeze-frame shots very often, but again, that may have more to do with my abilities than the lens.  It also would have been really helpful with the kids and piglets and baby cows that like to move around a lot more than the older animals do.Overall, though, I think it's a good lens to get for the beginning photographer interested in the fixed 50mm lens, or the amateur not willing to pay $400 for the better build quailty and slightly lower f-stop.  Great to get for your kids if they are taking a photography class (I'd say a must for anyone in a photography class!) because of the price point.  Keep in mind the sensor/1.6x focal length issue and see if your camera also has this feature - not hugely limiting but something to be aware of in general.  I'm very satasfied with my purchase, knowing that I didn't get the deluxe lens my expectations have been met so far.  It's good for my purposes, is a great low-cost lens and, my own limitations not withstanding, you can do some amazing photography with it if you know even a little about photography!""

"20110904","3.0","Great....At A (BIG) Price","I owned this lens for a few years, and yes, it took excellent pictures for this price point and expectations. HOWEVER, it is of such horrible build that having it on your camera may be fatal.The plastic construction fell apart on the inside and made it absolutely impossible to remove from the lens mount. Tried everything, brought to camera stores, everything...the only solution, twist plastic really hard and hope it doesn't damage the metal lens mount on the body. Sadly, I now have a Canon camera body that is useless as the AF doesn't work and it turns off at certain apertures.So...if you are very careful with this lens, don't keep it on the body and need to save money, do it. Otherwise, pay more for the more solid construction...it may end up saving you money.""

"20120507","5.0","EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.","I got this as a gift for Christmas, and I can confidently say that this was one of my favorite gifts of all time! I'm kind of a hobbyist and am using a Canon XS. The kit lens that came with the XS was good, but I wanted a wider aperture. Once I put this lens onto my camera and learned how to use it properly (still learning, of course ;D), I didn't want to put my kit lens back on. And I haven't yet.Pros****-Price - This is a FANTASTIC lens for the price. Of course, I don't have a handful of lenses to compare this to, but I can confidently say that what I got from this lens was definitely worth the price. As a student, and as a hobbyist, I couldn't justify having myself, or anyone else, spend a lot on a lens for me. Sure, the f/1.4 might be better, and sure, I'll get it eventually, but I don't have an extra $200 to spend at the moment, since I don't have a full time job. In the end, I might be paying more to get this lens first, and then buy the better one when I'm actually employed, but I simply can't afford the 1.4 right now. If you're NOT on a budget, then by all means, dish out the extra for the f/1.4. Also, you can sell this 1.8 on ebay for a really good price if you choose to upgrade later, if it makes your decision any easier.-Sharp and clear! Sooo nice. Just remember that if you shoot at f/1.8 and decide to halfway depress the shutter to focus and then recompose your shot, your results might not be as sharp. This isn't really a fault of the lens, but the fact that you're shooting at f/1.8.-Wide aperture: SO lovely. It's excellent for portraits, or whenever else you might want to isolate your subject from the background. It CAN be a tad soft wide open, but it's not a huge issue for most people, especially since this is an inexpensive lens. And if you're a professional, you probably won't be looking at this lens anyways. On the plus side, the softness wide open can be nice for portraits.-Eats light for breakfast. This lens is fast. You can shoot in lower light conditions, compared to the standard kit lens.-Light and compact!Cons*****-Plastic construction: Not a huge issue for me. I honestly don't think it feels cheap, but I'm not a pro and have not used many lenses. It might feel cheap in comparison to those, but for someone who upgraded from a kit lens, it's fine. Just be careful and hope you're lucky? I haven't had mine fall apart yet (or get stuck to my camera, as several reviewers had issues with), so my fingers are still crossed. I've had this for 5 months so far. Also, I feel like most people know this, but don't fidget with the focus ring if it's on AF.-Loud AF: Whrr whhhrr whhhrrrrr. You won't be hiding in bushes, getting sneak shots of people anyways, right?! It's not a huge deal, but sometimes, the AF is so loud as its struggling to focus in lower light situations, I just want to put the lens out of its misery and set it to manual. But it's really not a deal killer for me. I'll let the whirring noises make my presence known!Side Notes**********There's no zoom, but it's a prime lens, so that's a given. Learning to move yourself (or your subject ;D) can lead to interesting results, compared to standing in place and letting zoom take care of everything for you. Moving from my kit lens to this lens made me feel a little naked at first, but I don't miss zoom.You can get up to around 1.5 feet distance from your subject. I keep wanting to get closer, so this is something I'm trying to get used to.Also, I use a Canon XS, so with the 50mm, things feel a little 'tight' since the XS isn't a full-frame camera. The 50mm on my XS is more like an 80mm on a full-frame camera.It might be tricky to get shots of people in small spaces where you can't back up enough to get enough of them in the frame.Anyways, if you're on a budget or are a hobbyist, this lens is a great buy. Especially if you're moving from a kit lens, you'll be amazed at what this little guy can do. =D""
"20120506","5.0","Cheap build quality but amazing pictures","If you are still shooting with your kit lense--stop. The f/1.8 fixed aperature on this 50mm will take you into another world of indoor photography without the need of a flash. Although its not the best build quality, it will deliver amazing shots in low light. I was satisfied with my original 18-55 kit lense until I bought this lense. Now that I have seen near-pro quality images from my own camera, I will never use the kit lense again. In fact, sitting next to this lense in my camera bag is my newest lense purchase: a Canon 70-200L F4.Now that I have 'seen the light,' I don't think I could ever buy anything but 'L' glass for my Canon.

Then it literally came apart in my hand one day, with no falls, abuse, etc.  I've had the lens about 10 months.  Usage was moderate.If you don't have the several hundred for the better one, this is a fun lens for your collection at a very accessible price, but keep the warranty info, treat it with extra extreme care and don't ever try and pick up your camera by the lens and hopefully it will last!""

I've encountered a couple of situations where it's hard to get far enough back to fit the full picture in the frame.  But, the upside is that taking close-ups is that much easier with this lens.""
"20110903","3.0","Great value lens to begin with, but don't count on it staying that way....","First of all, my star rating explained: 5 stars initial rating, 1 star today rating, equals 3 stars for this current review. Yes for $100 you get some great image quality. I bought this lens 5 years ago for photography classes, and for the most part I've been pleased...as a cheap f/1.8 it was the go-to lens for low light situations. That said, it is pretty terrible at autofocusing in low light. But again, it's only $100 right?The lens feels very cheap and light, but I didn't mind the build quality much, and assumed anyone who was breaking the lens was too hard on this non-pro equipment. Well, I opened my camera bag this morning to find the front element of the lens detached from the body. The rear element fell off as well. This lens was sitting in my bag, on a shelf, and I didn't notice anything wrong when I placed the lens in my bag after my last time using it.Maybe I wasn't quite gentle enough when I placed the bag on the shelf? Or maybe the lens reached its expiration date and self-destructed? Not sure, but I've been planning to upgrade to the f/1.4 anyway, so Amazon watch for my order soon.Looking back 5 years, if I were to purchase an initial 50mm again, I would skip the junk and go for the f/1.4, and I suggest the same for anyone considering these lenses. If you buy the f/1.8, you will end up paying more eventually...either for repairs and/or replacement, or for the inevitable upgrade to the f/1.4.""

"20110827","4.0","Good lens for the price!!!!","This is my first EF lens and my second prime lens. Lens weighs lot lighter than my Tokina M35 2.8. Lens has a huge aperture, phenomenal opening. All the reviews out their complaining about poor build quality and sluggish auto focus, well those are all correct. You get what you pay for. I would use this for Av mode and to utilize it's 1.8 F value. Pictures come out very sharp with very high shutter speed. Most people buy this for portraits and bokeh is out of the world! Simply amazing bokeh! However, for F between 1.8 and 2.2 I would strongly recommend to have a very good understanding of the distance between you and the subject how far you have behind the subject. Depth of field is what makes or breaks this lens. Having the subject within 2 to 3 feet you are bound to get that blur edge around chin and cheek at F1.8. As far as I have seen it gets better as you go over 4  feet or if you go up a few stops. Great lens for the money, it is very light. If you like to take point and shoot of people then this is a great all purpose lens. Angle of view is a limiting factor 43 or 46 degrees I believe. Not a lot of coverage when it comes to width.""
"20110827","3.0","Could be better","I've been waiting for getting this lens since last year's christmas. Since I am from Venezuela, it isn't easy to find this stuff at a reasonable price out here. I've read lots of reviews. The ones who praised the lens for being a bargain and the ones who said that it was crap.It surely isn't crap at all, I don't think it looks like a toy, the construction is ok. Although I haven't tried it like it should, so I can't say much about the image quality, just that the autofocus is lame. There's one thing that I have to say, and that pretty annoys me, it is the fact that it has moving parts in the outside of the lens when it is in autofocus mode, that creates lots of opportunities for the lens to be damaged by any bad movement or something like that. As an owner of a 24mm f2.8, I thought that it had a similar system, when being in auto focus, the ring is simply for decoration, so you can't do anything in that moment. Well, I'm an amateur, and there's maybe another review about it, or there's a group called 'I really like canon ef50mm f1.8 because it has moving parts outside', but, well, that what's I think.""

"20110824","5.0","Cool pictures, I was not able to take these before!!","I'm still new to the whole photography thing, so this review is for those amateurs like me that want awesome pictures, but are not looking to become a professional....Having said that, this lens is awesome! for about a $100 I am able to get some really cool pictures with a shallow deept-of-field that I was not able to get with other more expensive lenses.I uploaded some of the pictures taken with the lens, mine are the ones with the white maltese. His name is 'Euro'So I got some really nice shots of Euro using the biggest aperture (1.8)Pros:-Dirt cheap lens, the least expensive in my bag, and the smallest one, so footprint is minimal-Decent sharpness for a lens of this price, I use a Canon 60D, and this lens has nothing to envy some of the other lenses I have when it comes to image quality. And yes, I do have a couple of 'L' lenses-The huge aperture is the best thing about this lens, it lets you take some cool portraits that blur the background like a pro-Light and very portable. This lens can fit in my back pocket (probably not a good idea) but it is so small and light that it really is no problem to just toss it in your bag along with your other stuff.Cons:-Construction of the lens is not sturdy, all plastic, feels like a toy, not a real Canon EF lens.-Auto-focus is loud as hell, since this is NOT a USM lens, when using the auto-focus, the lens makes a loud noise as it focuses into the subject. The focus motor of the lens is just loud, and the plastic structure does not help.-(Obviously) the 50mm only is tough to work with, having to step back or forth to get to the right crop/frame you want.All in all, it is a great lens for the value, $100 bucks and you have a lens you can use in just about any portrait situation, the pictures it produces are really nice and well worth the cash. I consider it a must for my humble camera bag, and yes, there are lens like it that can do it better, but at this price? Which is why I give it an undisputed 5 stars!!""
"20110824","5.0","Everyone should have this","This is one of the best lens that cannon has produced. It gives you the L lens picture quality at dirt cheap price. It is a very good lens for Portrait. I will say, if you are starting in Photography, then ditch the zoom lens and start with this. You will learn and improve you composition.""
"20110823","5.0","Uber Pleased!","Although I only had this lens for two weeks.I was some what skeptical about the lens at first;being so cheap in addition tothe materials being used to make this lens. However,when I used this lens to shoot at the 'House on the Rock,'images were sharp and bright.  Bokeh was not at all distractinglike some reviews, and the Pin (focus) was right on the dot.I used this lens with Canon Eos 5dm2 and will keep this on my camera fora very long time.""
"20110823","4.0","Great Value, But Not Necessarily The Ideal Lens For You","I purchased this lens around 6 months ago and have since shot thousands upon thousands (upon thousands, I need a life) of pictures with it.  The value is tremendous, so tremendous that it's almost impossible to ignore.  If you're uncertain about whether or not photography is for you, this lens is a great way to introduce yourself to the wonderful world of super-shallow depth-of-field.  That said, if you're fairly certain that photography is a hobby you want to pursue, I would suggest at least considering moving up to the more expensive EF f1.4 50mm lens from Canon.  The f1.8, for all of its wonderful features, is held back by a very mediocre autofocus.  It can be incredibly difficult to get it to focus, even in well lit situations where other lenses would have no difficulties.  Manual focus is always an option but the focus ring is small, and even if you have perfect vision this can be a challenge.  The f1.8 has also had a tendency to burn out highlights with a pinkish tint when shooting wide open, which can be frustrating.This lens is incredibly good, and is a terrific bargain, but there is a very real reason that the more expensive f1.4 lens exists, and in retrospect I wish I had bought it instead!""
"20110823","1.0","It's waste money","I already wrote some note that lens motor made some noise when I got this lens. Two months after, a front part of lens which was moving for focus fell out of the lens. And then I can't put this back, I tried but camera said lens sensor error. I can't take a picture any more with this lens. Please Don't buy this lens. You may be waste your money like me. I don't know they can fix for me. Where can I contact???""

"20110821","2.0","Not a Fan","This was my first lens purchase and i was looking for something cheap but that still produce quality images. My initial response was that this was a great lens and totally worth my money (120 or so) but after using it on a few sessions I am not as pleased with the performance. The first thing i noticed when i took it out of the box is how light (and cheap) it felt. As noted in other reviews this lens contains no metal. Though mine hasn't become stuck to my camera as a few unfortunate others it still feels cheap. This lens does offer a nice depth of field with the 1.8 aperture but i am not a fan of the auto focus feature on this lens. Though i can focus manually, when shooting a fast subject, such as children, where the auto focus would come in handy, this lens falls a bit flat. I notice that unless i manually focus each shot that about 3 out of 5 images will be slightly out of focus. This lens did seem nice and sharp at the beginning but I am not as impressed anymore. If i had to do it over again I would have spent a bit more money to make sure i was getting real quality and reliable lens.""
"20110821","5.0","Perfect little "fast" starter lens","Ok, so this isn't the highest quality lens. It's plastic and might not survive a rough environment, but for the price, it makes an excellent starter if you don't want to spend a lot of money.  I would recommend this lens to anyone looking to shoot in low light situations without the high cost of something more expensive.""
"20110821","5.0","Perfect for portraits and low-light shots... as well as for your wallet!","You can't go wrong with this lens. Because I am not a professional photographer who gets paid to shoot, my budget is limited. This lens is one of the least expensive, quality lenses that could find. The result will surprise you.This lens is now my favorite when shooting portraits. Because of its wide aperture, you can really blur the background, even indoors. It's great for low-light shots for the same reason (wide-aperture).I highly recommend this lens to all amateur photographers as their first prime lens. Some people compare this lens with the more expensive lenses but I don't think you can compare apples with oranges because this lens is not in the same price range as other lenses.""
"20110820","5.0","Happy Amateur","As an amateur looking to become a hardcore hobbyist, I was looking for some glass that was cheap, easily accessible and easy to handle; and most of all, easy to learn to use. While I'm sure the 1.4 has much better quality and glass, this is great for someone in my range.The bokeh on this lens is quite surprising and I'm pretty pleased with the way photos of my subjects have turned out. A+It's a bit more compact than I imagined, but the lens itself is fairly large and it absorbs light like a horrible space void. (in a good way) I was able to take fabulous photos of fast moving subjects (ehmm, my cats) and have them turn out. (Subjects were relaxed and not playing, I'll have to test that some other time, but they sure do like to look around a lot)The auto focus noise is a bit crunchy, but I'm going to assume it's because the casing is heavy plastic and not metal.""
"20110818","5.0","An unbelievable value","It is absolutely incredible to me that a prime lens this good is this inexpensive -- and it's not just cheap on Amazon, either. It's just plain inexpensive. I have taken so many great images with this fast aperture lens, and they have turned out universally well (so long as I didn't mess up the settings).In terms of construction, it's plastic, which probably helps with the cost, but it's proved very durable so far. The lens seems surprisingly dust-resistant. I haven't had to wipe it down more than once in several weeks. The picture quality at shallow DOF is crystal clear on the object in focus, and it's very sharp. The colors are very well defined, as well.My main complaint about this lens is the significant chromatic aberration after f/8. Bright objects -- water droplets hitting the sun, gems glinting in bright light, very bright white shirts in the sun -- get a terrible, unfixable halo if you're trying for a small aperture.Indoor pictures are excellent with this lens, though of course it's a prime lens, so you're going to have to set up your own shots. Most of the time this has definitely not been an issue for me.""
"20110818","5.0","Great for beginners, like myself","I bought this lens for my used Canon A2E slr, and it works wonders. It has become my most used lens. It is a plastic lens, its obviously not the best-made lens out there. It does exactly what I need it to do.""
"20110818","5.0","Amazing lens for the price-a no brainer-get one!","After seeing the results of a similar lens on a Nikon D300s I decided to get the lens with a Fotodiox hood and 3 filter kit. I'm amazed of the results, especially considering the price. My friend paid 249 for the lens alone (Nikon). I paid 130 for the KIT. We could'nt resist comparing our lens and honestly, Canon's lens is as good as the Nikon. The Nikon is a tiny bit sharper (full cropping shows it) but the bokeh is better (alot) on the Canon. Colors and contrast are similar.Again, for the price, this is a no brainer-get it! The results are amazing, especially if your are using a kit lens and want a sharper, quicker, brighter lens.My Canond 60D with that piece produces photo good enough for magazine :-)""

An awesome upgrade from the kit lens. The built quality is a bit fragile but sturdy at the same time, easy to use -snap on and get started shooting.The picture quality is beyond great and the bokeh style images you'll be able to have is only limited to your creativity. If you think the f/1.4 is a bit too much for you then this is your solution.Perfect value, beyond any expectation.""
"20110816","5.0","Really worth the money","bought this a few months ago, I mainly use it for Portraiture and it takes really nice sharp pictures.I use it at F2.8 which this product seems to be perfect specially for the price compared to the other 50mm""
"20110816","3.0","Cheap, great image, but HORRIBLE auto focus","It's a 50mm prime. A lens that probably everyone with an SLR should have. It's crisp, and it's cheap. It's really a great buy.  Just know that the auto focus on this is unusable, and you will resort to leaving it on manual focus after about 5 minutes. Manual focusing isn't a bad option, it's just something to be aware of.""
"20110815","4.0","Excellent value for the money","Truly 'good' lenses start at $400, so you should probably know what to expect when buying a $100 lens. It's not going to be perfect, but this is a great performer for the price.Image quality (sharpness, lack of chromatic aberration etc.) is totally acceptable under good lighting and subject conditions. Under less than ideal conditions (wide dynamic range, high contract subjects etc), it doesn't fare quite as well, but that should be expected from a lens at this price.My biggest complaints? It feels cheap and light, almost toy-like, and consists of mostly plastic construction. Also, you can't help but notice how loud the autofocus is, it kind of took me by surprise at first. But again, for the price you expect such things!Bottom line - this is a great 'starter' lens, the price/performance simply cannot be beat.""
"20110811","5.0","Amazing Value When Used Correctly","First off, this is a amazing lens. In terms of bang-for-your-buck, it is worth every dollar. The construction is plastic, and it wont survive constant abuse. Just make sure to take care of the lens and practice focusing with its large aperture. You will not be disappointed.""
"20110811","5.0","Great lens","This lens has been on my camera for a month now, and I love it. I have always use a 70-200 f4L, but this little booger is sweet. Don't get me wrong, I love my 'Money Maker 70-200', but this little guy can REALLY throw the back out of focus with the 1.8.I have not seen the Pentagon shaped flares that I have read about when throwing the back out of focus, but I have also not had lights shining at me from back there.I am sure the L version, would have a better bokeh, but this guy has been great for me.I will probably get an L, but I figured for a little over 100 bucks, I could play with this focal legnth, and make sure I wanted one.""
"20110811","4.0","Everyone needs this lens!","Great image quality for any non-L lens. Very crisp focus for a non-USM. Has become my default portrait lens. For the price, it's so worth it!""
"20110811","5.0","Excellent photos!","Just like most of the other reviewers stated that you can't go wrong getting this lens. The 1.8 gives a depth of field that is beautiful for portraits, pets, flowers and objects. But remember, this is not a macro lens. I was also surprised by the sharpness. Although I am spoiled by the 18-55 wide angle versatility of the lens that came with my camera this lens takes better photos in sharpness and beauty. You have to step-back more often to get the shot. I think of it as an old school lens like when I had my first film SLR. I also got the recommended lens shade which also makes the lens look a little 'cooler' and adds protection. Of course, if you have a $1000 to burn then look for another lens but for this price, you get a lens that will give you professional looking results at a fraction of the cost of professional lenses!""
"20110810","3.0","Great if you are not a klutz","When I first got this lens, I didn't use it much. Then I started experimenting with it- and fell in love. The first film camera I ever owned had a 50mm lens on it, so I just had to go back to how I used to shoot. I had it for awhile...Then we were moving, and my camera took a spill onto the carpet and the lens broke. Not the glass, but the plastic. So once we got settled in our new place, I ordered another one.Within 48 hours it got broken. This time by my cat knocking it off the table onto the hardwood floor. Busted the bejesus out of it.So now I'm saving up for the $400 one- and hoping it's not as fragile as this one.PROS: It's super lightweight, making your camera more portable and easier to stow in your purse, and it's so short that you won't be knocking this lens into anything. The images are gorgeous- I LOVE the 50mm.CONS: Breaks EASILY!! Kinda loud too.""
"20110809","5.0","WOW!","Bought this lens as an upgrade to the 'kit lens' on my Canon Eos T1i, which came with a 18-55mm IS lens. I'm an amateur photographer, but the difference in image quality between the lenses makes my photos look professional every time. It allows me to shoot with natural light and avoid the harsh light from the built-in flash (haven't bought my Speedlite yet), producing stunning portraits of my infant daughter. It's lightweight, can comfortably carry it all day with camera over-the-shoulder or in a sling bag. I mounted this lens the day I got it and I seldom switch back to the 18-55 mm unless I know I will be in bright light and may not be able to move my feet to compose my shot. It's available for under $100 on sale, and will be the best money you've spent since buying your digital SLR!""

"20110808","3.0","I hope they are not all like this.","Received my 50mm f1.8 today and quickly packed it up an hour later for a return.  I received what I thought was a new in box retail lens.  This thing is so light, I thought they forgot the lens when they packed it.  Anyhow, I took a quick look at the glass before putting it on my camera and noticed that the rear glass had a partial finger print on it!  I was a little upset but not enough to ruin the purchase.  I put some time into cleaning it and it did come off.  I Inspected the glass again for any other marks and found three noticeable particles of dust inside the lens.  Is this common?  It certainly was unacceptable to me.  I took some shots to see if it was noticeable in my shots.  They are not as bad but if your looking for them, you can find them.  I can say that at f1.8, the photos are not very sharp, but still look good.  Move it up to f5 and up, the sharpness improves.  Now I have to decide whether to get another 1.8 and hope this was just a defect or go for the 1.4 and hope they've fixed the motor problem.""

"20110721","4.0","Not excellent, but good for its value","I own the Canon 60D with 15-85 and 70-300 L lens and also the Pentax k-x with numerous prime lenses. I spent a trip to Niagara Falls bringing this 50mm lens for its low-light capability and bokeh. After playing around with it I must say that I would not recommend it for those who are picky with their pictures. Only if you are on a very tight budget and just getting your feet wet with DSLR's, then it is a prime choice. No pun intended.First of all lets talk about its good qualities. Its cheap and very light. You dont notice the weight on the camera at all which makes it easier for walking around without getting tired. Thats a good thing because with this prime lens, your feet does the zooming. Speaking of which, the 50mm focal length (on a APS-C sensor) is just a tad beyond normal viewing angle. Meaning, if you loop your fingers into a circle and put it over your eye, then thats the image you get with this lens. This focal length is good for waist-high portraits without moving back too far. Because of the wide aperture of 1.8, this means its good for parties and indoor get togethers where one could take candid shots. I wouldn't recommend it for group shots, the image circle is a bit too tight. The best sharpness comes around f/4 to f/5.6, which is superb in resolution, and it is great starting at f/2.4. Couple this with minimal chromatic aberation and pictures can really pop at you against a blurry background. The build quality is ok, its plastic yes, but just be careful with it. Your money is going into the optical design. If you really want to have fun with this lens then I suggest a google search for 'bokeh hearts'. You will get endless questions from your friends!Ahhh but no lens is perfect and this is clearly one of them. For those who know bokeh (Japanese for blurry), this lens might disappoint you. Surely its capable of creating it easily with its wide aperture, but its very 'nervous' looking both in front and back out of focus planes, far from buttery smooth. Highlights are nice and round at f/1.8, but quickly turn into pentagons with anything above that. Couple this with the observation that contrast and color are dull at the widest aperture. then your best images are not going to be at its acclaimed low-light capability. How much so? Well, it steadily gets better to f/4, and thats the aperture that I would call excellent for this lens. Shots against the sun will get you prone to flare and washed out images, especially if you have a Tiffen UV filter, which most people get with this lens.So there you have it. This lens has its pros and cons, but its a good value for starters. It would be my recommendation as the first prime lens to get to see if you like the use of primes. If you have any L lenses, then you probably already know that the 50mm 1.4 and 1.2 are increasingly better. Oh, if you find 50mm focal length too zoomed in then the 35mm f/2 is similar and a little wider. Hope this helps!""

"20110717","5.0","excellent addition","Photography has been a hobby for about 2 years, but I didn't upgrade from my p&s to my DSLR until 6 months ago. I'm a relatively new photographer, but I use my camera very often and have taken more than 15,000 photos with my Canon Rebel T2i ever since! I'm becoming a more serious photographer, so getting a new lens was a must. This 50mm is a great choice for newbies who are looking for something that can deliver photos of better quality and add to their experience in photography. Working with a prime lens is different and can be more challenging since it isn't quite as versatile. I have been loving it so far though! I love the sharpness in my photos, and I've noticed the difference in sharpness and color between this lens and the kit lens. My photos with the kit lens just aren't as vibrant, and the difference gets more noticeable with practice. The 50mm is also great for indoor low-light settings, as you can shoot at faster shutter speeds because of the wider aperture. The only downside to this lens is that it's not a great choice when shooting people in short-range or landscapes. Unless you want closeup portraits or just shoulder-up portraits. But oftentimes I find that for special occasions where you want to capture full body or group portraits, this isn't the best choice lens. It also feels cheap, and it can be difficult to manually focus. Nonetheless, I'm in love with its quality and the amazing images I've gotten out of it! I always try to use it more than my 18-55mm kit lens because the quality is just that much better and saves me so much time in post-processing & editing.""

I got it May 2010 and June 2011 it has separated without any abuse(or use for that matter on my part). Reached for it in my bag and it halved itself. When I got it it was $99 now $119. Since I'm shooting with a 1.6 factor body, I'm considering if purchasing the 35mm is a better option.This is a great lens and I do recommend it. The downside is the same as everyone else has noted so I won't rehash it, the construction is poor. I'd rather pay more for this lens with better construction and even though the Canon f/1.4 is said to have better construction reviews say it has poor auto focus.What I loved:Dreamy images and great bokeh wide openGreat opticsLightweightEasy to useGreat for low light shootingI had no auto focus issuesWhat I hated(and yes I hated this):It broke after a year. I take great care of my gear and this is the only thing that randomly broke. Wasn't dropped--nothing! Just broke.The lens separated from the mount and I've read reviews where others have had this same problem.Would I buy another? Yes. Some reviews report getting longer use out of their lens, maybe there are a few better constructed copies somewhere out there in Canon land.Do I recommend it? Yes. Try it and you'll fall in love with the optics and possibly primes, I did. It's a sweet lens, just be aware that the construction is poor.

So I decided to buy the nifty fifty and use it while I save up for other lenses.If this is going to be your only lens, yes, you will complain a lot. However, eventually you'll learn to appreciate it's awesomeness. This lens is perfect for portrait on a crop. It is also a very handy lens when shooting indoors because of it's 1.8 aperture.Overall, I recommend this lens if you don't have the money to buy a good zoom lens such as the 24-70L or 24-105L or even the 17-55 f/2.8, and don't want to spend money on the kit lenses because you know you'll hate them.PS: You'll hate them even more when you find out how awesome this lens are when they are wide open (f/1.8).""

I haven't had the issues some of the people have had, but like I say, I haven't made it my primary lens.  It is a good lens for the money.  If you get a lemon, I am sorry.  I do not believe I have.  While I do not intend to use it for every single shot, it is nice to be able to just get a little lazy and not want to have to think too hard.""
"20110701","3.0","The price shows through with the quality","Initially, when pulling this lens out of the box, I thought this was one of the best deals I could have found. $100 for a prime 50mm f/1.8 lens sounded like a deal. I didn't have any fast lenses in my pack and thought I'd try out 50mm with my 60D to see how I liked it before I pulled the trigger on a more expensive 50mm lens. This lens has beautiful bokeh at f/1.8 and shoots moderately well in low light. Initially, when looking at the snapshots on the camera's LCD the images looked FANTASTIC. After pulling them onto my PC for editing I realized that the lens has a great deal of trouble with white balance and chromatic abberation. On one image of a fence shot at an angle, I was able to see that green and magenta halos appeared above and below black objects on white backgrounds, which explained the lack of sharpness. Many of the darks look crushed and the image never looks sharp, regardless of the shutter, ISO, and aperture settings. When using both AF/MF I wasn't able to get anything sharp enough to be viewed at high resolution, even when using a well lit scene, fast shutter times and a tripod because of this lens. The same scenes shot on my 18-85mm lens looked significantly clearer and much more accurate when shooting the same lighting conditions. This lens is also unable to focus on anything beyond just a few dozen meters. This would be the first 50mm lens I've played with that DIDN'T focus to infinity. The focal plane maxes out at about 20 meters. In Canon's defense, I'm pretty sure I got a dud, which is a bit frustrating on a $100 purchase, even if it is the cheapest lens out there it should be able to pass quality control.Because of the price, it's not worth it to ship this lens back or sell it. I'll keep it for less important shots. Unfortunately it's useless as a portrait lens because the colors on the face are wildly inaccurate and faces look unnaturally saturated in color. Next time I'll avoid buying an inexpensive lens. Reading the reviews I had assumed the lens was fine, but apparently there are some manufacturing issues with the glass components themselves, not just the casing.""

"20110622","5.0","Great lens for APS-C!","If you happen to have an APS-C Sensored Camera read this.It doesn't give you the perception of natural human view, on that crop factor it comes to 80mm, so here you have a perfect glass for macro, portrait, low light, super fast lens (on the shutter not the AF) for your cropped sensor.Pros:Light weighted1.8 gives a great speed, low light control and very shallow depth of field.the sweetspot starts at 2.8 so it's still really fast and sharp.Disguise for the non geeky robber as it doesn't look expensive.PortabilityCons:Plastic construction (although strong plastic)Slow AF (gets lost following subjects)Note: I almost never take it off from the t2i, it feels so nice and also takes great pictures, so i prefer it over my 70-200mm 2.8 Tamron for indoors (makes the battle) and way over the 18-55mm kit lens (that doesn't even compete with this one).""
"20110621","4.0","A good little lens, but...","This lens is probably about what you'd expect for the money. Its the cheapest of all SLR lenses that I have seen. I use it primarily for DSLR film making and it does exactly what I wanted it to (which is expand my low light capability)and it also provides great shallow depth of field. As some others have pointed out it feels pretty cheaply built. The manual focus feels really rough, especially near the stops. It also tends to have issues auto-focusing at times but not too bad.I use it on a Canon T2i, which like the T3i and the 7D uses the ASP-C sensor. That sensor has an unfortunate 1.6 magnification factor which makes the lens effectively an 80mm. Okay for most stuff, but tight shots can be a challenge.A couple notes about the lens to help you out:- DON'T use a cheap UV filter unless you want a lot of double reflections. Digital sensors are reflective unlike film. If you use an 'uncoated' UV filter (older film style), reflections will bounce around all over the place in the light barrel, especially since this lens has such a wide aperture. Buy the coated ones that actually say something about being for 'digital' SLR's. Expect to spend $50-ish, but its worth it. My $15 one shows 2 windows when looking at 1.- DON'T buy the 52mm filters! If you're buying this lens, chances are you already have some 58mm filters, buy the 52mm - 58mm step-up filter adapter. That will allow you to use your filters on more than one lens. I bought one on Amazon for $4.- A soft rubber lens hood is a nice addition too.  $7 here on Amazon!Bottom line, its a $125 lens, If you want more light gathering or better depth of field control, buy it. It works well for the money.""
"20110621","5.0","Great lens but you get what you pay for...","This is everything you want from a $100 prime lens.  I have had it for a few months now and it has gotten me through quite a few situations, until recently.  Overnight, never being touched, the focus ring now 'clicks' twice throughout the focal range.  These aren't hard soft-sand-in-the-works type of clicks but stiff and loud my-innards-are-coming-loose type of clicks.  I have read reviews about people having this lens literally fall apart in their hands and I think mine is on it's way out.  In hindsight, I would've taken everyone's advice to spring for the more expensive 1.4 50mm by Canon because now I have to go buy it anyway.  Through it all, I am happy to've owned this lens.

"20110621","3.0","Good image quality, but  loud and slow autofocus makes it impossible to shoot people in natural poses.","I bought this lens, because I wanted a wide open lens to shoot even in darker environments without using a flash. Since this is not my primary interest of photography I decided for an affordable lens, where this lens comes into play. Consistent with other reviews, my first impression of the lens was that it is entirely build from plastic, giving it a somehow cheap look. However, I keep my lenses in a padded bag and never had any problems with it. The good thing about the plastic is, that the lens is very light, which makes carrying the camera convenient, especially if you're not going out for shooting but bring your camera along when meeting with friends or just go for a walk.The picture quality is great. Clean and crisp images and with f/1.8 it makes spot-on pictures in dark places.The big downside of this lens is the autofocus. It's slow and really loud. So if you want to take pictures of people and catch them in natural poses, don't use this lens. By the time you hit the autofocus button the lens makes quite some noise while focusing, your model turns around, stares into the camera and you get this weird 'what's happening over there'-face in all of your pictures. I ended up using manual focus for this type of pictures.In a verdict, the lens is great for stills, but I bought it for shooting people in natural poses and for this it's pretty unsuitable.""

I love that I spent so little for a 1.8 max aperature lens! It's not a miracle lens, but it does do pretty well, especially for the tiny price point. The fixed focal length takes a bit of getting used to, and in some cases it almost seems like you have to stand back too far away from small objects to get a good shot. However, with portrait photography, this lens is awesome! Very beautiful softly blurred backgrounds  with sharply focused subjects. I love it. With a little anchoring to provide stability, this lens grabs beautiful shots. I remember reading reviews that boasted tack-sharp focuses at smaller aperatures more so than most kit lenses. I haven't quite found this out, yet, as I have mostly only gone to about 4/f-stop. What can I say? I bought this seeking a wide aperature, and that's what I use the most.

"20110609","4.0","Awesome glass, ultra-fragile lens","Update 6/19/11: After much research for a replacement - even willing to pay almost $300 more for the 50mm 1.4, I am opting to get another 1.8. A few of the not-so-positive reviews for the 1.4 seem to suggest that it may have own its issue. My decision is mainly influenced by consistent mention of the optical quality of the 1.8 being very close to the much more expensive 1.4 or 1.2s. So, since I am more of a casual photography, I will get another one of these and try to handle it like an egg. Also, +1 star, since the value is just too hard to ignore.I purchased this lens in Dec. 2010 and used it for some Christmas holiday shots - the picture quality was consistently awesome. I have used it once since then and it has been parked in my camera bag. I was completely shocked recently to notice the inner lens core loose from its outer shell and some part rattling as I shook it - as if the lens was disengaged or detached from its motor assembly. The lens has never been dropped. The only possible means of damage could have been that the lens had made contact with a lower lens in my 2-compartment camera bag. If so, the contact would have been very light since my bag has barely moved in months. Short of this scenario, the lens simply broke on its own - which I just cannot believe. Nonetheless, the lens construction and its plastic components (maybe interior parts as well) seem fragile and cheap. Too bad for such awesome glass. I have been contemplating a replacement for the past week and just can't convince myself that a same-lens replacement is wise. I may be opting for a better-built replacement instead - unfortunately, much more expensive.My advise: If you seek a lens with excellent optics and are willing to accept its pronounced fragility, then go for it - highly recommended. On the other hand, if you opt for minimally-reasonable durability, pass and look past its cheap price.""

I use my canon t2i for video mainly but wanted the option to do portraits.  i went into a local camera store and tested the lens out on my camera, turned out pretty good.  i wasnt disappointed after paying $140 for this lens, i mean really, what else can you ask for after paying that little?  if you are just starting out with photography, u really have to come to appreciate different lenses and apertures, which is really where the money is.  be warned, with the aperture wide open it will be hard to focus if you are not paying attention.  in the sunlight, it will be beneficial to have a zfinder or something to block out the sun so you can make sure that u r in focus.  yes, the lens has a plastic mount, and chances are, if you drop it, u will break it, but better the lens than your camera breaking.  pictures come out really sharp compared to the kit lens of course, aside from the build quality, i would pick this one over the 1.4 50mm which is 250 dollars more, but you get what you pay for.  there is no IS so depending on the shutter speed, u might have to break out the tripod on some shots.this thing is great in low light and i used the light from my cell phone to test and it was bright.  if you are still reading this and havent decided to buy the lens, just go ahead and do it you cheapskate.  viva la revolucion!!!""
"20110604","5.0","Great lens and even better price","I purchased this lens about 3 weeks ago and I am very pleased.  I wanted a good lens for taking portraits of my son and this one does the job and does it well.  It takes very good photos that are crisp, clear and very sharp.  I could not be happier with the lens especially for the price.  I have already taken literally thousands of photos with this lens and the more photos I take the better my photos get.  You could spend far more on a lens and not get one that takes this good of photos.  I am truly amazed at the quality of the photos it takes for such a low price.Although the lens is light and plastic it still seems relatively sturdy.  ( For the price. )  I'm sure it vouldnt stand up to much abuse but why would you want to abuse your lenses any way.  As long as you take care of it then it should last for a long time.I have seen reviews where people have said they cant get this lens off their camera once they put it on and I have had no such problem.  I put this lens on and take it off to put it in my bag or change lenses at least 5 or 6 times a day and it goes on and comes off with ease each and every time.  So that is not an issue in my opinion.I have also seen reviews saying that the manual focus ring is almost impossible to use but I have had no problems whatsoever using the manual focus on my lens.  Granted the auto focus is not USM but it is still a descent auto focus and no where near as loud as some say.Bottom line though is that this lens takes great photos and you cant beat the price.  Especially for a lens that takes such great photos.  I wish the bokeh was better but the lenses bokeh is still good and the lens takes great photos time after time.  If all you have is the kit lens and your looking for a new lens then this is a good one to start with.  The photo qulity is far better than the kit lens and a lot of other lenses as well.  You will be blown away with the quality difference between this lens and the kit lens and be very pleased.  In my opinion it is money well spent and I am very glad I got this lens.  If you dont have a lot of money to spend but want to take your photography to the next level then this is the perfect lens to get and one that will help to unleash the power of your dslr camera.""
"20110602","3.0","Bang for the buck but be aware of bad copies from Canon USA!","I have got a bad copy. It's a refurbished one from Canon USA as I planned to have 85mm 1.8. When it worked, it's easy to use and the quality of picture was satisfactory. 50mm and 60D would work together very well. It's more versatile than 85mm because of 1.6 crop factor. However, with this copy, after about 10 test shots, I got the error message. After it's taken off and put back, it worked again. Then, only after a few more shots, the problem came back again. This happened with my Canon 60D camera. So I had to return it within 3 days, but it's a little pain to deal with Canon USA, and I had to pay 2 shipments (both delivery and return) even for this defective lens. This bad experience has cost me $25+, that's a lot of money for a cheap lens like this. Because of 50mm's versatility for crop bodies, later I will not get 85mm 1.8 but 50mm 1.4 which has better construction quality and USM, and I'll stick with Amazon from now on.""

This lens is great for the price though, it offers great picture quality and sharp pictures time after time. The construction is one of the only massive drawbacks on this camera.. It is made of cheap plastics that, if you're not careful, will break. If you can be gentle then I would say go for it. If not, then maybe you should save up a few extra hundred and spring for the 50mm 1.4 or even the 1.2 if you really have patience..

"20110524","1.0","I should have listened to the warnings","Wowed by the glowing comments, encouraged by the low price, and undeterred by the few people who warned of the cheap plastic construction, I bought it and immediately placed it on my camera. I loved it. It took great photos of my kids. Artistic shots, wonderful.I took it on a once in a lifetime vacation. I dropped it from a coffee table onto a carpeted floor. The lens immediately fell apart. The front section came out, leaving a tiny plastic piece inside. I blamed myself for putting it in a precarious position even though I thought 'that wasn't that hard of a fall'. I mourned the loss but the balm on the situation was that it was only $100 loss and I could replace the lens with one that I had actually been wanting to buy but couldn't justify quite yet. What a perfect opportunity. I walked into a camera shop in Vancouver and asked for the lens I wanted to try out on my camera. Got the lens, went to take this lens off. Wouldn't come off. Camera shop said to take it to a repair center and have them take the lens apart while on the camera so that the body is not damaged. Bummer. No photos on my trip to Alaska.Came home and read reviews again. Then I remembered the 1 star reviews of this happening. So, it could have been an issue before the drop even. The drop caused the thing to fall apart but who knows if I could have even been able to take the lens off after I first put it on. I didn't even try for the months I had the lens before this happened. I read of some people not being able to take it off the very first day they put it on. I read of others saying the front flew off the first time they just tried to take a photo. Each of these poor people said Canon wouldn't help.I researched how to fix this situation - since my lens is unusable. I decided to just pry it off. Thankfully, the cheap plastic on the lens bent and the body seems ok although I haven't tested it on another lens.Listen, the cheap plastic construction is not just something to live with to treat as a disposable lens. It could seriously damage your body. I am only going with metal now. The cost of possibly damaging the body and losing a precious photo opportunity on a big trip was not worth the money I 'saved' buying this cheap lens. Too bad as it took gorgeous photos. Just too much of a risk though.""

My only complaints (which are minor) will be the noise from the motor (which is not big deal from me at all), slow auto focus, and the build (have to be careful with it).""
"20110520","5.0","SHARP !!!","Lets you take Tack Sharp images at f/2.8 and smaller. For ~$125 you will get the sharpest possible photos from your Canon dSLR. Colors are very faithful. Contrast especially in the details like foliage or skin texture is superb. There is virtually no distortion and no lateral chromatic aberration (fringing).Auto focusing is fast & accurate but noisy. Manual focus is crude at best, I almost never use it.Beautiful background blur at f/1.8. I don't care much about 'bokeh' quality, you can hardly ever see this at smaller photo sizes. For those that care - you can see a hexagonal bokeh pattern in the background in your viewfinder. The sharpness is very sensitive to larger apertures, I'd rate it as follows,1.8 - Very Soft - creates halos on your subject, nice for portraits and some B&W shots - awful for landscapes.2.5 - Somewhat soft / Acceptably sharp.2.8 - Very sharp4.0 - 8.0 Sharpest - sharper than anything i've ever used as a photo enthusiast.11 - Very sharp16 - softerFeels like a plastic toy - I would never lift the camera by this lens. However, I treat this lens with the utmost respect as it produces the best photos.Canon - please make us a version with IS.""
"20110518","4.0","Ground your wallet in realism.","I was recently asked to photograph a wedding of a friend and I don't own any 'short' lenses.  I didn't feel like shlepping my 300L around on a monopod the entire time so it was time to go wider.  Each purchase I have ever made towards my photography gear collection has been an investment, something I expect to have a monetary return on.  Seeing as I'm not going use the lens often I opted for a cheap, but still reliable lens.  I've never really paid attention to the shorter focal length lens market because I have no use for them normally (I do fashion photography).  This lens, however, caught my eye and didn't let go.The only cons I could find about the lens were the construction, a 'plasticy feel' (is that a real word?) is the most common complaint.  For functionality the autofocus was the largest downside.  Both of these are true, however, as my grandfather always said- you get what you pay for.  Chances are if you are even looking at this lens you are either in the same boat as me, or one very similar (budget, budget, budget!).Taking those things into consideration I have become a big fan of this lens.  What is my reasoning you ask?  Let me break it down for you:1) If you purchase a lens for under $150 you cannot put your expectations too high- it's like taking someone on a first date to a fast food restaurant and expecting to get married the next day.  Does not happen, but if it does it's time to rethink your choice.  But I digress.2) The autofocus is mediocre.  Again, see the price tag for the best possible explanation.  What solution do I provide?  Shoot in manual!  A shocking revelation, I know.All in all I am very pleased with my purchase- it's a bargain for the glass and it will be a handy lens to keep in my bag just in case.""
"20110517","3.0","Takes wonderful pictures, but is the most fragile lens on the market","I have not yet met anyone who uses this lens that have not broken one, I am one of the many. Canon must have hired engineers to create a lens that is guaranteed to break. This thing is like a house of cards, beware of breathing on it, with fear and trembling (well, try not to tremble) use manual focus or put on a lens cap, or allow the camera to hang around your neck. it must be plastic the width of a strand of hair that holds this thing together. So yeah, just treat it like a newborn baby, never one careless moment, or else its head will fall out and you'll be out a $125. Some reviews mentioned the front part fell out while taking pictures, right after buying it, they did not even bump it. Of course Canon would not honor the warranty. Anything that happens will be YOUR fault, even if you did not abuse it. But yeah, with that aside, look at me, I got another one. It takes wonderful photos, I think it focuses faster then the more expensive 50mm 1.4, that I borrowed from a friend.""

I purchased this lens with my aperature wide open, so to speak, especially concerning the 1 write-ups that revealed some real bad experiences.  I chose to buy the lens anyway and have been thrilled with the photos I have taken.  I know I must be careful with it as it certainly isn't built like a tank as my Mark III is, but it is a wonderful lens for the price, actually surprised at the quality of pictures for basically a 100 bucks.

Hopefully canon can do something for me with this as im trying to send it off to them, but since its past the 90 day mark I'm not holding my breath.

Yes, it's not going to beat Canon's best lenses, but the person buying this lens isn't the one who wants to spend $1000+ on a lens right now. It's great for just starting out (we bought it two months after getting my first DSLR), and I tell my friends that if they want to save money, to buy this lens instead of buying their camera with a kit lens. The photos are beautiful and sharp. It's very popular now to have blurry backgrounds in photos, and I tell my friends that this is an affordable lens that they can do that with. I'll admit that the light bokeh comes out in pentagrams sometimes and is not as smooth, but the overall quality of performance of this lens coupled with it's practicality still makes it deserving of 5 stars in my opinion. If you are willing to spend a little extra and get the Canon 50 1.4, then I would go for it (I kind of wish I had). If not, I still think you'll be very happy with this lens. I have the 24-70 f2.8 (which I use depending on the shooting situation) that sells for $1000+, and I still love this prime. A large percentage of my photos so far have been taken with it, and it's light and easy to carry around. I might upgrade it someday to the 1.2 many years in the distant future, but that doesn't mean I don't love this lens. I should mention, however, that most of my photos are of people (mainly children), things at home, and the other goings on of family life, and the friends I recommend it to will be mostly photographing the same subjects.""

Although I read the reviews and understood that the lens had questionable build quality, I concluded that for the price and given the Canon name, it would be ok for a teenager.  Sadly, when I received it I was surprised to find it was almost entirely plastic... almost toy-like.  After about 90 days, the lens became jammed on the camera and could not be removed.  I have owned 4 Canon DSLR's and 10 EOS lenses and none have ever jammed in the camera mount like this.  Ultimately, the plastic casing around the lens fell apart while we attempted to remove the lens.  Very disappointing.  I am sending it back, but I really don't want it replaced because the way it is built it will not hold up under any sort of field use.  A minor bump will damage the casing around the lens.""
"20110426","5.0","Simply Awesome","The question here isn't whether you should consider buying this lens, the question is why you don't already own one. The Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 II is simply an amazing lens to use. The optics are super sharp and the wide 1.8 aperture will open up a whole new world of imagination for the creative photographer. It is really wonderful in low light situations and for all of you using a 1.6 crop size sensor, the 50 f.1.8 will be more like an 80 mm medium telephoto. Many reviews on this site complain about the build quality, but I am here to tell you that is not as big an issue as it might seem. If you are familiar with the Canon 18-55 mm kit lens, you will appreciate an upgrade in build quality with the EF 50. The focusing is smooth and the auto focus motor (although a little loud) is fairly fast and accurate. Creamy bokeh, tack sharp crispness and awesome, rich colors await you. Whether you are a beginner or an intermediate photographer, you won't find a better prime lens in this price range. Dollar for dollar, the 50 mm f/1.8 II is a steal. Don't think about it... Don't ask your spouse... just buy one.""

As a new DSLR user I have not mastered taking low light portrait pictures using this lens. Will update when I do that.3. When I take pictures of both my wife and kid and if one of them is like 6 to 10 inches behind, they will appear blurred. This is not a defect. I am writing what I experience as a new user.4.

"20110413","4.0","Cheap wide aperture lens","The product is OK, but the body is all plastic. First I use this lens with a subframe camera (the rebel family) in which case you have to remember this lens will be equivalent to an 80mm (so a narrower angle or in other words: more telephoto). That said the lens is excellent to take pictures in dark conditions: churches, museums, places where the flash is not permited or simply because like me, you hate flash! now when taking pictures with the lens wide open under those conditions if you use auto white balace your pictures turn out with a red hue. To avoid that you need to use one of the camera creative modes, take a picture of a white wall, and use it as a reference for the custom white balance. Or even better, get an expo disk for that task, it will make your life much easier and save you a lot of photoshop time. Remember this lens has no IS so it is a fast lens but it has limits. A cheap monopod and a ball head might be a good companion. I hope this makes sense and covers some of the main uses of this lens.""
"20110410","5.0","Bokeh Bokeh Bokeh","This is the lens to experiment with. With f/1.8, you can make pretty nice effects here. However, the bokeh(out of focus area) is a bit rough at apertures other than f/1.8. This is due to the five blade apertures used in the lens. This is a very good entry portrait lens on APS-C camera with an effective focal length of 80mm.""
"20110410","5.0","Excellent value","I've used this lens for about two months now and, so far, I love it.  I use it on my crop-sensor Canon 7D which makes the lens equivalent to an 80mm.My copy of this lens is really sharp at f/2.8 - 4.0 which has allowed me to take very nice portraits with smooth bokeh.  AF is a little loud,  but with my 7D, fast and accurate.It has no outer threads for a lens hood.  I bought a 3rd party lens hood which screws onto the inner filter threads.I've read some other reviews where this lens can be easily broken by over tightening the filters or lens hoods.It is VERY lightweight. It appears to have same quality in construction as do the Canon kit lenses so be careful not to drop it.This lens is an excellent value at about $100.""
"20110410","5.0","Great, Great lens","This lens is really a keeper and Awesome.  I purchased this for night time videography and it has exceeded my expectations.  I not only use it for night time but i use it for most of my photography because of the great depth of field and it takes really nice portraits.  It is made of light weight plastic which does feel cheap, but who cares when you see the quality you put out.  just dont drop the thing.  Another thing you must really watch your depth of field so you wont have blurred shots.  Totally worth more then twice the asking price.""

"20110401","4.0","Great Lens for $100","I use this lens extensively on my Canon 60D and love everything about it. For only $100, I get sharp photos, great colors, fast auto-focus, amazing performance in low-light, and wonderful depth of field. It's my go-to-lens for portraits. The two things that I don't like about it is:1) it's made of plastic, so it feels like a toy, but it's not poor quality. Treat it with care as you would any other lens and you will be fine.2) it is a bit noisy when focusing, but it's fast and at $100, I can't complain.I was torn between this lens and the 50mm 1.4, but ultimately it came down to cost and I do not regret my purchase whatsoever. If I should drop and break it then, well, I've only spent $100. No big deal. Many folks have mentioned that this lens produces poor image quality, but I just don't agree with them. If you truly KNOW how to use your camera and can adjust for different lighting situations then this little thing will create photos that rival an L lens. Remember, it's about skill, not equipment.Also, please keep in mind that if you don't have a full-frame camera, you'll need to adjust for crop factor. One reviewer mentioned that he bought this lens and was disappointed because he didn't have enough room in his house to get a wider shot. This of course is a user problem, not a lens issue. On my Canon 60D, this 50mm lens is actually an 80mm lens because of the 1.6x crop factor.I hope you enjoy this lens as much as I do!""

"20110326","1.0","Love... Like... HATE.","So I ordered and attached this f/1.8 50mm lens to my Rebel T1i after reading all the awesome reviews about it.  Here is what I thought.1) It was awesome in low light setting.2) Image quality is GREAT... when focused.3) I started to notice that the auto focus was missing about every 2-3 shots.4) I went to swap another lens on the camera and the 50mm f/1.8 II would not come off.  It turned about 1/4' and would simply stop.  I looked this problem up online and found that I am not alone.  Shady construction of this lens is to blame.  I did nothing wrong.  It simply broke because it's built cheap.The good news is that I called Canon customer support and they are going to fix it (within warranty) and send it back.  I won't ever put this lens back on my camera.  Spend the $$ and get the f/1.4 50mm.  This one is garbage.""

Although, many experienced photographers have told me the 1.4 is overrated. 1.2 is Great for HD video, but not in most recreational photographers' budgets.This is one of those things that makes you thinks, 'Oh yeah, this is why I bought a Canon.'

The only prime I would recommend over this as a first lens might be the 30mm.For video it is great, so long as you use a tripod.  It has no image stabilization so handheld shots are unusable unless you are an unusually steady hand.  I have not tried it with a rig yet, but its possible you can get suitable footage that was as well.The image quality is amazing at this price point.  I couldn't find a cheaper lens to get started with that had the same quality image.""

"20110321","5.0","Good buy","I bought my first DSLR (Canon Rebel T2i) in November 2010.  This is the first lens (outside of the kit lenses) I've purchased for my camera and I'm pleased.It took me a while to get used to the fixed focal length - you have to move your body because the lens won't move.  I find that I need to stand further away from people than normal to compose a portrait, but the image quality is worth it.I mainly purchased this lens for food photography and I'm very happy with the results.  It performs well in natural light and low light, so it's great for food on my table at home or in a restaurant.  It also creates that 'out of focus backround' (bokeh) very well.I'm still learning about DSLR photography, but between reading books and purchasing this lens, my photos are much improved. You can't beat the price.  I recommend this lens if you're just starting out and you want to have some versatility in your camera bag.""

After purchasing this lens, my photos are a lot better immediately. and its great value for money.""

"20110320","5.0","Wow! So glad I bought this lens.","Amazing. I bought this after reading about 3 million user reviews, many of which I must admit went a bit over my head (enthusiastic amateur, on my best day). Was considering the f/1.4 and went with this one for the price. LOVE THIS LENS! My husband and I own a Canon T2i and have been thrilled with the photos we're getting. We've owned it for about 3 weeks, which means we've taken approximately 4,000 pictures of our dachshund. Poor dog.Upon seeing some of the photos, my sister and mom immediately ordered their f/1.8 lens and are thrilled with the results (they own a Canon T1i and Rebel XT). The bokeh is beautiful, and the focus is incredibly crisp. It's also been a pretty good walk-around lens, which I think will improve the more I play with it (user error, no fault of the lens).If I had to pick only one lens to use, this would be it. The build is solid, even for all the plastic. So very happy to have purchased one. Get one! You'll love it!""

Recommend putting a lens filter for protection and keep it in your bag for great portrait work. Many have spoken loud and clear how great a buy this lens is. I don't think I'll ever sell mine and that's how valuable it is to me. Set it at 1.8 for best results 100 ISO for portrait and blurred out backgrounds.""
"20110317","4.0","Great lens for simple portrait shots","This is the standard low cost lens for taking macro / portrait pictures.  I like to take photos but I'm not an expert.  It takes pretty good quality portraits under natural light.  Since it's not a zoom lens, your feet will have to do the moving to frame the pictures.  I only used it a few times, so I can't comment on the durability.  But it looks decent solid enough.""

You cannot ask for a better combination of performance and cost, and you will not find one anywhere else down the line.

"20110316","5.0","good starter lens for the money","i got this lens because everyone said a 50mm lens was an essential one to have in your bag. it was super cheap, had a really fast fstop and had great picture quality. i was a little nervous about the quality of build and its just as cheap as it looks. however the pictures come out amazing and i love this lens. it is tough to focus because the ring is in the front and the autofocus is loud and slow, also its tough to hook a hood up to or a filter because it screws inside instead of on the outside like normal lenses. so if you have the coin buy up but if you are looking for a great lens for cheap this is it, but treat it like a lady or it's gonna be in pieces.""
"20110315","5.0","Better than I was expecting!","Bought this lens expecting to take portraits and I've taken some of my best pictures with it!

I disagree. The plastic is of high quallity, when you touch it, you just immediately understand it's no toy - it's hard, solid; It feels really good.

"20120414","5.0","Incredible depth of field","This is the first fast lens I've had. It's better for lower light and the depth of field is amazing. But it is a cheap lens. You can feel it... and hear it. When the autofocus is working it makes a lot of noise. And the manual focus sounds like there are a couple bearings missing. Having worked with zoom lenses for so long I was wary of how useful a prime lens this short could be. But it works well in a lot of applications. As I shoot with a Canon Digital Rebel, it actually works as somewhere around 75mm. Not bad for portraits. And I've gotten some nice landscapes from it.If you need a really fast lens for really low dollars, this is a good deal. If you can buy a better lens later, this one keeps its resale value pretty well, so you should be able to get most of your money back on it.Oh, yeah. Bokeh. Bokeh. Bokeh. That is one fad term that has worn itself out in the reviews for this lens. Because of the extremely shallow depth of field with this lens, you can get some great OUT OF FOCUS BACKGROUNDS (aka bokeh).""

"20110307","5.0","I can dig it","This lens is pretty awesome! Especially for the low price it's being sold for. I missed the UPS guy (as usual) and had to go to the UPS to pick it up. Immediately upon recieving the lens I threw that bad boy on my Canon T2i and snapped a couple of test shots. Initially I wasn't too amazed by the pictures but that's only because I was using the map lights in my car for the only lighting source. I got home an snapped a couple shots of my GF and still wasn't that amazed. The next morning I grabbed my camera and started taking pics of my other favorite subject, my dog Cypress. The camera works great with natural sunlight. The lens is super fast and sharp for it's price. If you haven't gotten into primes yet then I think this would be a great start.The lens is really short as it is a 50mm, but it makes the camera much lighter when transporting it. It is made of plastic and feels a little cheap to the touch but you will quickly forget that once you see the pictures this lens produces. The lens does have AF/MF but I would suggest using the MF when shooting video because the AF is much louder than the kit lens.I am not a pro, hence the lack of technical mumbo jumbo, but what I can tell you is that I am very pleased with my first lens purchase and look forward to buying another prime. It is a nice step up in picture quality from having the kit lens. Once you use this lens you will see the difference and will probably end up selling the kit lens like I did to put toward another lens. Thanks for reading.""
"20110306","4.0","If you're on the fence about this one...","I just received the Canon EF50mm f/1.8II and I'm already putting this thing through its paces.  First, let me address the build quality.  Yes, it is a plastic body, but no it isn't as poor as some reviewers will make it seem, in fact I think it feels pretty solid for what it is.  Second, many have commented on the audible noise factor of the lens.  Again, not as bad as I was lead to believe in other reviews.  The AF is actually pretty quick and precise.  Now, the most important aspect, picture quality.  WOW!  Dial this thing to f/1.8, and the sharpness and clarity of the subject is beautiful, great bokeh as well!  I'm still a novice to photography, so the price point of this lens was very appealing.  This is my first fixed lens, and I am loving it!  At this point, I may not be able to analyze all the intricate specifications of this lens, but I have a pretty good eye, and what this thing is producing out of the box is pure inspiration!  I'm humble enough to know that, at this point, I don't need to spend three time as much on the f/1.4, because this lens will definitely hold over a novice in training.  If it breaks in a few years, well then, hopefully, I'll be better skilled and ready to move up to the 'higher quality' lens, but for now, for us novices, this is such a great purchase.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this lens.  I've seen this thing list for $99.00, but at $119.00 I couldn't find a lower price for a new one, and for $20, why take a chance with a used one.  Anyway, I hope to update this review in the future, but for now, my advice is buy this lens before the price goes up again!""

"20110304","3.0","Still loving this lens, but...","Before reading this, let me tell you i'm using a cropped camera, for people having full frames you probably are considering more expensive lens and won't have the same problem I have with this lens.I got this lens for my canon xti, crop factor 1.6, which I now understand makes this lens effectively a 80mm, and it is the great lens for the price you pay, if you have the original kit lens (17-55 without IS on my model) and then get this you, like me, will be initially very excited and well introduced to the photography world...  I found myself thinking this lens would be my one and only prime and the answer to my low light photos, and it is in its way: photos are nice, better exposed, sharper, faster (focusing and shutter speed), I started feeling like a pro, which is the reason I got my DSLR for, right?... but then you look at the pictures and realize things you shoot at have to be 15-20 feet away, and then again indoors shots are almost impossible and cropped because i couldn't walk far enough to get everybody in the picture.I have it for three years now, and I even though I still love my lens for outdoors, I know there are better lens out there(1.4, 1.2), not just faster but better built too, I regret not trying them before buying this, and for indoors I probably would be better with the 28mm 1.8, in these situations I found myself still preferring to carry the kit lens which is the one I always wanted to change! (I did learned how to use it tough and take much better pictures with it now)Bottom line, if you are in a budget and want to improve your photos without a bigger commitment, give this a try, just remember this is an entry level and if you have the possibility to try it before buying it, consider the situations you are going to use it before buying.""
"20110301","5.0","get one, get it now!","Firstly, if you are shooting digital without a full size sensor, this will be very similar to to old 85mm f1.8, as Canon's multiplier is 1.6 so it's going to be like an 80mm in film. Which makes it a nearly perfect portrait lens. But, a small depth of field can make for many interesting photos!I sell cameras for a living. If I show this lens to someone, they buy it. It has an incredible depth of field and all for, I think we sell it for $119.99. If you are planning to do portrais, and you want to blurr out the background, this will do all that at a very fair price!Yes, it isn't a USM so it isn't quiet, but define your terms. It isn't like a cement mixer. Though I grant mine is about 8 years old and may need to be replaced as it does sound like it's straining. Which brings me to construction, it has a plastic mount and this is why is costs under $200. If you take reasonable care it will last you many years. As I say mime is like 8 years old and it is just straining a bit. It still works.You want to take that perfect shot of a dandelion ready to blow in a breeze wih an incredible blue sky? You wil need this an a polaeizing filter. Oh, speaking of filters. Get yourself a UV filter. It really is just going to MAYBE save your lens if you drop if and it lands on the end. It MAY protect it from cracking the barrel. Think $20 and maybe not having to repair (repar a $120 lens???) or replace it. Also, you are less likely to scrath teh lens with a uv on it.""

"20110228","4.0","Pleased with ease of use (extreme SLR novice).","I purchased this lens just cause and I must admit the pictures I've taken with it so far have not disappointed me. I prefer to use the lens in Manual Focus...it seems like the little motor is working so hard and I'm not ready to make the jump to the next model so to give it a break and me more experience in learning, this is fine. My only real complaint with this lense, is the material its made from. With all lenses you should be careful, but this one because of its delicateness you have to show a little more caution. Overall I am pleased with my purchase, I would recommend this product and defintely purchase from this retailer again.""
"20110228","5.0","Great lense for the price","Awesome lense, took a little to get shipped but it was well worth the wait. The one issue I noticed was a what looks like a small scratch or black spot inside the lense. I tried cleaning but it's definitely unreachable without taking it apart. The good this is that it does not affect the picture at all. So far I've taken dozens of photos and all come out with the great quality that this lense delivers. A must have. in my opinion.""
"20110227","5.0","My new nightime lens","I spend every moment I can walking the streets of Ciudad Juarez in Mexico, night and day, from dawn until after midnight or more. In the daytime I use a long lens with IS. By night and in low light ambient situations, this is the lens to use, even without IS. I find the clarity unbeatable, as it is a fixed lens, not zoom, and the simplicity very gratefully received for the difficult situations under which I shoot. Just stand, plan my shot, whip it out, snap, done.Love this lens. Those who do not have other issues.I used this lens last night in a coffeehouse poetry reading here in CJ and it worked great, including during the interpretive dance segment. Just really a great lens, and no problem slipping on and off. I need to carry light and do not carry a large photo bag around with me, just a very small over the shoulder bag like young kids forty years younger than me carry, and my set-up is what I will use until getting back to the hotel to change lenses. The pug nose of this lens makes things a joy all around, and the images produced are incredible, beyond belief, very sharp even with the higher ISO, and a lower ISO can be used because of the aperture.Don't take my word for it. Try it out. At this price it's unbeatable, but use it right, for what it was designed for, and you can take all of the candids you want or need.""
"20110227","2.0","Cheaply made","Okay. So I ordered this lens two weeks ago and I'm pretty sure I wore it out. It's plastic and very cheaply made. The lens literally fell apart. I would reccommend spending around $200 more and getting the 1.6 because it is made from metal and not plastic.I must praise the picture quality, though. I was very pleased with the detail that it picked up when the f-stop was low. The pictures were so clear and crisp. I really couldn't believe I got that quality from a $100 lens.In conclusion, this lens is cheap and will fall apart if you're a photographer that uses your camera everyday. But you do get what you pay for, image quality wise. Just note that it's extremely fragile and will break without you dropping, slamming, throwing, etc. I never even bumped mine on anything and it still fell apart.""
"20110227","5.0","Great Lens","What a great lens for the money! If you are searching for an affordable f1.8 portrait lens, then search no more. The images are clean and sharp and the shallow depth of field is amazing and just what I was looking for. The auto focus works fast and I have not had any issues with the lens. True, it's not a telephoto lens which means you have to move your feet. But it sure beats the $1,700 price tag of my f2.8 70-200 lens. Don't get me wrong, I love that lens too and it has it's place during weddings, but this 50mm lens has become my prime portrait lens.""
"20110226","5.0","Awesome lens, awesome price!","Yes, this lens is not as 'well-built' as the others but at $120 what do you expect? If you're the type that throws their equipment around (I don't know why anyone would do that, but in reading some of the reviews it is obvious some do!)then this probably won't last. However, treat it kindly and it will last a long time!  The photographs are AMAZING and the bokeh is wonderful. Get this lens now!  You won't be disappointed!""
"20110226","2.0","Lens Fell Apart","I purchased this lens because of all of the outstanding reviews it had received.  I was thrilled to have a lightweight lens for my Canon 7D as the other lenses I have are quite heavy.  Although it had a plastic casing, so many reviewers felt it produced excellent images.  I was sold and agreed this was good purchase and, indeed, I liked the images produced with this lens.However, now I have a different perspective about the lens.  In the middle of taking a photo about a month after purchase, the front of the lens literally fell to the ground.  I could not believe it came apart.  This also damaged my Tiffen UV Protector filter.  I have contacted the seller and will await the response before commenting about customer service.  Perhaps I just received a defective lens and all will be remedied with a replacement.  None the less, I wanted to post this review as a indication that perhaps you get what you pay for!""

"20110223","5.0","The "Go To" lens","This lens should be in every photogs bag.  It's my Go To lens and works for portraits and low light.  Not too big of an investment for a great product.""
"20110222","4.0","Seeing Clearly Now","This lens produces a crystal clear image and yet has a very shallow Depth of field at F 1.8. The lens has many creative possibilites in isolating your subject from the background. Not really a portrait lens, but would work well with small groups or outdoor people shots. Obviously fast lens has a real benefit in doors under low light conditions. The lens has a 52mm thread size, which in my case was very valuable since I have quite a few filters from an older film camera. As other reviewers have noted, this is not a metal lens, but unless you are unusually rough with your camera the lens should last for several years. The lens is also easy on the budget, since the heavier metal lens from canon costs about $380. It is unusual to see so many people a speciality item and be happy with it, so the lens has been field tested by consumers under a wide variety of circumstances. I would definately recomend this lens to a potential buyer.""

"20110219","5.0","I never went back to my 18-55...","I bought this lens sometime in Fall '10 (a couple months ago) and I NEVER went back to my 18-55 kit lens.First of all, the wide open aperture of f/1.8 is PHENOMENAL. It is also VERY SHARP when stopped down, I usually go down to f/4 for general sharpness, f/8, and f/11 for landscapes. It is also EXCELLENT in low light situations, not having image stabilization is not an issue for me either, I have still been able to take amazing photos at night without IS.I owned an XSi (just upgraded to a 40D) and this lens made taking photos immensely more fun, and I learned a lot from it. Since it's a prime, you can't zoom, so it really makes you think about your shots.It is awesome as a portrait lens, since on a 1.6 cropped body it is equivalent to an 80mm (Canon's 85mm f/1.8 is known as one of the best portrait lenses).I use it for everything besides portraits, the only issue I ever faced was when I was indoors in a tight space, I did not have enough room to take a family photo, the ONLY time I resorted to using my 18-55.Overall though, everyone complains about the build quality. It IS a plastic mount, with a plastic body all around, and you don't need a dedicated manual focus ring since the one on it works fine, so I don't see any reason for complaints.I paid around $100 for this from here (Amazon) back then, and I do not know why the price has gone up.I would buy another one if I had the extra money as a spare, and if the price was still lower. Overall, excellent glass for a very low price, if you treat it well, then you shouldn't worry about the build quality. If you own a dslr anyway, you should be treating it well overall.""
"20110219","5.0","Don't let the cheap build scare ya","First off, if you plan on taking very low light night shots close up and don't have a huge budget,  this is the lens for you.  Sure you have to move up to the subject because it's a prime lens(no zoom) but the auto focus is pretty good for a inexpensive lens like this.  Takes great portraits and even scenery.  I'll post some early pictures I took with it.  You be the judge.""

"20110218","4.0","Love this lens!","So i bought this lens for my girlfriend, and she LOVES it. She's an aspiring photographer and needed some new glass and something with a big aperture and low price was just the ticket for an Xmas gift!It does great depth of field shots that just look FANTASTIC, and the clarity you can get on specific light sources (say a christmas tree) is insane! Also I've played with a bit to do some star photo's and the large aperture works so well! I was kind of disappointed though after doing a long exposure shot to see that the light pollution had turned the sky yellow! Also taking a picture of a house across the street with a street light in front of it, I had no problem creating a clear shot where the street look like day!It's so refreshing all the interesting things you can do with the 1.8 aperture that I wasn't used to at all!So the bad.... it's all plastic including the mounting point.... it just doesn't feel like it's built to last. My girlfriend dropped it/knocked it a few times on accident while attached to the body and it still is 100% fine, it just doesn't inspire confidence.The other bad thing (and this may be more her camera which needs updating) is that it has a very hard time autofocusing in low light, also 50mm seems to be a little too much zoom for every day use, and it can be frustrating to move yourself to adjust the frame rather then changing your zoom.But hey! You get what you pay for! And for 118 bucks this thing is FANTASTIC! If you want a fixed focus large aperture lenss and don't want to spend lots of cash there's no better option.""

It simply just quit working.  Manual focus was intact, but auto was gone.  I was so disappointed!!!!!  I am mailing it back for a refund.

"20110214","3.0","Sharp but fragile","This lens worked great for about a year until breaking. To be fair I didn't treat it like a really delicate item, but I wasn't hard on it. I would carry it with my camera in my backpack wrapped in a shirt while travelling.What happened is the inner focusing mechanism just fell out of the camera. It is all plastic except for the lens, so even moderate lateral pressure on the focusing mechanism over time will result in stress fractures in the plastic.This is a great value lens with superb picture quality, but if I had it to do over again I would have bought the more expensive EF 50mm f/1.4.""
"20110214","5.0","Great for my 2 year old","I bought this 50mm Canon lens to supplement the 18-55mm kit lens that came with my T2i. I really bought the dSLR mainly for trying to capture good photos of my toddler indoors without a flash and I thought that the wider aperture of this lens might come in handy. My only regret at this stage is not saving $100 bucks on the kit by buying the body only camera.Initially, I was trying too hard to use the manual settings to get good shots. I spent a lot of time in AE mode playing with the aperture settings but I still seemed to be getting low shutter speeds and blurry shots indoors. I had reached the point where I could get better shots with the kit lens on the same settings thanks to the IS on the lens. And my wife was mad because I spent so much on a camera and it still took blurry shots like the old P&S.Then I decided to give the Sports mode on the camera a try with the 50mm. What a difference! Suddenly I could get bursts of quick shutter high aperture shots with good focus tracking. Granted the ISOs were frequently 3200 but the shots look good enough for album prints, which will be my primary use for most of them. And the kit lens can no longer compete because it is f/5.6 at the same 50mm focal length.I should mention that focus accuracy could seem like a problem with the lens but I think that would be unfair. Indoors in the sports mode, the lens frequently sets at f/1.8 or f/2.0. At those aperture settings the depth of field is very shallow and sometimes the images seem out of focus when in fact the focal point has simply locked on a point other than the desired target. I think that is the price to pay being able to leave the flash off all the time.My advice to anyone new to dSLRs and looking to get indoor action shots of the kids is to buy the body, get this lens and go straight to sports mode. You can learn how to really use the camera when the shots don't matter as much.""

The glass is good the build quality is not but then you don't have to do much to it but put it on the camera body and leave it alone.

"20110213","5.0","Great Lens","I've really enjoyed this lens for the few times I've used it over the last 6 months.  I was great for a low light wedding I shot last year and is what really got me started in wanting to do wedding photography.  Hope everyone enjoys this lens as much as I have.Secondly, I want to address some of the lower reviews by saying this.  This is lens sells for just over a hundred dollars, it isn't intended for professional use and it is clearly an entry level lens for people who are new to DSLR or for people who take photo's recreationally.Keeping that in mind, you should understand that the build quality isn't comparable to the higher end lenses.  You are right, it does have a plastic mount but all lenses similar to this does!  The outside is made of plastic but again all lenses like this are.People need to understand what they are shooting and buy accordingly.  Don't purchase a lens, that you know will be made of plastic and have a plastic mount if you are intending it for heavy use (Semi-Pro or Pro shooters) and then come on here and trash the lens.For the average shooter (who isn't hard on their equipment) this is going to be a must have lens.

"20110125","2.0","First lens with the 5D Mark II","I am a professional photographer and I bought this lens with my first 5D Mark II body. At the time I couldn't continue using the current canon rebel EF-S lenses. This was a cheap option until I could afford a more appropriate all-purpose lens.Optics:The first thing you'll notice is that below f/9 - nothing is sharp except the very center of the frame. The fallout toward the ends of the image is unreal. The chromatic aberration is so bad that in some images I was able to see the color separation like a rainbow!Build:The barrel is light plastic which is not terrible, but if you drop it, it will probably break - even with a filter attached. The autofocus sounds like a robot from an 80's movie and moves as fast. None of these factors are personal deal breakers but important to note. You should expect this from any budget lens.Conclusion:If you are shooting in bright daylight, you will be able to effectively use this lens. For shooting in the field especially, with low-lighting where you need low aperture settings it is completely useless. The images will be unsuitable even for web.In my experience the lens was a total waste of time and money. I am a die-hard canon user and find their lenses to be top quality. I ended up spending $300 on another lens shortly after, just so I could use my camera. Right now the 50mm is sitting around collecting dust. I haven't sold it because I'm afraid it would not even merit the value of the effort of selling.""

"20110123","3.0","I dont get the hype ...","First of all, I know that if you're interested in this lens you'll end up buying it anyway cause it has raving reviews anywhere you look and it's cheap.Anyways, I wanna give my 2c about it because I don't agree with much that I've read here.I'm using it with a brand new Canon T2I that takes amazing pictures with the kit lens (18-55mm). I bought this lens hoping to take some nice portraits and for it's ability to blur nicely the background, since it has a very wide aperture (f 1.8).I can say that at least 70% of my pictures are off focus. I'm using single manual focus point in the t2i (center point) and even tough I always focus on my subject's eyes, their entire face seems WAY off focus in 70% of my shots. This doesn't happen at all with the kit lens. I don't know if I got a defective unit, it doesnt seem to be the case, but that's just the way it is.People say it's not sharp at 1.8 and they are NOT kidding. Its really, really, really soft. For the pictures to be usable I have to use at least 2.8, wider than this you get a very soft picture. And I'm not even a pro, they're really unusable.It does have a nice ability to blur the background, but FORGET about taking any landscapes shots with this glass, because 50mm on a t2i or similar is very 'zoomed in' if you know that I mean ...If you just bought a DSLR and its your first lens after your kit lens, PLEASE keep in mind that this is a FIXED focal lenght lens, wich means it doesnt zoom in or out like your kit lens (wich goes from 18 to 55 mm). AND remember that on cropped bodies like the T2i, T1I, etc, you have to multiply the focal lenght by 1.6, so this actually means you're buying a 80mm mens. In my experience it's VERY hard to take indoor pictures with this lens because it always seem it's 'zommed in' ...If you really wanna know how it behaves, get your kit lens, zoom it to 50mm and pretend you can't zoom out. Try to take pictures with it for a day like that and see if you find your shots usable ...""

"20110119","3.0","It's OK","As an ametuer in the photography I bought this lense to start out and love how it takes indoor and outdoor pictures. However trying it out at night shooting a picture to the moon a notice a spot on the lense and thought it was dust??? however nothing when shooting this showed a blue dot which I have only seen when taking when I shoot to the moon, haven't tried it on the sunrise or sunsents. It don't show up all the time. So I believe it must be a lens flare? Maybe I will have to buy a hood?That's why I gave it three stars which is a lot, but the lense cost me less than $100 so it's OK.""
"20110118","4.0","Good Beginner Lens","The Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 is a good start up lens.  I bought it because I was doing just that, and I wanted a fast lens for some street photography as well as portraits.  On a crop sensor, it makes it equivalent to about an 80mm.  It's not always clear at 1.8, but it's great from f2.0-5.8.  It's plastic and the AF is noisy, and the manual focus ring is almost non-existant, but again, this lens is almost made to be replaceable after some use.  Good to learn on, its the lens that I leave on my camera.""
"20110116","3.0","Read this before you spend the $100","I have had this lens for 1 year now.  I know that $100 is not much to spend on a lens, but I would think twice before buying this lens again.On the positive side, IF the lens focuses properly, you get very sharp amazing images - even at f1.8.  My problem with this lens is that this is a very big IF.I have a Canon XSi camera.  With the lens set to f1.8, there is a very shallow depth of field.  Combine this with the lens' problem of normally front-focusing (i.e. if you focus at an object 30 inches away, it will probably focus at 28' or 29'), and you have an out-of-focus picture.After having this lens for almost a year, and reading that this is a very common problem with this lens, I sent it back to Canon for this problem.  They agreed with me and replaced a large part of the lens assembly.  Since I have received it back, it works slightly better.  I have just finished running some tests on a tripod, and set to 1.8, about 80% of my pictures are out of focus because it focused incorrectly.  At f2.8, this drops to about 20%.So, if you do buy this lens, be prepared that:1.  You might have to send it back to Canon for repairs.2.  Even if it works 'fine' expect limited usability out of it at f1.8.  Plan to shoot at f2.8 or higher.3.  At lower f stops, plan to shoot many pictures to get some that are good.I am not sure if this issues is worse with my model of camera.  I have no reason the believe that my cameras is any better or worse than any of the other Rebel series cameras.  If you have a 7D, or some other much better camera, with a much better focusing mechanism, then perhaps you will have better luck.  But then again, if you are going to spend $1500 on a 7D body, wouldn't you buy a much better built lens?""
"20110116","5.0","Don't let anyone fool you..","This is a great camera lens! I bought it for my girlfriend and she's been takin pictures with it non stop and thanking me all the time for it. The build of the lens seemed pretty sturdy to me and didn't look like at all it would 'suicide itself while taking a picture one day' the picture quality is great, my girlfriend keeps talking about how beautiful the blur is in the background. This lens doesn't zoom in, but it's already so close that you have to back away for most pictures. I wouldn't worry about the possibility of it breaking, because if it does in less than a year, the warranty will give you a new one. If it lasts the whole year and breaks afterwards, then it was worth at least the $100 you spent on it. This lens is a great gift. I'm not a camera person, I don't take pictures, but a beginning photographer will love this. I enjoy all the pictures she takes and everyone comments on them all the time for how beautiful they are.

"20110114","4.0","Excellent Value For Your Money","I bought this lens to go with my new Canon Rebel T1i I purchased in November 2010. This is my first DSLR camera, and I've only been taking pictures with it for a couple months.The lack of image stablization for shots without a flash takes some getting used to if you normally chase your toddler around to catch her with a cute look on her face. I'd stick with the kit lens (18-55mm) for those kind of shots.But for more portrait type shots, this is an excellent lens for the beginning hobbiest. The sharpness in low-light indoor settings without a flash is extraordinary.Some friends of mine asked me to take some portrait shots of their two-week old baby and I was happy to try it out using this lens. Most of the shots turned out great, especially using natural light coming in from the windows. There were a few shots that turned out blurry because the lens lacks image stablization and I must have jerked slightly when the shutter opened.Although I noticed the blurry pictures, my friends were extremely pleased with the shots that turned out well.Some things to be aware of:1. The auto-focus on this lens can be pretty slow, which makes any slightly moving target (like an 18 month old)almost impossible to shoot. I've had good success shooting almost exclusively in manual focus indoors and out.2. Indoor portrait shots with a flash can cause subject's faces to be very washed out because the of the large aperture size for this lens. If you need to shoot people indoors with a flash I've had more success with the kit lens.My recommendations for using this lens: - Indoor and outdoor still life (with and with - Indoor and outdoor portrait style photosNow that I've had some time to learn what this lens is best used for, I'm very pleased with my purchase. For someone just learning the intracacies of photography, this is an excellent portrait lens to learn on without breaking the bank.""
"20110114","5.0","Great Lens for the Money","If you're on a pretty tight budget but looking to upgrade from the kit lens, DO IT. Yes, it's plastic. Yes, it's fragile.

Can't beat that with a stick!The quality of the build is not that great, however, if you're a photographer who is into better quality gear, you'll probably want to invest in the 1.4 or even the 1.2.""
"20110113","3.0","you get what you pay for","This is a mediocre lens at best. It is very soft wide open. The bokeh is terrible both wide open and stopped down a bit (5 blades). Color and contrast are mediocre as well. The worst part is the AF. It is very inconsistent even in good light.This lens is very popular among beginners, and there was time when it offered much better image quality compared to the old 18-55 kit lens for crop bodies. Not so much anymore because the 18-55 IS is so much better than the old kit. The 50/1.8 can still be useful stopped at least at f/2.8 and it takes super sharp pictures at f/4, when it focuses well (almost never). With a crop body, in a typical scene, f/4 has enough DOF to mask the poor AF. More experienced users will be frustrated however.""

"20110111","5.0","Excellent lens!","This lens is great for portrait photography. Not so for landscapes without a tripod. I discovered that if you are going to use this lens in low light, ISO settings over 800, a tripod is a must. Otherwise, picture will be fuzzy. I would recommend highly. However, without Image stabilization you need a tripod most of the times or a stable base to place the camera. I took great pictures of my kids in the park on a nice clear day and by using the flash in auto setting. However, when you start changing ISO and lighting conditions are not great the pictures without a tripod did not come out very clear. When a tripod was used under the same conditions the pictures came out excellent.Update. I have been taking a lot of pictures with this lens and all I have to say is that this lens is great for portrait photography. I purchased an external flash and after taking pictures with this lens and the external flash I was amazed at the details and clarity of my pictures. Highly recommended. For low light conditions it is fantastic. If used with a tripod you can take great landscape pictures.""
"20110110","5.0","Great portrait lens! Quick review for beginners with ambitions","Picture quality, speed (large max. Aperture) are sensational for the price.The question for me was: will this 50 mm be useful on my 1.6 crop rebel? The answer is yes - absolutely, the focal length of approx. effective 80 mm works very nicely for portrait shots. The range is actually more flexible than what I had expected - it is usable at more than just one distance. My fotos actually have benefited from being forced to one length, with standard zoom I sometimes intuitively zoom to the same framing on each foto. This lens forces some creativety for portrait shots that can help a beginner. Even in low light, it is increadibly easy to shoot decent portraits without flash, because of the large possible aperture. It make a very big difference to be able to shoot around f2 vs. f4.Avoid f1.8, f2.2 is my personal minimum for excellent compromise of speed and sharpness. F2.2 works great in dark indoor rooms.For the price, this lens is amazing!""
"20110110","5.0","Great Lens for a Great Price","I got this lens on a recommendation from a friend and based on the reviews here. I had two kit lenses with my camera (the EF-S 18-55mm IS and the EF-S 55-250mm IS). When I first took it out of the package I was surprised. I had read some reviews stating that it feels cheap and plastic-y, but I figured that I would be unable to tell as I was a novice. However, it was quite obvious to me even as a beginner. That said, I have had this lens for about a year with absolutely no problems. As long as you are not frequently banging this thing into walls, I think that you will be fine.The picture quality is my main focus in this review (pun fully intended). I have not had the opportunity to use the other canon 50mm prime lenses to compare, but this is a huge step above the kit lenses. Allowing you to open up the aperture to f/1.8, this lens allows you to experiment with bokeh to get that 'professional' look to you pictures (particularly portraits). This lens quickly has become my favorite due to it's clarity and versatility, and I use it for pretty much anything besides landscape shots and shots requiring a long lens.On the downside, the auto focus occasionally hunts in low light, but still performs well since it can reach wide apertures. I have found that at f/1.8, the depth of field is so narrow that it is hard to get everything you want in focus (ie. a person's face, and not just their nose). I usually shoot at around f/2.8.On the whole, I think that this is a great lens even if you disregard the low price. Factoring in the value, I can not really think of a reason why any beginner photographer should not own this lens. Definitely recommended!""

This lens beats the zoom lens hands down.  It takes better photos especially in low light conditions.  I have a friend who bought the old version (version 1) of this lens a few years ago and always love the pictures.  That's why I bought this lens and I have not been disappointed.  I find myself choosing this lens over the zoom time and time again.If you just bought a Canon, buy this lens.If you own a canon and don't have a 50mm lens, buy this lensThere are a couple of other, more expensive 50mm lenses from Canon.  I did the research and they aren't worth the money unless you are doing high-end professional photography.  This is smaller and lighter and takes better pictures than the more expensive lenses in some conditions.It's clear that this is not an expensive lens, so if you're trying to look cool, buy something else, but if you're trying to make your pictures look cool, this is what you need.

What I realized was that for most day-to-day shots this works.  Hopefully you are not a sports photographer or interested in shooting wildlife for this woud not work as well.  It is great for candid, close-up shots.  Play with the f-stops depending on your end goal.  the 1.8 f-stop is new for me and I love it for the low light shooting opportunities.

A word of caution for 35mm Luddites:  this 50mm is not a 'standard' lens in the new, digital age.  It is about the equivalent to a 80mm in the dark age, 35mm format.

I am sad to see Canon releasing something with such poor build quality at any price point.Another factor in deciding to return this was that it wasn't any good for manual focus. It has a tiny ring on the end that was difficult to use.

It is so fast, that light is almost never a problem, even without a flash.The lens is also very light in weight and although it definitely feels plastic, I think for the casual photographer the lightness is feature.  It is prime focus, so, you will not be able to zoom with it, but it has a great field of view for portraits and everyday use.  It does not have image stabilization, but because of the speed, you really do not need it.This is by far my favorite lens.  If you are an amateur, it will make your pictures better.""
"20120409","4.0","Amazing beginner's lens","So if you're anything like me, you probably bought the kit lens with your DSLR because it's fairly inexpensive and having a lens is a necessity right?  Well if you haven't learned yet as I did, the kit lens really aren't worth having if you plan on producing nice pictures. You're much better off puting the $50-$100 towards better lenses.Its a true shock when entering the world of photography to see that most lenses cost more than camera bodies! However, this particular lens brings amazing value at it's price point and although it is a prime (no zoom) I would recommend this a 100 times over the kit lens.It is a fast lens at 1.8f which will give you nice bokeh (shallow depth of field)and will work quite well in low light situations. If you're not familiar with shallow depth of field, take a look at some of the pictures others have posted above and you'll see many that have something in focus and the background is out of focus. This is a really nice effect and makes your pictures look much more professional.If you do a lot of manual focusing (or video) the focus ring is pretty cheap and not fluid at all, yet at around $100 you really can't ask for more.  The body is all plastic, but again, there must be sacrices somewhere to achieve this price point.This lens gets 4 stars from me because of the last two points, but only because I've since used many other lenses that I can see where spending the extra money helps (especially since I do a lot of manual focusing), however if I were to rate this compared to the kit lens, ten stars all the way.  Feel free to ask any questions through the comments and I'd be glad to help.

If you do not have a fast lens (2.8 or wider) and you don't want to spend a fortune, this is a great place to start.  Despite what some people say, I find the bokeh quite pleasing on a full frame camera.  It works quite well on my 5d mk iii  (yes I am one of the lucky first few!).  However, this lens is rather noisy and focuses nominally fast.  When attaching the lens hood (purchase separately) it magnifies the sound of the motor a little bit to make it even worse.  I have to admit that I wanted the 50 1.4 and was going to get it, but in the midst of great spending on a new body and new 24-70 2.8L I decided to save myself a couple hundred bucks.  Now I regret that choice because while it focuses quickly enough in medium / good lighting, it does take a while for it to hone in in lower light.  (and that's where these wide lenses shine!)  There is a half second pause as it reverses its focus direction as it gets closer and closer.  This means that it can take up to a good 2-3 seconds to focus depending on the contrast of the image (and that is with the new 5diii af system...).  Admittedly, that is the extreme however when I tested a 50 1.4 in a local shop, the USM was noticeably faster.  In fact, that was the first thing I noticed about that lens.  BOOM.  Locked on.  I'm seriously considering a return even though the IQ of the lens is frankly quite good.  I don't think that I will notice a difference in IQ of the 50 1.4 although I'm sure I'd notice a difference in handling (esp. with the better manual focus ring...)  If you think you'll be manual focusing with this lens at all, guess again.Summary:  IQ = quite nice.  Anomaly for this price.  Handling:  =  not so nice.  While some complain about its plastic construction, I personally have no fears for the quality (longevity) of the lens, but I do not abuse my equipment.  If I pay good money, I also pay good attention...  As for the plastic mount, unless you plan on carrying around your camera body by holding onto the lens, this lens is so  light that honestly it doesn't even matter.  And even then, I've picked up my heavy 5diii with it and had no fear whatsoever.Could you hear me over the focus noise?""
"20120404","4.0","Nearly everyone was right about this lens (except the 1 stars).","This lens sounds like grinding gears when it's auto-focusing. It feels a little cheap and actually rattles when shook. So why did I give it 4 stars?!It is very sharp! And with the f/1.8, I am getting incredible depth! I know there are f/1.4 and even f/1.2 lenses out there but I don't need anything faster than this. Would I love Image Stabilization or a USM motor? ABSOLUTELY! But for 1/4 or 1/8 the price of those other lenses, it CAN NOT be beat!""
"20120404","5.0","Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens","Nice f1.8 prime lens. Can't beat price for performance. This lens is light but has great glass. Auto focus operates much faster when you use the central focus sensor and shut down the peripheral sensors. Lens does not feel like a toy as many reviewers state. Lightness has nothing to do with quality when buying a lens or any portable electronic equipment. Superficial looks are less important than the guts of a lens. Indeed this lens is built economically but in your hand it feels compact and solid. I cannot hear any jiggling of internal parts. If you take good care of your equipment this lens should have no problem serving your low light shooting needs for a long time. On a 1.6 cropped sensor body this 50mm lens yields you  an equivalent 80mm of focal length which is great for portrait shooting. Cost to performance can't be beat. I highly recommend this lens!""
"20120403","5.0","absolutely worth it!","I still consider my photography skills to be very limited, so branching out and purchasing a new lens was a bit scary at first. I spent some time looking at different Canon lenses within the $100-$400 price range and  for some reason kept being led to this one.  I was amazed at how crisp and clear my images were.  I should mention that I rarely ever use flash... And this lens feels like it was made especially for natural lighting conditions.  So far I have used my new lens indoors with very low lighting, outdoors while overcast, and outdoors on a very sunny day (no flash in any of those settings) and my pictures come out AMAZING! I could not be more pleased with my purchase!!!""

"20101225","5.0","Canon 50mm F1.8 Review","Got this lens after owning the Canon 50mm F1.4.  Like the 50mm F1.8 a lot more.  The 50mm F1.8 is useable wide-open where the f1.4 is quite soft.  The 50mm F1.4 has more flare than I could tolerate, the 50mm F1.8 much less flare.  The focus on the 50mm F1.8 is a bit slow and noisy - like the kit lens (18-55).  No matter, this lens take Sharp Pictures!  Plan to use it at weddings and for personal use.  Update 02/19/2011:  Used this lens set at F2.8 on an Engagement Shoot.  Gave nice blurred background and sharp on the couple.  The coupled loved the pictures!  Have not noticed the harsh blur others knock this lens about. Update 3/26/2011: This lens has earned the name of Bread & Butter or ChaChing for short. When it is used for Engagement or Trial shoots, the wedding is bagged due to the sharp pictures and great bokeh from this lens.  Very impressive picture quality - sharpness and blur ability. Update 4/21/2011:  Used this lens exclusively on a Bridal Portrait shoot.  It rocked the H*LL out of it!  Stunning pictures, sharp on focus point, beautiful blurred background.  Primarily used in the F2.8->F5.6 range. Update 5/21/2011: Ok, so this lens frequently does not perfectly focus wide open or near wide open, even so the pictures are sharp enough at smaller viewing sizes and the client is distracted by the lovely out of focus parts of the photograph.  They have not seen a photograph quite like this being that all they have been seeing comes out of a camera phone!  Got a trial shoot this Sunday.  Going to mount the 50MM 1.8 as primary with the Tamron 17-50 F2.8 DII as backup.  Shooting outside.  Update 7/9/2011: Why do I keep writing about this lens!?  It Rocks is why! Use this lens on Trial Shoots and always get the gig.  Shot a picture of an engaged couple - F5.6.  Very Sharp!  Looked around the internet - you would be Very Hard Pressed to find a lens that could take a sharper picture at F5.6 and this is a $100 lens!  Enough said (I hope)!""
"20101225","5.0","Amazing value","This is probably the best value for a lens I've ever seen. If you're new to prime lenses and want to start out small and cheap this is what you want.""
"20101224","5.0","Amazed!","I'll keep it simple...Pros:-Very lightweight-Inexpensive-Amazingly sharp-Depth of Field for days!Cons:-Inexpensive construction (but it was $99!)-Slower, noisy A/F (again, $99!)I'd buy it again without hesitation.""
"20101223","5.0","Like most everybody says","Like most Internet reviews say, this is a great all around prime.  Definitely the best buy around at about a hundred bucks.  It is a bit soft wide open at 1.8 but very sharp when stopped down some. Materials feel cheap but it works.  The manual focus ring and switch are a bit stiff and thin to grab.  It is very light and compact though.  AF motor is a bit loud.  All in all for the price and image quality I love it.  Great for portraits and low light shots.""
"20101220","5.0","Great Lens at an even better price","This lens is great. I use it on my Canon Rebel XSi along with my kit 18-55mm lens and my 75-300mm lens. The optics are a better quality than most kit lenses, and the AF is quick. The picture quality is superb. Low light quality is amazing with the 1.8 f-stop, and the 50mm focal length works well in almost all situations and gives you a great depth of field. I use this lens in all sorts of situations, such as family events, portraits, product shots, and on-location shots while I'm filming commercials. It's quick, simple, and small, so I'm not fiddling with it to get my pictures, I just aim and shoot. Though it is made of plastic, the construction in snug, no loose parts, and it doesn't feel like if you set it down too hard it will shatter. Overall I would highly suggest this lens to anyone, from seasoned to newbie, a low f-stop fixed focal length lens always comes in handy.update: After owning this lens for a year, it's still in great condition and works just fine. image quality is still just as great, and I still love using it.""

"20101216","5.0","One of the best lenses I have ever tried!","This lens is very fast with a 1.8 aperture. The depth of field when on 1.8 is 1.5 ft.

"20101214","5.0","Wonderful Lens for the money","This lens has rapidly replaced my old 18-55mm kit lens as my go-to lens for most situations. The wide aperture makes it great for indoor shots without flash and night shots using just city lights. It opens up a whole new door in terms of creativity, and I can't recommend it more as a second lens, especially on a budget. That said, here are the few problems I noticed:The autofocus is rather slow when close up to things, and if you're taking pictures of all black subjects (cats, dogs, etc) or mostly monochromatic things in low light it will have a lot of trouble getting a lock. The Focus motors are also quite loud.Cheap feeling construction. The build is plastic, which means it won't last as long as an all metal one, but it has a better cement bounce factor if you're a Klutz like me. Also, If Bokeh is important to you, the aperture has only 5 blades, making the bokeh distinctly pentagonal.If either of these things is a problem, and you have the spare cash, you may as well go for the 50mm f/1.4 that goes for ~350 here. If not or if it really is your second lens ever, may as well go for this one and play around with it. I've been very pleased with it!""

I needed to get a bit closer than with my 60mm so I could get good expression without being so close as to have the dogs want to jump into my arms, and I needed the availability of shooting in natural light indoors, both of which this lens offers.  So far, with limited use, I have been extremely happy with the results!!It has great glass and the shots come out crystal clear and sharp.  Even when used with the flash I can't complain.  I have been using it outside for some action shots and love the results there as well.We novice photographers seem to think the end all, be all is with a zoom lens but I am way liking my prime lenses!  I already have a 60mm and a 105mm... this one is a great addition to the others.I bought this based mainly on reviews here on Amazon, and so far, it is exactly what I hoped I was going to be getting!

I was shooting a friend with his infant daughter and it was difficult to keep them both in frame as they were playing.

"20101205","2.0","Very poor build quality","I bought this less than a year back and have always used it, as with all my lens, with great care. But one fine day it simply made a loud motor sound on the Auto-focus and fell apart! I mean, literally, the glass lens along with the focal ring detached from the lens barrel exposing the motor and the inner construction of the lens! I was dumb-founded. I have rarely encountered anything with such an atrocious build quality. I love my Canon Digital SLR, what went wrong with this Canon lens? How can Canon company sell such an unreliable product? What would happen if I had to use my camera as a reporter would---under more extreme conditions? It would fall apart in weeks. I think the pieces were glued together. I am honestly shocked. The f-stop is great, the lens takes sharp warm pictures, the bokeh could have been better... it is light and fast. But don't buy it. The lens will become your favorite and then suddenly one day, in a crucial moment simply break down.

"20101205","4.0","Great for consumer, alright for Professional","In good light, the results can be amazing.  In low light, it can practically see in the dark.I shot my first wedding as a second shooter yesterday.  During the reception, I was taking pictures on the dark dance floor with lighting only available from the DJ booth's lights. I was shooting a 40D, no flash, f/1.8, ISO 1600, AV mode.  Auto focus would not work so I flipped over to manual and went to town in High Drive.  Many were out of focus, but I did manage to get a good amount of amazing money shots.In good to moderate light, the autofocus is reliable most of the time on my 40D.  The non-USM motor is a bit annoying in how slow and noisy it is but for only $100, totally acceptable.  Build quality is descent, and the plastic doesn't bother me.If you are a consumer and don't depend on this to get the shot or not get paid, buy it in a heartbeat.  For the price you would be crazy to not have this.If you are a pro (I doubt you would be reading this) I would consider the 50mm f/1.4 or 1.2.  I haven't used that lens, but the USM motor alone would be worth the extra cash.""

This lens fell out of my camera back and hit the ground from a height of about 3 inches and promptly split into two pieces.  I took it to a lens repair shop and they said it would be more expensive to fix than replace.

I shot some aquarium animals at about 2 feet at f1.8 and discovered that I only had about 1/4 inch DOF. At the maximum focus range this thing rocks.

The focusing is good and fast on the mark 2. There is no manual focus override. The AF is fast and accurate albeit very noisy.The bokeh is good but at times it feels crude. There is significant light falloff at 1.8 . The lens is sharp but not super sharp till you get down to f4 and below. I use the Nikon 50 1.8 on a D700 body and I find it more sharp with less fall off and color fringing compared to the Canon 50 1.8. The canon also has a lot of ghosting when shooting into direct lights during the day as well as night. Having also seen pictures of the Canon 50 1.4, I  personally would dish out a few extra dollars. The difference in these two lenses in terms of price maybe a deal breaker for some but for me a lens with much less ghosting and color fringing and less light fall off wide open deserves the few extra hundred but that's just me.""

There is no question that this should be the first or second lens that you pick up after entering into the DSLR space (after the kit lens that comes with your camera).Personally, this was my first experience with a prime lens and I absolutely love it.  Prime lenses tend to give much higher image clarity for the price, and this is no exception.  This boosted the quality of my portrait shots by a huge margin - everything now seems crisper and brighter.Moreover, this lens is FAST.  With this lens, you won't need a 5D to shoot in low-light without a flash!  I can get great results in nearly any lighting condition without a flash if I combine this lens with a 1600ISO setting on my camera, and I don't even need a tripod!Word of caution - because this is a prime lens, there's no zoom (if you haven't figured that out already).  Also, 50mm on a Rebel means that you're fairly well zoomed in already, so you will need ~10 feet between you and your subject if you are shooting portraits.""
"20101122","4.0","It is indeed Nifty","Ok so basically i call this a disciplinary lens , since it is a fixed lens it definitely teaches you to zoom with your feet and forces you to experiment with range. Although it is a low light lens , DO NOT be disappointed when the auto focus creeps. The AF sucks. I rarely use AF on any lens always MF. The depth of field is really strong so its great for portrait photos. The casing is made of plastic but I haven't had any problems with it. I personally love the lens.

"20101121","1.0","Apparently My Turn To Get A Lemon","I bought this lens specifically because I had an opportunity to attend my first boxing event and needed a fast, low-light lens. This lens was highly recommended.  When I received lens I took a few test shots and discovered the lens not as sharp as I had expected based on the comments in the evaluations.  The kit lens on my Canon T2i was much sharper.Several days after lens arrived I attended the event.  Still in the first round of the first match, camera in the continuous shooting mode, I got a notice saying communication problem between lens and camera, clean the lens contacts. I removed the lens, wiped off the contacts, assembled camera and lens and resumed shooting.  Almost immediately another notice and another cleaning.  One more notice and cleaning and the camera stopped working.  My only solution was to use the kit lens and the result, as I feared, is no useful shots.  Everything is pitch black as though the event was taking place at midnight on a very dark night.The photos that I managed to take with the 50mm before it stopped working aren't bad.  Because I was trying to shoot at 400 or 500 to stop the action in limited light, they are somewhat dark but this can be corrected in Photoshop Elements.  There is also some blurriness of the sort I experienced with the first test shots, but I attribute this to a defect in this lens. What I am saying is that this lens seems to have been a good choice for my purpose, but because it was defective I am giving this lens only 1 star.Lens is being returned to Amazon.I have ordered a lot from Amazon over the years and always read the evaluations first.  Invariably, no matter how many 4 and 5 star ratings are given a product, there are at least a couple from people disappointed because product was defective.  This seems to have been my turn to be one of those people.""
"20101120","4.0","Meh, shouldn't have traded from the 1.4","I sold my 50 1.4 to purchase some flash equipment, but after purchasing this lens I wish I would have kept the 1.4. I read that this is plastic construction, but it just feels cheap (at $100) I guess it is.""
"20101117","5.0","Worked great for my son's hockey game","I needed a fast lens to take pictures of my son's hockey games.  Hockey rinks are probably the hardest place to take great pictures.  The lighting is usually poor, the surface bright (forcing a manual overexposure thereby giving up some shutter speed), and the action is very fast.  Also, focusing through a puck-scuffed glass panel is another challenge in itself.I recently purchased a Canon Rebel XS with the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens kit.  The pictures from the first hockey game were not very good.  The rink was one of the best in terms of overhead lighting intensity.  I set the ISO to 1600, zoomed the lens to max (55mm), set the focus to servo mode (continuous focus of moving objects), set the camera to aperture priority, and set aperture to the fastest setting for 55mm (f/5.6).  Since hockey rinks (surface and boards) are white, I had to set the exposure compensation to +2/3 so my son's image would not turn out too dark.  Since 55mm is not a large zoom range, I stood next to the glass near the other team's goalie (my son's a forward).  Unfortunately the shutter speed for all the pictures was between 1/50 and 1/80; way too slow to capture a fast moving sport. The only pictures that looked acceptable were face-offs and when my son was parked in front of the net.I purchased this 50mm 1.8 lens and used it this weekend for a hockey tournament.  The rink was at the other extreme in lighting; i.e., one of the worse lit.  For the 1PM game there was a bit of sun light coming in from a few small windows, so I set the ISO to 800.  I again set the exposure compensation to +2/3.  I used shutter priority this time and set the speed to 1/125.  That was fast enough to freeze the body motion and allowed for a nice blur effect of the hockey stick and puck when my son took a shot.  The aperture bounced between f/1.8 and f/2.8; the higher f-stops gave me a little deeper depth of field that helped put my son and the goalie in better focus.  The lens had no trouble with servo focus mode (continuous focusing of a moving object).  The biggest issues with focus was the marks on the glass and the other players skating in front of my son when I had the focus locked on him. In spite of that, the pictures turned out very nice; exceeding my expectations. The lack of image stabilization didn't seem to matter.  The fact that I captured a nice shot of my son scoring the first goal of the tournament (cool shot where my son and the goalie were in focus and you can see the puck under the goalie heading for the net) already justified the $100 purchase.  When I came back for the evening game, there was obviously no sun light boost from the windows, so I had to bump the ISO up to 1600.  Again, I captured many nice shots.I can't wait for a game at one of the better lit rinks.  I plan on using shutter priority and setting the speed to 1/250 or 1/500.This lens is definitely staying on the camera. I took identical pictures comparing the lens kit and this lens, and I can see the difference in clarity.  I did notice a slight darking of the corners at f/1.8 when I took a picture of the sky; however, if I wasn't looking for it, I probably would not have noticed it.This lens is a must have for parents with kids who play indoor sports (e.g., hockey, basketball, karate, wrestling, gymnastics, ballet, etc).BTW - The f/1.8 lens may be the sweet spot for lens speed.  There is a good (but highly technical) discussion in the DP-Review Open Talk forum titled 'Light loss on current sensors at big Fstops, part II' regarding light loss on high speed lens.  Basically, fast lens (f/1.2 - f/1.4) pass light to the digital sensor at a very sharp angle and, as a result, there is signal loss of about 1/2 stop.  That makes an f/1.4 the equivalent to an f/1.8 lens.  The dSLR camera bodies (all manufacturers) detect the high-speed lens and compensate by 'electronically' increasing the sensor signal gain.  That kind of defeats the purpose of spending the extra (and large) sum of money for a fast lens.""

Now I find that they've turned out better then I expected them to. (Sharp and clear, wonderful color) The Bokeh quality is very nice. I even found that some of the photos that I didn't focus properly with turned out looking beautiful kind of like a painting.The Only thing that I have a hard time with is that I need a lot more room because I have to step back a bit to get full image/person pics, but that's really nothing against the lens (actually it's forcing me to pay closer attention)Anyhow, that's my two cents :)""

"20101111","5.0","The best small investment!","I turned my hobby of taking pics into a profession, and have a tight budget. So I bought the 50 1.8 to put on my Canon Rebel xs. This is my primary lens, so almost 100% of all my pics are taken with it. It is amazing in low light and very sharp so my images look professional with out the price! I love this lens, but my only issue has been it has a very small view. So it looks like an 80mm on my cropped Rebel. This can be tricky in tight spaces and shooting groups since I loose quality as I have to walk farther back to get the group shot. I find this even tricky with a family of 3! The 50mm 1.8 is a perfect lens to shoot portraits of 1 person! It does a nice job with two, but I find myself searching for a cheap wide prime on Amazon like the 28mm 2.8 that will help with taking group shots.I shot a wedding this year ( my first) and found that shooting from 30mm to 70mm was very needed. I rented lots of lenses and the Canon MarkII that was fabulous! The Mark II has a very high ISO capability and with the 50mm 1.2 I was able to shoot in a dark barn with no flash with very little noise! So that is on my wish list! My site is under construction, but you can check me out on flickr. My flickr acct lists the camera that is used, and for the most part it is the rebel with the 50mm, when you see the Canon MarkII listed, I was using a rental lens the 24-70 L 2.8.

"20101025","5.0","Better shots than most L-series zoom lenses","I understand I am comparing Fuji Apples to Gala Apples, but when I compare the image quality from this cheap, plastic-bodied prime lens to those from my several L-series Canon zooms, there is no contest: this lens outperforms. Now to those who say one cannot compare a prime to a zoom, I say: why not? Aren't we discussing image quality or are we discussing something else?Given the very large images produced by modern DSLRs, I can crop the image from this 50mm and get the zoom effect I need given the minimum zoom of 50mm (times crop factor). I can also place this lens on my Elan 7 film camera and get spectacular results. I use this lens more and more and zoom using my physical zoom (feet) and digital zoom (Photoshop or Aperture or any image editing software). The results are always great. No, I cannot print to 40x60 inches if I crop from this lens, but I am not planning to do that anyway.When I shoot a wedding (not bridal portraits, I use the 85mm prime for that) the photos made using this lens are always the best and always the favorites. I know it does not have the little red ring around it but that is just to show other photographers that you are hip and with it, not necessarily to get better images and certainly not based on the money-to-image-quality ratio. Nope, buying a more expensive camera or a more expensive lens will NOT make you a better photographer. Using a prime lens, however, like this very affordable option, will certainly improve your images.The cons are obvious: low build quality. This means that the lens is likely to last for only ten years or so, judging by the fact that other Canon primes (and all Canon lenses in general) are notoriously and incredibly reliable (the more expensive f/1.4 version of this lens a notable exception, but still very, very, very reliable).The sum of all my comments is but this: for the money, there is no finer nor more useful lens for your Canon EOS Camera.""
"20101025","5.0","There is a reason they call this the "nifty fifty."","Being pretty new to DSLR camera's (a few weeks) may give me a different point of view. This was my third lens to go with the 18-135mm kit lens. On a recent trip to the Jack-O-Lantern spectacular at the Roger Williams Zoo I took this lens after having received it in the mail earlier in the day. I had my 18-135mm in my pocket and thought it would be nice being able to zoom in & out as need to frame shots but the 50mm worked out perfect. The light gathering ability of the 50mm over the 18-135mm F3.5 - F5.6 is immediately noticeable! Each and every picture came out great and I was even able to get a few pictures of a few fountains that had just a hint of lighting in them by using the timer and placing the camera on a steady mount. The only problems I may have with this lens is the body is plastic and does feel somewhat 'cheap' and the focusing ring is somewhat hard to find in the manual focus mode. But otherwise this lens is well worth every penney, especially for a dslr noob!""

The colors are good, the light captured is very impressive due to the F1.8 aperture. Being used to a F3.5 - 5.6 lens showed me what a F 1.8 can do without flash. Pretty impressive. However, I have found the focussing on this lens to be quite a task, esp in low lights and when using auto focussing.1. I don't trust autofocus on this one as it sometimes focuses on objects which you don't intend to.2. Manual focus has to be dead precise, else images turn out to be either out of focus or partially focussed and the rest of it is blurred due to the DOF, increasing the f stop does help in some areas.3. It is very difficult to ascertain whether the focus is proper when shooting outdoors in low light conditions. I paired this up with a Canon 40D and some images which seemed properly focussed during in-camera review turned out be out of focus on the large screen !!I am still going through the learning paces to use this wonderful lens and hopefully would overcome the focus issue I have been having with this.Highly recommended for those looking to experiment with DOF for their photography skills.""

"20101011","2.0","A slight disappointment","I'm happy and I'm disappointed. I'm happy I didn't buy the big sister to this lens. Not at 4 times the cost of this lens. From f1.8 to about f4.0 this lens is almost useless. I know, I know, a lot of people have shots posted here that they like at 1.8, but if you could blow them up to 100%, you'd see what we used to call grain and is now referred to as noise. This lens eats light for breakfast, and little into lunch. I use a Canon T1i, by no means a slouch of camera. At first I thought there might be something wrong with the lens I received, but there doesn't seem to be. I was invited to take some pictures of people in a hospice. Until I mounted my 430xi II flash, the pictures, almost all shot indoors, were fine to the naked eye, but if you take them up to 100%, they granulate. Adding the flash, http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Speedlite-II-Digital-Cameras/dp/B001CCAISE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1286808573&sr=8-1, a great unit by the way, took all the worry about shooting inside. I've noticed quite a few people bragging about their shots, but the depth of field is so shallow, you have to be right on top of it to get your subject in focus. Again, I thought this might be just me,so I went to a couple of respected lens reviews and lo and behold, they had the same comments. The f1.8 and the 1.4 both suffer at low light levels. Now, one of the reasons I suspect that many people buy a lens like this is to shoot in low light without a flash. Which is good, and I understand the desire/necessity of doing this, but you should realize that without a bright source of light, you're usable focus area at f1.8 on this lens and on the 1.4, will be about the size of a quarter on a 4x6' print. The sites report the same findings I found in my every day, unscientific, shooting. You need light, lots of it, to really shoot pictures with this lens. If you need to enlarge them at all, you should be at least at f5.6. Once I was outside and able to get the lens closed down to f8, the lens rocks. I used the flash as a fill and it really balanced out the picture. I will use the lens in special circumstances, but not as my walking around lens.""
"20101011","5.0","Great Value","Great Product. Great Price. A little cheap on the materials. But all in all the best lens for the dollar.""
"20101009","5.0","Everybody should have this","Everybody should have this lens.  It is so cheap and so effective at doing what it does.I initially bought this lens for the 1.8 f/stop alone.  I am slowly building up my photography gear and needed a 'faster' lens.  I felt like I had been extremely limited by not having a lens that could perform well in low light situations w/o the use of flash.  This lens solved that problem.  I have been able to shoot in light that I have never before been able to shoot in w/o a tripod, etc.  Of course having spent most of my time shooting with a standard zoom lens, being limited to the 50mm is difficult to get used to at first, but also forces you to compose your shots within the frame instead of relying on zooming in and zooming out, not a bad skill to have!  Of course the one major problem with this lens is now I desperately I want a faster zoom lens hahaI took some time for me to get used to using the large aperture openings simply because of the extremely limited depth of field, which of course, is an effect that I wanted by buying a lens like this, but when the lens if fully open it was really a shock to me initially how little is actually in focus.  It took some getting used to, so if you have never shot with a wide open aperture before, you might also find that it takes some getting used to to, as far of just what you can and can't do with this lens.A couple true cons:  This lens is a bit noisy when it is autofocusing. I sometimes feel reluctant to use in situations that require quiet.  Secondly, the autofocusing has problems finding the correct focus in certain situations.  Often this is remedied by moving back from the subjects just a little.  I've encountered this issue with canon's autofocus system on other lenses as well, it just seems to be a distance and/or lighting situation.I was hoping to get pretty bokeh effect with this as well, and while it isn't quite as smooth as I hoped, in certain situations it performs well to create that.  I'm happy for what I paid for it in that respect when it comes to that effect.I do think if you dropped this lens on a hard service, most likely you would not have this lens anymore.  However, depending on the fall and what it hits, it could be quite possible to say that for a lot of lenses.So I received this, this is the lens that has been on my camera more often than not.  Lots of uses and produces fabulous images.""

"20101007","5.0","Best Lens in my Kit","This lens has a beautifully small depth of field that makes every picture it takes just amazing.  It is an astounding $100, but this does not make it a bad lens at all.  It is one of my favorite lenses, and the most fun to use.  It really makes pictures look professional and you can get creative with it.This lens should be in every photographer's bag.  And I'm not just saying that because everyone else does!  I completely agree with the statement.It is such a tiny lens, you can bring it with you everywhere.  You SHOULD bring it with you everywhere.It is probably the highest awesome-to-cost ratio by a long shot for lenses. It is on par with my thousand dollar lenses in awesome.The only downside is that it does not have a variable focal length, but this is what they make.  It is not really that big of a deal.  It only annoyed me once when i was taking a group shot of 4 people, but in hindsight, I should have used one of my other lenses for group shots anyway - you can't really use the 1.8 with 4 people. (I usually use this lens with 1.8 or 2.8 otherwise I would use my other lens which has a larger zoom range)  I found that out the hard way with half the people's faces blurred!  The focal length is a good distance on my small sensor camera (Rebel XSi).I have heard some people comment on its build quality and how it is 'plastic'.  I can't really debate this much because I'm not an expert on 'build quality.'  I can tell you that for most people out there, you will not think this has bad build quality.  I guess it's plastic, it seems just as good as my other lenses!  Unless you REALLY care about build quality, I think you will be happy with this lens.  I never once looked at it and thought it was of a low quality construction.  I haven't dropped it, nor do I plan to, but if I do and it breaks... it was $100 dollars!  I will buy it again within the hour and wait anxiously for its arrival, hoping I will not need it in the meantime.They also offer the 50mm f/1.4 for $300 I believe.  I am a serious amateur, hoping to get into the business, and I feel no need to get the 1.4 ever.  1.8 is small enough.  1.4 isn't worth the money, and would probably be more difficult to make sure the focus isn't on a person's nose instead of their eyes.  Pictures with that much blur just get to be annoying in my opinion.  I would buy the f/1.8 3 times without any regrets over the 1.4 if I lost it or broke it a bunch of times (I'm usually very careful, so I plan to only buy it once).It is EXCELLENT in low light.  Aside from creative shots and beautifully blurred backgrounds on portraits, it is a lifesaver in low light.  I don't like using flash very often because I love candid shots.  This lens is perfect in low light.  Can't get much better than this!Having a f/1.8 is indispensable for a photographer.I can't say enough good things about this lens.Pros:  Like a millionCons: Zilch!""
"20101007","5.0","Great lens, small package, smaller price","I bought this lens in September 2010, and it hasnt left my Canon XS since. This lens is probably one of the best lens for price to quality ratio.It is small, the fixed length at 50MM is not too close, but not too narrow, the F/1.8 is amazing, autofocus works fairly quickly. My only problem is I sometimes feel like it I am going to break it while focusing. The focus ring is made of cheapish plastic and doesnt always feel secure on the lens, and has an extremely slight wobble. The lens also makes a slight noise, like if you hit 2 pieces of plastic together lightly. I dont know if it is meant to do that, or if it my focus motor trying to turn the lens more then it should. Though for the price, it doesnt bother me much.I have heard a lot of people say that they are getting this while they save up for the 50mm F/1.4, but frankly, I wont even bother with that lens until I have too much money and this F/1.8 breaks.Pros- Cheap-good glass/picture quality-small-easy to use-quick and sharp autofocusCons-construction kind of questionable sometimes-made of plasticlast note- This lens is a 52mm opening lens, and all of my filters and lens caps I have will not work, since they are all for 58mm lenses. This might mean you have to buy new filters, unless you already own some 52mm lens filters.""
"20101006","5.0","Basic Lens","This is a great beginner to intermediate lens, especially for people who like to fool around with aperture.  It is primarily a portrait lens but of course you can use it for other things too.  It does a great job with flowers and other nature shots if that's more your thing.So far I've only used mine on my 20D but it's supposed to work on my film Rebel also.  The pictures are sharp, colors are great, and if you don't mind not being able to zoom and you don't have much money to spend, I would definitely say to check out this lens.""

"20101003","4.0","Really good for the price, especially with proper use","I LOVE this lens, it was cheap and gets AMAZING images. I have a Canon 7D and have had no problems with it sticking to the camera, although I've heard with that that it could be you are mounting it wrong you need to make sure you read the directions and mount it on the EF lens mount. The autofocus isn't great but as long as you use proper focusing techniques and use it in good light it will perform GREAT. In low light it will be slightly off on its focusing and appear 'soft' but I have taken NUMEROUS images at f/1.8 that have come out tack sharp, see my example photos! Also, I am a professional photographer. The bokeh isn't the prettiest, clearly far from the 50mm L lens and even noticeably worse than the 50mm f/1.4  but if you're like me and just wanted a cheap prime lens with wide aperture capabilities that you could try out this lens is AMAZING. As long as you know what you're doing this lens is a great choice. For the average user you will probably be disappointed with it because the focus with often be off but then again the average user isn't trying to get tack sharp photos necessarily in which case this lens would be great for you. It really depends on what you are using it for, your knowledge of photography and what things are important to you. Overall I think this is a great lens for the money.""

"20100923","4.0","100% worth the money","I got this lens a few weeks ago.  At the time, I was hoping to get it in under 3 days because I had clients that wanted to shoot a music video in the streets of a city at night as well as in a few parties that naturally, would be very dark. I needed a f1.8 or lower lens that could shoot in the required low light location that wasn't going to kill my budget.  I picked this lens up and it showed up to my doorstep on the 3rd day, right before I packed up to take the 2 hour drive.  On the way I rode with my client and I fiddled around with my new lens to get a feel for it before actual shooting.  Initially, I liked it.  The auto focus was good, the image quality of the mountains I was driving through was spectacular, and I could still keep the ISO down near 100 as we got closer to sunset.  I already knew it was going to perform well as far as low light goes, but I wasn't sure about the shakyness of it because it is not an IS lens and we were going to be walking so I couldn't throw a tripod under it.  We got there and I started shooting and it was a lot more steady then I had expected.  I followed the group for about an hour just walking around until the party was starting.  We went to the party and the ONLY light source was christmas lights, and that was it.  It was really dark.  I bumped the camera to f1.8 and ISO to 1600 (the maximum I will shoot at on the T2i due to 3200 and up gets a little noisy).  The video was still fairly dark, but you could still very easily make out what was happening.  I'm quite sure that If I had my 18-55mm lens on for instance, I would have seen nothing.  About this time I noticed the first problem with this lens which is simply me not thinking through the specs that are listed.  It's 50mm, which pretty much means if someone is standing 4 feet away from you, you're still only going to be able to frame their face and thats about it.  No wide angle shots whatsoever with this lens, which made it hard in a party where it was packed body tight.  So if I wanted to shoot a picture of a group, I had to ask them to step back a good 7 feet, which wasn't going to happen because more people would just fill in the vacant area.  So for this party, I just shot some simple scenes from a distance because I didn't have much choice.So onto the next party of the night, It was a blacklight party, so their was no source of light except black lights everywhere, which I thought might do some weird effects to the final image but it actually just put a really wicked blue feel to it.  So with no actual light, it was really dark. The lens really came through here for a few reasons.  First and foremost was I could see what was happening clearly regardless of how low light the party was.  2ndly, To put more of a focus on my clients, using a f1.8 could make them in focus, but the people 1 foot behind them completely blurred out for some intense depth of field shots.  The bad thing was, once again, I had to have them move about 5 feet away and still the only thing I could frame was their head.  So I literally jammed myself into a corner to get as far back as possible to compensate.  while jammed up in this position and trying to record on manual focus, I realized problem number 2.  With a steadycam and camera, jammed up in a corner, focusing without getting my fingers in the shot just wasn't going to happen.  This lens should probably REQUIRE a follow focus or focus ring because the focus ring it has now is literally right at the glass of the camera.  So while they were constantly swaying back in forth to the music, I tried to stay in focus and it was very tough.So now that my story is over, I'll talk a little bit about the lens outside my situation.  I LOVE this lens for outdoor portrait photography.  It let's me stay far away from my subject but still frame them nicely.  It also let's me focus on them and have the background REALLY blurred out.  (the DOF on any lens under f1.8 should be amazing).  The build quality seems a little cheap, A little more plasticy and fragile then my other lenses.  The autofocus on this lens is fast and responds well.  The only problem I've had with is is if someone is 3 feet away and u try to focus it, It just won't focus to anything because it doesn't have that much of a focus distance.  Taking a few steps back and focusing again always works.Overall though, for the price, you can't lose.  A month later and I still use this lens a lot.  I don't regret this purchase one bit.  Worth every penny.""
"20100922","4.0","Great lens for the price","Lens and delivery as advertised. Great lens for the price. Crisp focus. Would recommend to a friend.""
"20100921","3.0","For the price it's great, but it really isn't a blow-you-away lens","I bought this early on and then picked up its 1.4 'upgrade' during one of the old triple rebate things. This is how I would compare (have a full frame to do the comparisons):bokeh/out of focus bits: 1.8 is really awful and in my opinion unusable. 1.4 is good in general except maybe pinpoints of light can sometimes look funny. the 24-70 2.8L does a better job.sharpness: both are great, 1.4 might be a bit better, especially in cornersother image quality issues: the 1.4 would show better corners more widely open often, but generally it's pretty close even with 100% view comparisonsbuild quality: the 1.8 is really fragile feeling. the 1.4 is noticably better, though compared to my other lenses still feels a bit less sturdy. My 1.4 focus motor actually blew out after 2 years, but the fine folks at Canon fixed it in 10 days for only around $80.focusing: the 1.8 misses more often. the 1.4 hunts a bit more often, but seems to hit things spot on once it finds the mark. With the 5DmII, the 1.4 doesn't seem to hunt ever, but I might also be better at catching focus points.If you are deciding between the 1.4 and 1.8, I'd just go with the 1.4... it's a better lens and it will resell for close to what you pay anyhow. If it's between the 1.8 and not getting any of them, I would totally recommend it. It will definitely out-perform any zoom at the 50mm mark except maybe the 24-70 in certain circumstances (but not all).I sold the 1.8 and I don't miss it.""

"20100917","4.0","Best lens for the price","Great little lens for the money ... I got it for the price. Shots are above average compared to others in same price range. However, beware, it's pretty much a plastic lens... the housing feels very cheap and quality in build but just be careful when you are traveling or waking around with it. Actually it's so cheap in price, if it does break just buy another one. But I know Canon will honor any issue with it. I recommend this buy""
"20100916","5.0","Good lens except some imperfection (changed my review from 4 to 5 stars)","Overall it is a very impressive product. With 1000+ review, automatically it is a success. Optically, it is larger than the retail price ($100 at year of 2009). You can get all its merits from other reviews, so I will not waste your time. The only complain I have is the focus speed is kind of slow possibly because of the lack of USM.However, my lens come with physical imperfection. Immediately, I noticed that there a stain on the outside of the back element of the lens. Look like it is a drop of liquid was dried there. Fortunately, the stain can be wiped off. Even before cleaning, it didn't affect optical outcomes of the lens. But I just felt very uncomfortable with the facts that happened on a supposedly new lens.""

"20120402","5.0","Best Value","Others can review the finer points of this lens better than I, but for $100 I don't think you can get a Canon lens that takes better pictures. It also takes beautiful HD video if you can live with the 50mm focal length.""
"20120402","3.0","Affordable but not without tradeoffs","Everyone knows this lens. If you're looking for a 50mm prime, you know there are 3 choices from Canon. The almighty 50/1.2, 50/1.4, or this 50/1.8. The 1.8 is a natural buy especially for beginners b/c it's so affordable. Prices usually fluctuate from $90-120.I'm using a T3i/600D. My views of this lens:- For what I use it for, which is indoor shooting with available light, wide open at 1.8 is not terribly sharp. But the shutter speed gain is great, plus I don't have to boost ISO as much.- It's EXTREMELY cheaply made. Really, this thing is all plastic, feels very hollow and feels like a toy. It's also a bit big compared to some other 50 out there (i.e., Minolta's excellent 50/1.7). I would not be surprised if you found lots of dust and debris inside after awhile.- AF is very slow and noisy. Sometimes it will hunt for 5 seconds before finally locking or sometimes it will not lock at all.  At a recent housewarming party, I had to use it in manual b/c the AF just simply refused to lock in the majority of the shots. This is very annoying.But what do you expect for $100, right?  So as long as you can keep the expectations vs pricepoint reality check in line, I think you'll get great use out of this lens.  For how I use this lens, I find the focal length too long for indoors where I'm taking photos of people. I find myself hitting the walls after having backed up so much. Looking now for a lens in the 28mm range but I need to prepare myself to pay a lot more.""
"20120330","2.0","Great photos, lousy build quality!","Photos are great even in low light.  I had mine about a year before the auto focus stopped working.  Even when it did work it was really sloooow.  This lens is plastic and cheap.I'm now springing for the 1.4 (metal) version.""
"20120330","5.0","Amazing Prime Lens especially for the price","I was very skeptical about all the raving reviews for this lens. At a price point of around $120 I thought there was know way it would be any count. However, I really needed a low apature lens for an indoor event, and this lens was just amazing. I ended up also using this lens for a senior portrait session. For this the F1.8 was provided just a little too much depth of field for my taste, but after increasing to F4.0 the pictures came out very sharp, and my customer was very happy. There's something about this lens that makes me want to keep it on my camera more than my 24-105L.""

At beginning I was scared that I may not be able to get it off my T3 camera if I put on after reading some reviews that it stuck on camera body in a few cases. I tried anyway and I am happy I did not encounter such a situation. I took a few shots. The quality is good, even though I cannot see obvious differences than the shots made by my EF-S 18~55mm zoom lens while I set the aperture at 4.0. My issue is that I found out that my T3 camera shows the shots by this lens are in aperture 4.0 instead of the expected 1.8. Could anybody tell me why? I score it one star because it is not f/1.8. If somebody tells me I am wrong about this I can correct myself by adding more stars later.-----That's was my fault. Rate it as 5 stars.""
"20120328","5.0","Perfect Convention Lens","Picked this lens up specifically for an Anime / Gaming convention I was going to.  Price is low which always worries me when it comes to photography, but sample pics I saw online looked good for me.  I needed something for low light and something that would either be guaranteed to take abuse of the crowds at a con or be cheap enough to replace.  Well, it fit the second part fine, and surprisingly it took some pretty hard hits in the crowds and is still working fine.This lens is loud when shooting with it, but the person your shooting is not going to hear it.  This could be a con to some people but for me it's not a high pitch or anything I would consider obstructive / annoying.Wide open there is some Chromatic Aberration, nothing that wasn't fixable with Lightroom though.  It can also be used to add effects because it is predictable which I'm going to consider a plus :)Overall great lens to have especially if your in an instance you don't want to risk expensive glass just know that you can't skimp too much on proper technique.""

"20100914","5.0","Amazing for the price","Simply put, this is an amazing portrait lens for the price. You just can't beat it. It is a bit slow to focus in low light or if you are in very close. However, if your subject matter is reasonably well behaved, you won't have a problem. If you are going to be photographing kids and don't mind spending a bit more, get a USM lens.""
"20100914","5.0","A must have for the amatuers tool kit.","This lens is great, albeit somewhat unforgiving. It is a must-have for your tool kit.

"20100913","5.0","Awesome lens, great price","If you're sitting on the fence for getting it, do it! It's an awesome lens, period, even better at this price. The build quality isn't as solid as a full metal body, but if you take care of your lenses this won't matter, and it makes it light.""
"20100913","5.0","Love My Nifty Fifty!","This lens lives on my Canon Rebel xs and produces incredible photos. I'm so happy that I was able to buy a prime lens now rather than have to wait and save up for one. Which is what would have happened if it weren't for the 1.8. You can tell it's not going to stand up to much abuse so I'll do my best to protect it and hope that it stands up to regular use, as it really is an amazing lens. Luckily $90 isn't so much money that I'll be heartbroken if it only lasts a couple years. Love it!""
"20100911","5.0","The Nifty Fifty","I cannot say how many thousands of outdoor portraits I took with this lens. If you have a cloudy day and a pretty park, get your senior dolled up and take his/her pictures with this lens.It is a fantastic low light lens, but it also really shines in diffuse daylight. You can open 'er up and shoot fast, and get a bokeh that will make the yearbook staff think you spent a fortune. Or you can stop it down for just a little background blur, and get the sharpest images per dollar you ever imagined.If anyone tells you pros don't use this cheap plastic piece of garbage, I'm here to tell you I have literally hundreds of happy customers, who had no idea what I was shooting with. They just liked the results and recommended me to their friends.The most important component of any camera is the 12 inches behind the viewfinder, so if you can make a good image, you can make a good image with this lens.I have sold mine on, because I made enough with my 'hobby' to shell out for the magic 8 ball (the L 50mm f/1.2). Now, that is an addictive low-light lens. But if you're looking at this lens you are not shopping that one--yet.I cannot recommend this lens highly enough for the shooter just starting to explore new glass. If you have talent and love of images, you will find uses for this lens everywhere, and by the time you break it (it's rather fragile), you'll be ready to move on to the big Sigma 50 or the fantastic f/1.4 50 from Canon--or even the magic 8 ball.This is a great lens, because of its price.

"20100830","5.0","Ridiculously good deal for the non-professional","After reading several of the excellent user reviews here on Amazon.com, I decided to take the plunge and get this lens. Speaking of which, a HUGE THANK YOU to everyone who wrote a review, both favorably and not of the item. I figured for $100 it can't be that big of a let down if it's not too great, right?All I can say is WOW. I have a Canon Rebel T2i/550D with the 18-55mm IS kit lens. I then purchased this lens and the 55-250 mm IS telephoto zoom lens (it arrives today). This 50 mm f/1.8 II has met and exceeded all of my expectations for the lens.Yes, the AF motor is a little noisy. Yes, the switch between AF/MF is a little stiff, which might be considered a good thing for some photographers. The manual focus ring is somewhat oddly placed at first, but after a few days of use I've quickly gotten used to it.This really is an excellent camera for bokeh. Need a shallow depth of field but on a budget? LOOK NO FURTHER.Trust me, you won't feel bad about getting this lens over the f/1.4 USM lens that's over 3 times the price. I would only recommend skipping this lens and getting the more expensive f/1.4 if you think that's a lens you will want one day. In other words, just save your money and get the more expensive one if you're a professional photographer, not on a budget, or must have the best and most expensive.If you're like me and you're an avid novice photographer that just wants people to say, 'wow, those are great pics' and not trying to make money off it, seriously, just BUY THIS LENS. Skip the 'add to wishlist' part, just buy it.At $100, this might be one of the best regular price (i.e. non sale price) deals I've ever gotten. EVER. I haven't snapped any pics with my 18-55mm IS kit lens since I got this 50 mm. And by non-sale price I mean Canon has this lens listed at $99 and it's sold for about that price usually. Many of the Canon EF lenses on Amazon are discounted compared to the MSRP, but this lens sells right about MSRP most of the time.""

The lens itself produces incredible detail, fast response and a smooth depth of vision when f-stop is stepped.For the money, there is no comparison.  I considered the f1.4, but with all the reviews of a weak AF motor, I thought I'd pass.  The f1.2 was never seriously in for consideration due to the price.  Maybe one day, but at this point its hard to pass up such a value for the money.""

"20100818","5.0","Been wanting a 50mm prime for a while.","I have been wanting to buy a 50mm prime for quite some time. Decided to go for this one due to the price and having not used a fixed lens since my high school photography class. I figured if I didn't like it I wouldn't be out too much money. Also, its hard to research this lens without finding a TON of happy owners.  I'm now one of them. This lens is perfect for me. I can already get higher quality shots than any of my previous lenses. Ill have to get used to the techniques involved for framing and whatnot since there is no zoom. Its tiny, light and takes great shots.This really is an extremely cheaply built lens but we all knew that when we ordered. I'm sure it will last long enough for me to save the cash for the 1.4 though. Ill just be keeping in mind its fragility when I use it.Some people have reported this one getting stuck on their camera. Mine goes on and comes off fine. I imagine the ones that got stuck may have been defective or something. Motor is loud and doesn't seem to focus very well (or fast) in many situations. My intentions were to generally do manual focusing so I'm not too broken up about that.Overall I expected great photos and so-so build quality with quite limited features. I got what I expected and I'm happy.  When I get my 1.4 Ill still be keeping this one around for potentially dangerous shoots where I would want high quality images without risking a $300+ lens.""

"20100808","5.0","Great pictures at an affordable price","This is the newest lens that I've purchased for my Canon T1i and my first prime lens. I'm still a photography newbie, but this lens is simple enough even for me to use. I was hesitant to purchase a prime lens, as I'm used to having a lens I can zoom in and out with. However, this lens works great and completely resolved my worries. It gives INCREDIBLY sharp pictures and the colors are great. If you need to zoom, remember you still can and get some exercise at the same time! Just walk towards or away from your subject to frame the picture perfectly. The only downside is the build quality as others have mentioned. However, I don't plan on mistreating my lenses, so I don't think is that big of a problem. I can't believe that I got such a great lens for so cheap. If you're new to photography and looking to get your first prime lens, this is a great option.

"20100731","5.0","50mm Lens Surprisingly Great in the Right Situations","I received this lens 'stock' when I bought my Canon Rebel xTi (400D) off of a dude on Craigslist. He included a flare guard and a UV filter.  At first I had no idea what i was doing with the thing. my initial reaction to a nonzoom lens was THIS IS STUPID WHY DO THEY MAKE SUCH THINGS. I hated that I had to move super far away from my subject matter and that I could get wider shots. As I got used to it, I found out the secret awesome to a no-zoom lens.-INTENSE depth of field: details get nailed with correct focusI am very into getting a super focus on my subject, and this lens allows for a huge difference between the subject and everything else. Finding the correct way to focus took a few weeks, but once I figured it out I felt like all my photographs were some sort of brilliant breakthrough. It's invigorating to have the huge amount of detail from a lower end DSLR. My school had 5Ds for rental, and I feared I would take ages to own that type of hardware after graduating. The quality of shooting is extremely satisfying, as long as you know what you are shooting for. Until you can afford a macro lens, go with this guy.-capturing live music events can happenAs a band photographer and concert goer, I have played with different types of cameras and (if applicable) lens. The lowlight situations were a biatch when I didn't have a large flash and didn't want to distract the performers. This lens rocks at freezing singers in their tracks. Once you find your perch you're good for the rest of the night. You have to be a little closer than you think you need to be.I would not use this lens when shooting people in close quarters. you have to get quite a distance away if you want to have anything show up around your subject. It's a handy lens to have while sightseeing, especially for monuments. If you're in a museum that allows photography, I would not use it because of needing to be far from the subject -- you'd be pretty interrupting to the other museum-goers. The auto-focus can be pretty janky at times which can be a bummer when you want a quick snapshot. Be prepared to do all manual focusing; it creates the best shots with this lens.This lens is good for a beginner photographer in the land of DSLR because it makes you learn how to use your camera rather than letting you get away with pretending you know what you're doing. :P""
"20100731","5.0","Great portrait lens","This lens has a decent build quality, sufficient if you plan to hold it in your camera bag. The huge advantages over the zoom lens are:1) The weight - it weights nothing, very light, especially for entry level DSLRs2) The price - near one hundred bucks price tag makes it a great deal3) The low light performance and shallow depth of field - no zoom has 1.8f aperture. You can blur the background much better than with zooms and shoot nice portraits. I compared it, for example with kit lens, which is not even mile close. It still can take pictures without flash when my $1000+ zoom can't.Some cons, although nothing critical:1) The sharpness at f/1.8 is not that great for portraits, but improves significantly at f/2.2) The lack of image stabilizer makes it difficult to shoot at slow shutter speeds without tripod.3) The manual focus ring is too narrow, though perfectly usable4) The lens is 50mm, which is perfect for portraits and people shooting when on full film size sensor, but on cropped sensor, like most of the DSLRs have today, it's 1.6x50=80mm. With this focus length, it's difficult to shoot full body portraits inside, there must be enough distance to the object. Outside it is less critical, but still noticeable. When I use the zoom lens, I often set it to about 35mm for full body portrait.Overall it's a good buy and great value for money. I recommend it, but not as a single lens.""

Looking at all the sample images and comments finally pushed me over the edge and I am glad they did.This little gem has been giving me clearer pictures than I have been able to achieve for the most part since getting my XSi camera early December 2009. I am even able to do some very nice quazi macro work until I get a real macro lens, and the bokeh is really beautiful. Taking portrait shots of people, well I just can't say enough good things about that.This is going to keep me entertained until I can afford to buy more expensive glass, but hey, I live in California, and work for the state.

"20100725","4.0","You get what you pay for","You get what you pay for and you don't pay much for this lens, however, what you get for the price is surprising.  If you can get past the cheap build quality you'll be pleased to find that this lens takes excellent quality photos.  Shooting wide open (at f/1.8) gives you a wonderful blurred background and it's easy to achieve your depth of field goals with this little beauty.  That said, I do find the auto focus to be a bit temperamental at times and do sometimes miss a shot having to refocus the lens.  This wouldn't have been enough to deter me from the purchase though.  For just under a hundred bucks it really is worth any little quirks and it lets you try out the feel of a prime lens without having to fork out the nearly five hundred dollars for the 50mm 1.4.Overall, very pleased and I think this lens is a steal.""

"20100723","5.0","50mm 1.8 should be in your bag","I got this lens because it's inexpensive. I have been pleasantly surprised. It is sharp, fast, and you can do great things with the DOF (depth of field). You need to stop up to F/2.8 - F/8 . . maybe even F/16 to get the best results. Some of my best shots have come with this lens. Everybody should have one unless you can afford the 1.4 which is 4-5X as much and not really worth it IMO. The manual focus is horrible but works fine. The lens feels like a toy, but again, it works fine. In fact, better than fine. It works great. You can also keep it if you upgrade to a full frame some day. Get the damn lens. It rules and it's one of the most inexpensive lenses out there.Update after about 9 months : I am still using the lens and it's still performing fine. The image quality has been a big surprise. It has some fringing problems at the lower apertures but for the price it's got to be in your bag. I have taken some of my best portraits with the 50mm 1.8 It's really good for people. It's equally as good for still life and abstract which I love both. It has been my best investment. I have VERY expensive lenses like the 17-55 F/2.8 and 24-105 F/4L the 100mm F/2.8 and still use this lens quite a bit. Highly recommended.""

I didn't realize it until I found many of my photos taken through this lens were out of focus.In the beginning I blamed myself because I just had my first DSLR not long ago and I am still learning how to take good photos. Out of the curiosity, I set my camera with this lens on a tripod and pointed 45 degree down at a newspaper page. First I auto focused on a middle line of the paper. Once it is focused, I switched to manual focus and brought live view up with 10x magnification. Visually examining the focus point I found the focus was slightly down to the next line (closer to the camera).So I contacted Canon for a warranty repair. A week later, Canon had it fixed and returned it to me. The service paper said the lens' electronic circuit had an error and caused front focusing. They ran electronic adjustment and now it focuses right on the money.""

After reading these many wonderful reviews, I decided to buy it (and at about $100 it isn't exactly a budget killing investment) and was absolutely impressed by the image quality of the lens on my T1i. I haven't used any of canon's other offerings in the 50mm primes, so I can't say much about it's quality relative to any of those, but I am extremely pleased with it and use it every chance I get.A few downsides: the sound of the AF motor can be distracting, but that's part of the reason for its affordable price. That, and the completely plastic body, which does make me a little wary about accidently dropping it onto any sort of hard surface (though it wouldn't be difficult to replace). Also, the cropped sensor of my T1i can make this lens challenging to use in small rooms and other tight places. I'm looking at canon's offerings in the 24 to 35mm prime area to see if I can't find a nice lens to get me closer to a 50mm perspective on my T1i.""

I was holding out to buy the 50mm F1.4 at 3 1/2 times the price, then decided I would buy 50mm F1.8 to see what a diffence that aperture would make. I'm sold I'll keep the nifty until I wear it out, then buy the F1.4, or 1.2 if I can afford it. If you have never used a fast lens, this is a great introduction and well worth the small price.""

"20100704","4.0","Price to Quality Ratio is Unmatched","I was really excited to review this lens and tell the rest of the world about. Then I realized that 1000+ had the same idea already. I don't think I can say anything about this lens that has not already been said, but I hope I can add value to your search.I'm relatively new to the DSLR arena, so I only own this lens and the Kit 18-55 that came with my T2i. Of the two, this one is my go to lens, and I only use the other one when I want to go wider than 50mm. At 80mm on my T2i's cropped sensor, this is my portrait lens.This lens is so hard to pass up because of the price. After spending close to $1,000 on a camera, $99 is a drop in the bucket. Having only the kit lens as my other lens, I really like having a lens that can open up to f/1.8 for low light situations. Although, I should point out that the images can be really soft when it is that wide open. Funny enough, as I learn this lens, I try to stay away from 1.8 if I can, preferring to stay around f/2.8 or f/2.2 when I want a shallow depth of field.This lens does have some auto focus issues sometimes, mostly in low light (ironic, considering f/1.8 is perfect for low light). You'll keep getting the can't focus beep as it hunts for the focus point. It is so bad that until I got use to it, I started to think something was wrong with the lens or my camera. The other times it can give you focusing issues is when you are doing close ups (i.e. macros). It's nearest distance to focus is .45 meters or 1.5 feet. It will definitely let you know when you are too close.I have noticed some ghosting effects on some pictures of my son. He is an active 6 month old, so this is mainly due to his movements in a low light situation. I also hate flash and try to get away with ISO 800 or less in an indoor situation. I'll bump up the ISO to see if that solves the ghosting.As a walk around lens I love the pictures made with this lens. They are sharp and the color is very accurate. Given the two issues I pointed out, you would think I would not give it Four Stars. However, the price gives it the extra star. Advance amateurs like me will be quite happy with this lens.""

Don't be fooled at its size, lightness, or underwhelming price. You will be blown away by the superb quality optics! Delicious colors, creamy backgrounds, closeups that will knock your socks off, all in a tiny plastic package cheaper than almost any other lens out there.Beware, though, that there is a learning curve with this lens. I was very frustrated with it at first. I couldn't figure out exactly how to make this lens shine. It's best for subjects that aren't moving fast, and are indoors or in subdued outdoor light. Nailing down the razor-thin focus can be tricky - I still have problems accidentally catching the surface my subject sits on rather than the subject itself. But when you hit that sweet spot, you'll be so grateful you gave this lens a chance.The 50mm 'plastic fantastic' has gotten me hooked on prime lenses, and I can't wait to buy more. Out of all the other lenses in my bag, none of which are fixed focal length, this little beauty is by far the best in picture quality. I think next I'll try a 35mm, because as much as I love my 50mm, I don't get it out as often as I should, since in limited space you can't back up far enough to get your subject in the frame.

Instead of spending hundreds more into a much better prime lens (or zoom for that matter) that has wider aperture and pro quality, this lens could give the option of low light photography and a chance to get-used-to with such low light environments.The experience with this lens will then enable the person to get educated enough in deciding which pro lens to buy for night photography and also what type of things to look for in such a lens.At this price with all these benefits, I think this is worth it for someone attempting to venture into such a photographic world.

In situations where a 5.6f-stop would require a shutter speed of 25/1000 or 30/1000 the 1.8f-stop allows a 160/1000 or 200/1000 shutter speed. the fixed 50mm is a really good multi-use length. You can get close to a subject and take a nice macro shot with a beautiful bokeh, or you can stand back and take a nice full shot of the subject. its not too wide or too narrow, just perfect.

The IQ is still pretty sharp wide open at f/1.8 but i think f/2.8 is sharper. The quality build is not so great and it feels very light in the hands like a fragile toy.  The AF motor is pretty loud. However, this doesnt bother me, but it may annoy someone who is used to a USM. i highly recommend this to all amateurs and even experienced photographers for the great image results at a versatile focal length of 50mm! This is on my Canon T2i more than any of my other lens.  I've owned it for about 1 month and taken a few thousand shots. This is actually one of my favorite lens.  I've read another review that this lens wears easily and breaks.  If that is the case, i will repost my review and give an update after mine breaks from short lived 'wear and tear'.  It may be worth it to purchase the more expensive 50mm lens by Canon if this model wears easily.  For now, this lens is well worth the money spent.""
"20100605","5.0","Newbie Happiness","The Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II is my first dive into DSLR lens heaven. As a brand new photographer, I really have no idea what to expect when I try new things. This has done everything I wanted it to do, and mostly things I didn't know I wanted it to do, but did anyway.I really appreciate that it's lightweight and cheap. Even if it does feel like it was manufactured by Mattel, it takes pictures like you would expect from a great brand like Canon.I HIGHLY suggest this lens for ALL beginners. It's easy to use, and the pictures come out looking like you know what you're doing. Even if you don't. =)""

"20100528","5.0","Like a toy, but man is it sharp.","I've had this for a day or two and snapped some pics and was extremely impressed with the IQ on my XSi.  All the reviews are correct that this is a very sharp lens.  I'm sure it'll take some nice action shots and portraits of the kid.  At f/1.8 it does soak up the light too.I compared it to 50mm on my Canon 17-85mm and to 70mm on my Canon 70-300mm and it is way sharper.  I know that's not scientific and I just used the LCD to view the pics, but it's pretty obvious this thing has some nice optics.It does look and feel like a toy, but I knew that and no loss of points for that.  It's so tiny and all plastic'y, but I will use my kid gloves with it.  If you are curious, just buy it.  If I were going to use this thing a lot and not be too careful, I'd probably splurge for the 50mm f/1.4 since it's more rugged with a metal mount, but for the price of this one, as someone said, I could buy 4 of these for the price of the f/1.4.""

Very good pics (I take a lot of pics of children in motion and thus I need the flash to compensate for the tight shutter speed and aperture) but nearly always require some post-shoot tweaking. Not with this lens. Holy moly it gives beautiful shots! in low light! with realistic DoF!I can't crow enough about this lens. I only wish they made it with metal housing. Plastic is lighter but I'm terrified to drop it.""
"20100518","5.0","Great Buy!","First,this is not a L series telephoto lens, but it is a fantastic prime lens for about $100!!! The construction is not real sturdy, and has a lot of plastic but for the money it is insanely great. Pictures are CRYSTAL clear and sharp. This is a great way to learn the lower f/ stops which is what I totally expected. The f/1.8 is more than enough to give you a ton of experience on what to be watching for. I missed focus on some secondary items in the picture due to setting the f/ stop too low, but that is my point, we need to learn by using a low f/ stop lens and this is a great way to learn. I also found that I will be looking much harder at prime lenses instead of zooms in the future. Without all of the compromises that zooms require, primes can get incredible sharpness! I have a lot of money in lenses, but this is the best bargain in my kit. And Amazon gave its usual great service on this purchase.""

I can't say enough about this lens. I've spoken with many professionals about this lens and while they own the more expensive f/1.2, they also agree this is the best lens for the money. Can't say enough about it. If you're an amateur, looking for a portrait lens, don't think twice, get this lens.""
"20100508","4.0","Great for the price!","As a neophyte in the video DSLR field, this was my first purchase moving away from the kit lens.  It is a very sharp lens, great picture and awesome dof.  Definitely an outstanding purchase for the price and quite frankly don't know why you wouldn't buy this lens if you had any kind of budget at all.  It does feel like a toy, light, cheap plastic...wouldn't want to drop it on the pavement...that is for sure.  But if you did...it less than $100.00, so the heartache is minimized.  I use it more than the kit lens as I think it produces a sharper picture.  Again, if you are starting out, have a budget, can't afford all the cool stuff, this would be your lens!""
"20100508","1.0","this lens will cost you","My mom got this and used it once. She took one single photo and the whole thing exploded while on her camera. Parts of it were stuck on the body and could not be removed. The parts that were not stuck flew off the camera and hit my daughter in the face leaving a really nasty cut and bruise. We sent the camera and what was left of the lens to Canon because none of the local businesses would touch it. They had all seen this before and didn't sound surprised at all but nobody wanted to deal with it. Canon would not cover this under the warranty even though we did nothing wrong and used it in totally normal conditions. It was cheap so no big deal except the lens forced it's way into the cameras mirror box and damaged that and the sensor. Even if they were willing to fix this under the warranty (which they are not) they said there is no way they would fix the camera. They said there was evidence of impact. Impact! The only impact was between the lens and my baby's face when it went flying off the front of the camera! It was taken out of the box, put on the camera and didn't even make it one click. Since it broke on the first use I am going to have to assume it was either damaged before we got it, maybe in shipping or something or it was defective from the very beginning. The people we talked to at Canon said things like 'We never cover the damage this lens causes.' and other things that lead me to believe they are used to this type of problem occurring. To fix the camera would have cost more than buying a new one so this hundred dollar lens ended up costing her much more than that. In short, just get the 50mm f/1.4. I told her this was a throw away lens but she didn't listen. Darn parents never learn!""

"20100419","4.0","Great little lens","I bought this lens because the 18-55 mm and the 55-200mm zoom lenses that came with my canon kit (though great) are not the best for low-light, non-flash situations.  With the low aperture of 1.8 light just POURS through this lens, making shooting indoors a breeze.  The caveat with this feature is the depth of field is very narrow, which makes focusing a little tricky.  On the camera back (and through the viewfinder) the photo would look faboo, but on the computer screen I would discover that the camera focused on the subjects shoulder instead of the face, so there's a little bit of blur going on.  Try manual focus or pay attention to this when using the lens and you'll be fine.""
"20100419","5.0","Sweet Little Lens!","I did lots of research before deciding to purchase this lens and I'm so glad I did. I couldn't believe you could get a decent quality lens for this price, but I've been very pleased with the results. Nice, crisp images.""

"20120320","5.0","Flimsy but takes great photos.","just got this in earlier today and i couldn't be more pleased. now having said that you do really have to keep your expectations in check. this lens costs about as much as a decent tripod, and the reason for that is blatantly obvious once you get it in your hands, its made of plastic. now don't get me wrong the optics perform beautifully, however one wrong move i and expect this to fall apart like a house of cards. but you get what you pay for, and so long as you're not hoping this lens will replace your baseball bat everything should be fine. on the note of the focus motor, I'm not sure i could wake the dead with it but it sure makes a valiant effort. don't expect the noise of it to be absent when filming with auto-focus. luckily for me i don't plan on doing very much filming with it or rather with the internal mic as an audio source. as far as the optics go, its just as good as you're hoping it is, the bokeh is nice and gooey at 1.8 and everything that's in focus is incredibly sharp, great for landscapes, nature sports that kind of thing, kinda unforgiving for portraits. but that's just my 2 cents, as far as i am concerned for the 120 dollars i spent on it i couldn't be happier.""
"20120318","5.0","great lens","omg for the money you can't beat it. Yeah it's plastic but it's great. low aperture to allow alot of light in. when I'm shooting with another lens and I don't want to up the iso or mess with shutter i pop this lens in and it brightens things up. Sharp as a button also. It's not a walk around lens. I've tried it for that and alot of times end up switching for wide angles and what not.

But this lens makes me look like I know what I'm doing!From reading the other, more concise, reviews about this lens I guess I got lucky in the build.  I've had this lens since Sep 2007.  It was my exclusive lens all of 2008 and most of 2009.  It's been knocked around (gently) but still holds up.  Eventually I'll probably have to think about replacing it and will probably do so with the same, instead of the 'better' but more expensive 1.4.  Only because I recently got a 60mm macro lens that I'm having fun with now, giving the 50mm a much needed rest.  (I think.)So, like another reviewer said, if you're on the fence about this photography thing, do not hesitate to buy this lens.  It really does help you take amazing pictures.  p.s. my camera is the Rebel XT.  check out some pics I've uploaded in the customer images gallery.""
"20100416","3.0","An OK lens","A few months ago, I was looking to expand my lens collection.  I chose this lens based upon the price and good reviews.  First the price is hard to beat at under $100.  The pictures taken with this lens are soft wide open, but stop it down a little and they sharpen right up.  The same thing can be said about lenses costing many times more.That said, I'm not a fan of this lens.  The with only 5 aperture blades, boken lights are a weird shape, not that nice round shape I've been looking for.  The autofocus is loud and sounds like it's full of sand.If you're an amateur on a limited budget just starting out, then this is a fine lens.  It's sharp and fast.  For the more advanced amateur I'd consider savings for the 1.4.  And if you have any 'L' series glass, I'd stay away.  You're going to be disappointed.  For me, I just picked up a Canon 24-70L, so I'll be selling my nifty fifty.""
"20100412","5.0","About the best value of any lens","I saw this little lens on Amazon plenty of times and wondered whether it was really as good as people said it was.  After all, it had f/1.8 in all its glory, fantastic reviews, and was selling for $100.  I figured I had to be missing something.  I was:  a fantastic lens.I bought this for a family photo shoot and tried it out for the first time for the shoot.  It was pretty darned good, and I was quite impressed, but it wasn't until I tried it a few more times that I realized what a great little lens it is.  Here's why:- First off, you can't get other any lens with f/1.8 for this cheap, let alone one that performs this well.  I love how much light enters this lens, even in low light.- The colors and contrast are fantastic for the price.  It's not L lens quality, but what do you expect at $100?  But I can say that the colors and contrast are both FAR superior to my Canon 28-135mm zoom, which costs over 4 times as much.- The sharpness is quite good, with a couple caveats which I'll mention later.- The focal length is just about perfect for most portrait photography.  I'm a landscaper almost exclusively, but this lens has increased my interest in portrait photography.- The background blur is remarkable, but not surprising for a lens with such a large max aperture.There are of course a few minor cons:- The main one for me is sharpness at larger apertures.  Anything larger than f/2.8 it's something of a hit or a miss, though I have yet to get a truly blurry picture that wasn't my own fault.  But images are certainly a bit softer at 1.8 and 2.2.- Another issue is the build quality--it's relatively solid, but not strong.  The casing is entirely plastic, which makes it lightweight but somewhat delicate-feeling.- I'm not the biggest fan of the bokeh--I wish it were rounder and less hexagonal.  But for that you'd have to pay for an L lens, so I really can't complain too much.  It's certainly not bad.- One final issue, and this isn't so much an issue with the lens as with the user, is that you have to be very precise when focusing with this thing at larger apertures, because a difference in depth of 6 inches will cause your focal point to not be in focus.  So it takes some getting used to, and some skill to properly focus.  But that's a tribute to the lens' backgrond blur more than it's an issue.To summarize, though it has some issues, I give it 5 stars for its value for the money.  Short of an L lens, I don't know that you could do better for portraits.""
"20100412","5.0","Cheap and Plastic but produces AWESOME pictures!","I bought this lens because I was having trouble getting quality pictures in low light settings... and this was exactly the solution I needed.  The wide aperture draws in more light at a slower shutter speed, picking up details my other, more expensive lenses couldn't capture.

"20100403","5.0","As sharp as it gets","Make no mistake, just because this lens is cheap doesnt mean it's not sharp.

Well in this caseit fell apart. So I've got proof it's not terrible solid. In fact the plastic is glued together.

The quality of the pictures from this lens is outstanding.  I do have two very minor complaints about it but it's only natural since this lens costs less than one month's cable bill.  It is a little on the noisy side and it does search from time to time so I have lost a perfectly candid shot here and there.  Other than that, I am utterly thrilled with the ease of use and quality of images I get to capture.  I take this lens EVERYWHERE with me from weddings, baby/wedding showers and countless birthday celebrations... my friends and colleagues have commented numerously that my pictures look professional & that I should get paid for it part-time.  (I don't think so but to the layman, I suppose they could look like as such.)  I got a hood to block excess light and using an ultraviolet lens cover to preserve this super-fun toy.

On a 5D, the focal length is very useful and it takes sharp pics. I won't often use it wide open, but at f1.8, it's plenty fast. And the price is pretty good, too.The immediate downsides are the 5 blade aperture (pentagon highlights) and lack of a distance scale. I don't know, yet, if the plastic construction wil be an issue for me, though I do not often break things. It will probably work for me.""

Image quality is what makes this lens a true value.  Razor sharp images and a pretty quick lens to boot.  Right now I shoot a Rebel xsi so that means that this lens translates to around an 85mm since the camera is not a full frame.  That makes this an  excellent portrait lens!""
"20100325","5.0","nifty fifty","What can i say. This has got to be the best lens canon makes for this kind of price. The auto focus is always a little off so you may want to get in the practice of learning how to manual focus. I will normally use the AF to get in range and then the MF to get the sharp focus that i need. For the price and the speed that this lens can produce. I dont think this lens can be beat. Though be careful if y ou are putting this on a Crop Sensor. You will find your self about 10 feet away on portrait shots. So if thats what you plan on useing this lens for then make sure you have room.""

Great for portraits and low light conditions.  This lens give out the bokeh that makes your subject stand out in your composition. My only advise is to get a proper bag for your camera to store this lens, that way your $100 investment would lengthen its lifespan.""
"20100322","5.0","Best bang for buck","When I was starting with photography, I had a 35mm Nikon and three lenses, a 35mm, 85mm and 135mm.  Between those three primes (or a similar combination) you could do pretty much everything.  That was a long, long time ago.  Or was it?Now-days, it seems like you need 4 or 5 or 10 lenses to 'cover' everything.  Especially if you read the forums, populated with those who prefer to look at charts and read specs as opposed to get out and shoot with what they have.  With all these megapixels at our disposal, what's going on?For many this 50mm 1.8 will be their first prime.  They got an entry-level digital camera and it probably came with a kit lens, probably a variable aperture zoom.  They got a bit into it and decided to upgrade to a zoom with a fixed 2.8, the mythical f/2.8 that allows them to shoot in the dark.Then they started getting more into it, what else is there in digital photography that I'm missing?  Why are these people's photos on the web (flickr, smugmug, whatever) so much more saturated and sharp?  How can I get that level of detail in my photos?  Sooner or later the stumble on the mention of primes.. primes vs zooms.. maybe they read about Leicas.. and they start to question if they really know what they're doing, maybe there's a solution with a better lens yet??And so the hunt starts.. some photographers will find their happy place and others will forever chase technology.There's not much I can add after 100s of other reviews.  This lens is a fabulous little gem from Canon.  The stories about it' sharpness and colors are true.  Let me discuss some of the downsides, and how they play out in practical use.FYI, I've paired this lens up with various bodies, including 20D, 40D, 5D, and a 1D Mark II-N.  It performs well on all.Build Quality: Plastic.  Not sealed.  Rattles a bit.  Loud focusing.  I see none of these as a negative.  They are commensurate with the price point and are honestly quite reliable.  I've used this lens at dozens of weddings, photojournalism assigments, etc.  I've had it caked in sand and salt water with no issues.  Would I bring a $350 1.4 or a $1200 1.2 into those conditions?  Definitely not.  I like having something near-disposable that I can abuse.Related to build quality, this thing is light as a feather.  If you're hiking, climbing, traveling.. pair it up with a newer Rebel T1i or T2i, and you have an awesome little package for stills and video that weighs next to nothing.  Beats the hell out of humping a couple bricks (e.g. 24-70 2.8 on a 40D) for a 3-day hike.  It'll be a bit long in the focal range, but I've never complained.Focusing: It's not USM, so it's not super fast.  But there are ways to make it faster.  For one, manually designating your AF point speeds AF dramatically.  This is true on any lens, from a $90 50mm to a $4500 300mm.  For two, pay attention and anticipate.  Having your lens pre-focused in an area where you suspect something to happen is going to decrease search time by 50%.  Finally, know how your AF works and get your AF point over a high contrast step.  There's a theme here... it's the photographer, not the camera/lens, that makes it happen.  You do your part, and the equipment will do it's part.I do have a gripe about the focus ring.  This is one aspect of the lens that is really lacking.  I'd gladly pay an extra $15-20 for a decent rubberized ring with slightly smoother action.  But, it is what it is.It's also clumsy to attach the hood to this thing, with the adapter piece.  But honestly it looks so silly I usually leave it off.  Haven't noticed any ill-effects from lens flare, just don't shoot into the sun or use your hand.If you've never used a prime, pick this up.  Stocking stuffer for yourself.""

"20100313","3.0","Good Lens For Money - Inconsistently Sharp Images","I bought this 50mm f/1.8 lens last year to get pictures of our newborn in low light. This was my first digital SLR (XSi) and first lens purchase. I saw all of the reviews and thought it was a no-brainer for the price. Initially I thought the pictures looked great, but then I really started getting into taking pictures and editing them. I notice that the images were inconsistently sharp. Being new I thought maybe the inconstancies were due to camera shake, but after several tests I realized that it was not. I sent the lens back to Canon just to make sure that there was nothing wrong with it. They said that everything was working according to the specs.After getting frustrated with the soft images I decided to buy the 50mm f/1.4 lens. After receiving the 50mm f/1.4 lens all of my pictures are consistently sharp. I did several tests with the same settings using both lenses and about 60% of the f/1.8 images were not sharp, but 98% of the f/1.4 were tack sharp. If you have the money I would definitely recommend the 50mm 1.4 lens. I still think that this f/1.8 is a bargain for the money.""
"20100312","5.0","Quality optics, cheap plastic construction","I bought this lens for my canon rebel xsi after reading hundreds of reviews praising it. Well, the masses were correct! This is an excellent lens. The image quality is outstanding and far better than I can get from the 18-55mm IS kit lens that came with the camera. It's great in low light and creates pretty good bokeh. The only downsides are the slow auto-focus and cheap plastic feel, but at this price point you can't beat it. It's a little long on my crop sensor camera, so I find myself using it mostly for taking portraits or head shots of people. I'll probably add a 24mm f/2.8 prime in the near future as my walk around lens. If you have the extra money, then buy it. Highly recommended.""

I give this lens 4 stars more because of the auto focus than because of the plastic body.  I just don't think it focuses to suit me, but that's easily rectified by switching to manual mode.  It still does a good job, I guess I just expected more based on the reviews I read.  Would buy again...a thousand times over.""
"20100310","5.0","Freakin awesome 50mm","So when I got my XS I read that I should skip the kit lens and just get a cheap body and this 50mm. This lens did not disappoint. At first I thought it sucked because I didn't know how to use it and was using autofocus, for really good stills use that digital zoom button to get stuff far away in clear focus, its surprising how much detail you can get in your pictures. Sucks that I can't zoom in or out but I would rather have clear pictures and run around all the time than be frustrated trying to get a good quality picture with a zoom lens. Lots of people say the construction for this sucks, but what the heck do they expect from a plastic lens? its obviously built to be lighter and not weigh down your camera, besides if you drop your camera you're and idiot, thats why these things have neck straps, but i could see how a kid could grab a hold of it and slam it on the ground (this wold probably not survive) regardless its a great deal for 100 bucks, its inexpensive because its plastic, manual focus seems loose, autofocus is snappy and makes a really cool mechanical sound, 1.8 aperture at this price is an insane deal and i really don't care with any of the little faults on this lens, it takes great pictures and motivates me to move around and find more dynamic angles for taking pictures by forcing me to move around to get closer/further from subjects""

"20100303","4.0","Good in daylight, use a hood to reduce flaring","There is a reason this lens has more than a thousand reviews, and a very high rating. It is an excellent value.The good: I bought this with my new T2i to have a 'fast' lens to learn with. As an amateur, I wasn't sure what I was going to learn, but the reviews here encouraged me. I shot some hand held shots on my way home by train, bike, and on foot; the clarity and brightness are spectacular. Now 'I get it'. I have already learned a lot using this lens, for example, like the rank amateur I am, I thought the camera had failed to focus some of the frame, because I'm used to a P&S where everything is focused.. Now 'I get it'.. that a shallow depth of field makes the image look 3 dimensional. It's awesome.I am looking forward to learning about how f/ stops affect DOF, and other techniques which right now I 'don't know that I don't know!' Yeah, the lens is plastic; but short of dropping it, I think it will last. Amazing that this is a Canon branded lens at this low price. Buy one, and do your Canon shooting friends a favor and get them to buy one as well.The bad:I looked more closely at my night shots after the excitement had cooled. Many of them have serious ghosting and refraction artifacts! Any time there is a point light source in the field of view, the lens ghosts. Get a hood to reduce this flaring.The auto focus is good, not great. The fact you can get an AF lens for less than $100 is amazing. Sure, its not USM (ultra sonic), but it works.The manual focus ring is thin; I would call it 'vestigal'. I wish Canon would have made it twice as thick in the knurled ring area; but then, most people will never use manual focus. I do for video.Overall, if you own an EOS, you should have this lens (or the f/1.4 version)""
"20100303","5.0","Much better pictures than you'd expect","When you see a lens with a plastic mount and a price this low, the natural response is to assume it's a piece of junk.  But, to my pleasant surprise, this little lens has produced some shots that rival my favorite L (pro series) lens.  It's great for portraits, especially if you're shooting with a full-frame body.  On a 1.6 crop camera (i.e., a Rebel), you might find that you need to be farther from your subject than you'd like, but as explained below that isn't really a problem.One of the biggest advantages of this lens is the f/1.8 aperture.  It doesn't sound quite as impressive as the more expensive 50mm 1.4, but it's definitely enough for almost any situation.  It allows you to get really nice bokeh even when shooting a portrait on a 1.6 crop factor body, with a greater distance from the glass to the subject.  What's supposed to be sharp is sharp, and the blur is perfect.  I actually think, with the right lighting of course, taking a portrait at f/1.8 or f/2 on a crop body creates the ideal balance.  On a full-frame body, you'd want to stop down a little to get a crisper, sharper portrait given the closeness of the subject to the lens.Of course the aperture also makes it a great low-light performer, but if you're not experienced with camera equipment than know this -- opening the aperture to 1.8 (or anywhere below 3, really) will give you less depth of field than you probably want in average picture taking scenarios.  For example, if you're just taking candid pictures of people at a family gathering, or if you're doing a group shot with a large number of people, you don't want to sacrifice focus for the sake of getting a low-light shot.  That being said, I've been able to hand my camera to inexperienced shooters at family gatherings on full auto with this lens and they've gotten some pretty impressive shots.  Focuses fast and accurately, and nails the aperture and exposure time.All in all, as long as a) you've got some experience with lenses or b) you'll follow the advice to not shoot at super-wide aperture unless it's the right situation for it, anyone with a Canon DSLR should really enjoy this lens.""

Here are some points to consider if you are thinking about this lens.It's cheap: The build quality is pretty bad. It feels like it's made entirely of plastic. It makes awful noises when it auto-focuses. The manual focus has no resistance. I don't think Canon makes a poorer lens when it comes to quality.But, this lens has so many redeeming qualities that it doesn't matter:It's Sharp: Stop down to f/2.2 or f/2.8 and this thing takes fantastic photos. They are SHARP. Very sharp. In fact, it takes images on par with several of my L series lenses.It's cheap: even if you break the thing, you can probably afford to buy a new one. I've had mine for about four months and I haven't had any issues.It's small: and light. This thing is tiny and makes a DSLR feel like a P&S (well, not really... but almost)It's fun: shooting with a prime lens is fun. No longer do you have the luxury of zooming in and out so you have to move around. It's also fun to be able to open up to f/1.8 and get some intense Depth of Field.I recommend this lens to everyone I've ever talked to about photography. It's a must have.""

"20100205","5.0","How can such an economy lense perform so well?","I am new to photography and have a XSI with kit lens that didn't take pictures any better than my Canon 'sureshot'. After that disappointment I thought maybe a new lens would help.After careful review of the Canon F1.8 and F1.4 (didn't consider the expensive F1.2) I selected the F1.8. After I recievd it I took 8 or ten pictures and they were much better than I expected. So I said to myself 'wow the F1.4 must be better yet' so I immediatly ordered it. Within in a few days I had both lenses in my hands and started a picture comparison 'smack down'. At this point I have taken indoor, outdoor, close-up, far away, bright light, low light, portraits, dogs, dolls, books, etc. I have used different ISO, different F stop, different shutter speeds. I run side by side comparisons on my 24' monitor -- zoom in and out, match colors and edges, look at depth of field, and of course 'bokeh' (background blurring). For the most part I used the same set of subjects on the same day for each lense.My conclusion is that the F1.8 is equal to the F1.4 in overall picture taking ability -- many are sharper and colors are as good. Under some circumstances the F1.4 is better such as indoor low light but the difference is not obvious until it is enlarged. I think the F1.8 is  slightly better outdoors in bright light. Overall I think it is a push. I should point out that they are both better than the kit lens -- other than the variable focal length with better wide angle (F18 - F55).However the F1.8 sounds a little clunky when it focuses and it is obviously more cheaply made than the F1.4. The F1.4 looks better on the camera and feels better, the focus motor sounds more solid, and in general is a better lens.If they both cost the same I would take the F1.4 seven days a week. But given the significant price difference the F1.8 is hard to resist.""
"20100205","5.0","Nothing can compare at this price!","This lens is truly amazing! The image quality is so good, there is no issue with attaching it to a 1D. I like everything about the lens and don't bother with a filter for protection since the price means replacing it is not an issue. Focus speed is reasonable but not as quick as it could be. In low light however, it is as fast or faster than most L series lenses due to the f1.8 maximum aperture. The construction is not as robust as i would like, but for this price i cannot complain. If you own a Canon DSLR or SLR i would get this lens without hesitation. It will allow you to understand the capabilities of whatever body you are using for a minimal price.""

It got a lot of bad reviews, but for the price, you can't go wrong.  I recommend it.""
"20100204","5.0","Best Hundred Dollars I've Spent","I recommend this lens hands down.  I'm an aspiring amateur photographer, and after reading a bunch of great reviews on this lens I bought it to complement my sigma 28-70mm lens, which is ok as a walkaround lens, but I wanted something different.  I needed something so that when my friends are over, we can be hanging out in near darkness sometimes and I can snap pictures of everything.  Also, I'm into portrait photography, so this seemed to match my needs.It has pretty much exceeded my expectations, and has taken my photography to another level.  Wide open, this lens allows me to take pictures indoors, at ISO 400-800 and 1/50 second shutter speed.  Which is pretty much what you need to make sure the picture's not shaking like you had too much coffee.  Anyway, this little black piece of plastic pretty much has never left my 450D since I bought it.  In daytime this lens shines even more.  You drop the aperture down to about f5 or so, and you'll get ridiculously sharp pictures.  I took a picture of my friend, and you can easily see the pores on his face.  The colors are very cool too, and I think it captured the colors alot better than my sigma lens does.I've seen a lot of people complaining about the quality of the lens.  Ok, I will be the first to admit that I'm not running around chasing lions in Africa or providing photo coverage of the war in Iraq.  I'm just a dude with a camera, and I tend to be in relatively safe/sand free situations.  I'm sure if I drop it, it will probably shatter into seventeen pieces, which is fine because the lens never leaves my camera, and the camera never leaves my neck when I'm shooting.  Besides people, this is a hundred dollar lens.  You just can't expect the build quality that 200 dollars difference makes.  If you want to go climb trees to take pictures of orangutans, you'll probably want something a little more solid or weatherproof.  But if you're like me and keep your camera safe/dry, the build quality shouln't be too much of a problem.Overall, I think this lens is one of the best values in all of photography, hands down.  I'll post some sample pictures when I feel like it.""

"20100131","1.0","My lens is unacceptable wide open","I am a professional cinematographer,and have owned several lens over the years.  I don't get the positive reviews, my lens is soft wide open and down a stop too, at which point I might as well use my zoom lens and not risk dust on the sensor by taking the lens off.  To me this lens is junk.  I have shot over 3000 time lapse sequences with DSLR cameras, love the Canon DSLR cameras, just plan to sell the 50mm off soon.  Some people may have received a better copy.  But when I shoot city lights from my house overlooking a city, this lens has been the worst I have ever used.  I make a living shooting beautiful images for stock footage, sometimes with quite cheap glass, so I was sad to see the results.I shoot quite a bit at night in moonlit landscapes, so I understand fast lens shot falls, but this lens was terrible.  I also only manually focus everything, I use a hoodman loupe for all shots, to check focus, I nail focus better then using auto focus on every lens I own.  So no auto focus issue, just poor glass.I don't mean to upset anyone who may like the lens, just my professional two cents.""

I'm using it on my Canon XSi (450D) body. The pictures are amazing, especially portraits and low light shots when the subject is moving. The only downside I see is that the Mark II current version has a plastic mount, vs. Mark I's metal, and this lens will not permanently stay on the camera. But for the price, I can't complain much!""
"20100129","5.0","Great lens for the cost, excellent picture quality","This lens is a must-have for anyone who wants to take decent DSLR pictures. Some people have complained about shoddy construction or materials, but like any other piece of expensive electronics, if you take care of it, it will last. The pictures I've taken with this lens are incredibly better than ones with my stock lens, or even my 75-200mm F4. Obviously the ability to zoom is lost, but for most situations, the lens is more than enough to take great pictures. The best quality is the ability to take pictures in very low-light conditions, without using flash, getting clear, visible shots of dimly lit subjects. Everyone who's used a camera knows the implications of using the built-in flash (too much lighting, subject being too close, shadows, etc.) but turning off the flash and using this lens for even that one spectacular shot will make you feel like you got your money's worth.Even though I'm still an amateur photographer myself, I can already tell that many people's complaints on equipment seem to be rooted in the fact that they don't understand the balance between aperature, ISO setting, shutter speed, and white balance.This lens stays on my camera all the time unless I absolutely need to take that zoom shot, as infrequent as that is. It severely cut down on the number of lenses I feel I need to carry around with me, and since it is so lightweight, it makes shooting even easier.I'd recommend this to any aspiring photographer. Although the F1.4 version of the same lens would likely provide even more extraordinary shots, the extra cost for .4 doesn't seem like a reasonable justification in my opinion, unless one has the money to spend on the best of everything.""
"20100126","5.0","Exactly what I wanted","This lens is exactly as it is advertised. You can hardly take a bad picture. I have shot many pictures in low light with sub-optimal conditions and 9x out of 10, the image is precisely what I wanted or better. Very happy.""
"20100123","5.0","Very crisp clear lens","Hi, I bought this lens few weeks back and I am loving its awesome results. I specially like the crisp clarity of every image. We can easily get bokeh effect using this lens. It has 5 blades so you will get pentagonal bokehs. If you are using this lens on cropped sensor camera, it will act as 80mm prime lens. so it will be mid telephoto lens. But I found a very nice technique to make this 35mm lens on cropped sensor camera also by just spending around $35. Here is what you need to achieve this. 1 step up ring (52mm to 58mm -$3 max) and Opteka HD Wide Angle Lens($30-G9 model). I used it for many indoor shots and  getting same awesome crisp clear shots. no need to spend fortune on wide-angle lenses. This lens is also best for portrait shots. I will soon upload few pics 50mm and 35mm ones on my blog and add link to this review.Thanks a lot for reading.. Just go for this lens.. and get thrilled by its quality. i give 100/100 marks to this lens.""

Yes, there are much better lenses on the market, but this is a great lens for the money and she is just using it for pics of our two girls.  If she was going to be shooting professional photography we probably would have opted for the 50mm that is a step up ($300+.)

It is a bit noisy and feels cheaply put together, but don't let that stop you from getting this lens. You will not be disappointed. How can you beat a great lens for under a $100.""
"20100115","5.0","Amazing if you know how to use it","I got this lens when I ordered my Canon Rebel T1i. I have never taken a photography class, so I am kind of self taught, but I love it.Anyway...When I first got this lens, I thought I had wasted a hundred bucks. No zoom, short little lens, and if you don't focus perfectly, it is super blurry.So, I decided before I canned it, I would at least give it a few days. So I decided I would use it to take some pictures of fireworks. Once I got the settings right, the pictures turned out great. I decided to use the lens that came with the kit to take some pictures, and none of them turned out, they were all too dark. So, I was like, okay, it does a good job in low light situations, I guess it's good for something. I recently decided I want to start taking some more artistic portraits, rather than just still life photos. I still had this lens on my camera from the night before so i gave it a try, after playing with the settings and the lighting a bit, I got some pictures that looked pretty good on the lcd. so i took a look at them on my computer. They were amazing. They looked so professional, and the lighting that this lens picked up was perfect.After a few more shots and really learning how to use this lens, I realize that I had gotten an amazing lens. The fact that it has such a low aperture allows you too use a really fast shutter speed, so it has amazing bokeh, and in most situations, the background is completely black, making for a very professional looking photo.All in all, I wasn't impressed at first, but after using it a bit, I was amazed at the photos this lens could take.It is definitely 100 dollars well spent.I am going to upload a few of my photos so you can see what I am talking about.5 stars all the way.""
"20100113","5.0","No Need To Worry","There is really no reason not to buy this lens, unless you're considering upgrading to the 50mm 1.4 lens for a faster and more durable lens, albeit at nearly 4 times the cost.  This could be worth it, but unless you change lenses like it's your job (which it might be), or work in ridiculous conditions (America pretty much doesn't qualify), there's really no need.  For the price and the great quality that you get in return, this lens has no equal.  The 1.8 aperture is unbelievably useful, especially for stopping action, which IS does not help anyways.The sharpness of the lens is a nonfactor.  This is also true of almost any lens made in the last 50 years by a reputable dealer.  Sure, the lens is a little sharper stopped down from f/1.8, but the biggest limit to the sharpness of the picture at large apertures is in fact going to be the depth of field, not the actual sharpness of the lens.  Since only one point is in perfect focus, the rest of a 3D object will be progressively less in-focus as it gets farther away from or closer to that point, limited entirely by the depth of field.Treat this lens right, and you'll have it for a long time.  The question to ask yourself if you're considering the 50mm 1.4 is if you think getting a wider aperture is worth the cost.  Or, if you don't care about the wider aperture as much (most people don't often need it), then ask yourself if you think you'll go through 4 of these lenses in the time you would go through one of the 1.4's due to cheaper build quality.  In my opinion, if you think you might, you should be more concerned about protecting your lenses.Overall this is a spectacular wide aperture lens, the color rendition is excellent, and it makes for a fine short telephoto on a 1.6 crop factor camera, or a great normal lens on full frame.  And while using this lens as an everyday lens is fine because of it's low-light capabilities, be aware that this is not a wide-angle lens, especially on a 1.6 crop factor camera.  So you might need to back up a few steps to get everyone in the picture, which is OK so long as you have the space.  If you need a wider lens, the 18-55mm IS lens is actually quite good for the price, with the only real competition coming from the much more expensive 17-40L, or the 18-55mm 2.8 IS, which cost 6 - 10 times as much.""

"20100107","1.0","Problems this lens can cause","Recently I bought a new Canon SLR camera (Rebel XS or 1000D) with the intention of learning photography. I looked at online reviews for this lens at dpreview, by users at Amazon, at many forums - this has been rated as the best bang for the buck, and an amazing piece to have.My experience may be an outlier - but it may prevent others from facing the same issues.Pros:1. The lens is light - no bulk added to camera2. It is cheap3. The indoor photos are amazing - you can shoot a photo without flash and still get good shutter speed with the wide open aperture (1/25-1/30 with f1.8 to f2.2 - ISO400 to ISO800). Previously - I had to use a flash in the same conditions.Cons1. Construction feels cheap - you have read it all over the net so I wont go into it.2. The lens mount (stuff that attaches it to the camera) is plastic. Other lenses have metal.3. Note for first time SLR buyers - 50mm seemed nice, but it translates to 85mm as everyone will tell you. That restricts your photography options a bit. I didn't realize its zoom level - it still takes great photos but 35mm or 28mm would be much better on Rebel type cameras (non-35mm frames).The real bad part:I had ignored the con #2 - since many people have been using it for years. The lens fit onto my camera without any issue. The photos were amazing. But - the lens wont come off now (using standard procedure - press the lens release button and turn counter clockwise). After trying gently for an hour (you dont want to break your camera) - it wont come out. I checked on the web - apparently this lens does have this problem - there are reviews of this lens getting stuck on 450d and other Canon SLRs.This may be because of its plastic mount or some other reason (EF lenses not compatible with Canon Rebels :) ).Anyway - there is no solution for this on the web/with Canon - camera shops cannot fix it without risk of breaking the camera/lens. So the camera had to be mailed to Canon with lens attached - so that they can figure out the problem. If they mercifully find it to be a problem with the camera or lens - they will fix it for free - else it will be billed to me. Even if fixed - I wont use the lens again (it may get stuck again).So there you go - two days after receiving a brand new camera and lens setup - I am without one.Rare scenario? Most likely.Can it happen to others? Probably.What to do? Well - next time maybe go with better lenses - maybe EF 35mm f2 or EF 28mm f1.8 - it may be three or four times as expensive - but they wont get stuck to the camera and ruin it.""
"20100107","5.0","Excellent price/quality lens","Very good picture quality relative to similar-price zoom lens. Of course, lower f-number further improves quality, but considerably increases cost""
"20100103","2.0","Consider buying the 1.4 instead!","I was totally stoked to get the Canon 50mm EF II f1.8 and read the reviews about how cool it was, how the pictures were awesome, and how if you are careful the plastic casing wouldn't be an issue. Boy was I wrong. Let me start by telling you that I ADORE the photos I have with this lens. Completely love them, but the problem is I bought the lens in August and it has been broken more than it works. After one months the near focus didn't work. I could only shoot at infinity with it. I sent it back to Canon and it took two months to get it back! It worked fine again, but I noticed it's very loud when shooting AI SERVO (which I did on a dance concert photo shoot where I had 4,000 shots with it). It also made grinding noises. I shot with it for about another month and while away on holiday I went to take a shot and the focus didn't work again. I flipped to manual to get my shot before finding a table where I could examine the lens closer, but the focus ring would NOT turn. I took what amounted to a terribly blurry shot and went to a table. I took off the lens and tried to turn the ring again. This time, the front glass of the 1.4 fell of right in my hand! My lens is now in two pieces, and I am ready to call Canon to demand a replacement not a repair. I will then sell the replacement and use the money towards a 50mm f1.4!""
"20100103","4.0","Buy it!","This lens really 'opened up' the camera capabilties for me!I am a beginner. I got my Canon 450D as a first SLR with the 18-55 kit lens. My first additional lens was a zoom-tele lens (Canon 75-300) so I can get bigger range, mainly for wildlife when spending time with the family outdoors.the 2nd additional lens was this one. I bought it because the price was attractive and I thought that it would help taking pictures indoors with relatively low light ('natural').The lens did that, and much more! It's a great lens for taking pictures in low light. With the appertura at 'max' you can user 1/50 shutter where with the kit lens you would use 1/15. around 3 times faster which of course create much better photos. Note however that with 1.8F you can't really focus on many objects in the same frame so it's limited to portraits and 'single object' photos but for family photos that's good enough.The other great thing you can do with this lens is take photos of flowers close up - which i really love. It's not a true macro lens however: the min. focus distances is .45m which is not that close and with a 50mm focal length it means that you can't really get too close to your object or get a really high magnification. I would assume a 60mm or even a 90/100 with macro abilities would be much better here but they cost around 4x more than this one. Still, with the 1.8f the flower 'close ups' are much better! the lens is sharp, the focus is great and the results have definitely improved!another nice use is portraits. They got improved as well comparing to the lens kit.I didn't notice any problems with focusing comparing to the other lenses I have. It may not be the quickest one but it certainly performs very well in most conditions including low light. The only time I noticed an issue is when you get close to your object and starting to push that 54cm min. focus distance.the AF noise is really not an issue - I don't see why people see this as a problem in other reviews I've seen.It's true that a better build quality would have been nice. The lens looks a bit cheap and it would be nice if it at least would have created a better impression of robustness. It looks like it can crack open if it ever falls down to the floor - which I haven't tested and not going to... However, I don't see this as an issue. It's still not much different than the lens kit which means that it's built OK. it's also very light and small, you really feel like you carry a compact camera.Bottom line is - i hardly ever use any other lens anymore... this one is great for most indoor photos and family photos and for portraits and flower shots. It practically replaced the lens kit. The 1.8F really opens up camera capabilities I wasn't exposed to using the kit lens with its 5.6F value (at the same focal length).""

It is so fast it stops snow flakes in flight giving an outdoor snap-shot a real pro-like look.  The build quality is about what you would expect for $98.00 but that is it's only flaw... every thing else you might have read in other reviews, about the bokeh being not as smooth and the edges being harsh at wide open are true! But lets keep this in perspective... I took a picture of my three year old niece blowing out a candle with the Christmas tree lights in the background. I caught a moment in time! By candle light! Wow. Print the picture and hand it to Nana or Mimi and see if either of those loving matriarchs will pick up on the rectangular bokeh! (Ain't happening) No... all they will see is a really great portrait of a really cute kid, that I took. Someday I will probably have the f1.4 50mm. I will also have a few other higher value lenses but I bought this lense to have some fun with right now and on that note it gets my strong recommendation.

The bokeh is very impressive and distortion is nonexistent.  My only complaint, and it is a small one, is with the build quality.  It is all plastic and looks somewhat cheap, but then again, it is a cheap lens that takes excellent pictures.  Save the extra money you would have spent on a 1.4 and buy yourself something nice; besides the price you won't notice the difference.""
"20091228","5.0","Biggest Bang for the Buck or The Right Lense for the Right Camera","First, I would like to give a little back ground on myself ie history; My first camera was an A95 which I bought for $200.  This is a small hand held camera which I would only use for its auto focuse as I had no other idea how to use a camera.  Now this camera took absolutely amazing pictures in high light situations, as good as a DSLR that was supposed to be far above it.  However I found myself very unhappy with not being able to capture low light photos without a flash.  With a flash the image or scene is simply ruined in my opinion.Second, What was I looking for in a camera and lens; I wanted a camera that could take photos in doors outside etc in extremely low light with no flash at all.  I wanted to be able to capture moments not portriaghts that are so unatural.  IMO real photography is spontaneous, it just happens and then it is gone like that ie like a shooting star.  I wanted to capture those shooting stars.Third, My references to which judege and decide what camera and lens to pick; My father is a semi-profesional photographer.  He uses Nikon, which is supposed to make some of the best lenses if not the best lenses there is.  I would look at his photos and I simply did not like the colors at all.  Further he used a flash and I did not like that at all, it made the photos unrealistic and I simply did not want to carry around all this heavy equipement.Fourth, My Choice;  I decided that I loved the colors and abilities of my A95, for me there is no better color capture capabilities than a Canon.  Next I wanted to keep my camera as small and light as possbile, further I thought of the types of photos I was taking most often.  I found that 90% of them required no zoom, I did not want nore need zoom and I prefer to get into the action of my subject or scene inorder to capture these moments.So with all this in perspective I realised I wanted something more than some reble, but I did not want to go beyond the price range of $600.00.  What to do?  I bought a used 20D, used?  Heck it was as new as new could be for $500.00.  Next I looked at lenses my two choices for this camera were the 1.8 ($89.00) and 1.4 ($350.00, with the 1.8 I was able to stay in my perfect price range.  If I had the extra budget I would 100% go with the 1.4, don't even hesitat.Results;  I use three different modes on this camera, I am no expert at all so I need this setup to do as much as the work as possible if not all the work.  That is exactly what this camera and lense does, I use the auto P, portriat, and action settings.  I may not be a professional on dialing the camera settings in, however what I am a professional at is choice of scene, use of natural light, etc.  The result is absolutely amazing, I did not expect these results, however the photos I have produced are absolutely professional.  The quality of some of the photos are 100% magazine material, everyone in my family are asking me to take photos for me and my father is out right considering ditching his Nikons for a Canon.Conclusion; Did I make the right choice?  Heck yes I did, you are not a professional if you have all this absurde equipment you have to carry with you, and how often do you even use your zoom for that matter?  I have shown my work to some professionals and they didn't even believe that I took the photos!  They got really snotty with me telling me the merit of flashes, you have to have a zoom lens etc.Listen I can caputre my family, friends, animals outside at dusk and inside the house at night time.  You are missing out on real photography and real moments.  Stand still portiats are lame, my christmas card was 6 kids sprinting full speed in a race towards me out side.  Never seen that before, time to change the game back to what it used to be, down with the flash!""

Sure, the all-plastic construction makes it look like  cheapy knock-off, but it's not like the lens has to do any heavy lifting. Normal care taken in installing and removing this lens will ensure years of shooting.  And no one can beat the Canon lens technology.""
"20091219","5.0","Cheap Looking but Works Great","This has to be the ugliest most platicky lens I've seen, but it performs like a champ for its intended purpose.  Though, it isn't the sort of lens I would have attached at all times, and it's mainly because the overreaching zoom factor is just too much when shooting indoors in average size rooms.Yes, the low light performance indoors is phenomenal and no flash is needed.After using it for a week here are some of things I've noticed about the performance of this lens:- At f/1.8 it gets rather soft- At f/7.1 seems to be its sharpest point- The len's shallow depth of field forced me to set the 500D's auto focus mode to center point auto focus which keeps the it from hesitating.- It you like dropping or banging your equipment around, the plasticky housing/mechanism on this lens is definitely not for you.- Accidentally moving the ring in auto focus mode almost feels like the gears will strip.- Though the flash is not needed indoors for this lens, at a 7.1 lens aperture setting with a Canon ETTL flash in bounce mode seems to add a touch of perfection.Overall, I'm pretty happy with this lens, but it almost looks like it's made of sugar glass construction.  I guess I'll have to see about its reliability in the long run.  But for the price (vs other prime lens), I can't really complain.""

I have to say that the marriage of the 2 were just instant!The minute I got this nifty fifty out I was so excited and could not beleive the quality i was getting! It put me on the map as a photographer!I was using this little monster on photoshoots and now I am getting some good paying dollars for it! The f stops are perfect. I use this predominantly for portaits, families, events, you name it! I take this little tiger with me everywhere!For those who are questioning L'Series Lenses by Canon just try this one and if doesn't work for you then you can always return it!I love this little bugga!""

"20091216","5.0","A double treat","I bought this to go with my original EOS-1 film camera. 50mm has been the standard lens that others are judged by for decades. I had everything from 20mm to 600mm and was a photojournalist.When I reluctantly went digital I was pleasantly surprised by the field of view change. The REAL portrait lens for 35mm was the 85mm 1.8. With the limited compression it has the same perspective as the human eye.When put on the digital camera, the field of view is 1:6 compared to the 35mm. That bumps the lens up to 80mm on a 35mm camera. It's the perfect portrait lens for using available light. There's an intimacy to available light you don't get with flash. I can go just about anywhere and it's fast enough to shoot with ambient light. Focus is fast and sure. It's light as a feather.The lens is plastic but unless you plan to use it as a hockey puck, I don't think you'll have many problems. And you can buy 2-3 for the same price as the 1.4 version.""

"20091214","5.0","Pretty good for low light pictures!","Tried this lens, and all I have to say is amazing for low light/night time scenarios! The wide aperture helps in capturing dimly lit images with such a ease that one can do away with the use of tripod! The image quality is pretty good, especially, the shallow DOF pics come out amazing!The only thing I did not like in the lens is the amount of time it sometimes takes for auto focusing; it would make clinging noise when trying to auto focus, but once you have the focus, it will do its job!Again, good value for the money!""
"20091213","3.0","Broken within Two Weeks","As others have stated, this lens will yield very nice, sharp images. If you buy it, make sure you also get a lens hood for outdoor shooting; otherwise, expect all of your pictures to have lens flares.Unfortunately, I dropped my lens less than 2 weeks after receiving it. The drop was only 2 feet onto not-so-plush carpeting; but, it was enough force to crack the casing in half. It is a bit sad that the glass on this lens is stronger than the plastic casing 'protecting' it. Fortunately, American Express' insurance company is covering the damage. I definitely recommend buying this with a credit card so you too can get that 90 day coverage. More so, I recommend finding something a bit more sturdy even if it is a bit more expensive.""
