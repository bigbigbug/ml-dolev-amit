"20120610","2.0","Misled on Nikon Cool Pix","This item was purchased as a gift.  When the recipient talked about using the camera it became obvious it was one which did not have a rechargable battery.  This was an embarassment as I thought ALL modern cameras were equipped with rechargable batteries.  No where in the write-up did it mention the battery type.  I will now have to replace that camera with one which does have a rechargable battery.  This is not only an additional expense, but an embarassment to me.  I would ask you and your suppliers to clearly specify the type of battery contained in ANY digital device.  I would advise caution to all prospective buyers on this feature.""
"20120609","1.0","I returned it","I took this camera on vacation to Niagara Falls and was sorely disappointed.  After taking several pictures I got a 'battery depleted' message and the camera shut off.  I missed a lot of great pictures until I replaced the batteries.  Then I took a few more pictures and it shut off again telling me the battery was depleted again!  It also told me the memory card was full, which was impossible.  I was very upset with this camera and returned it for a refund.""

"20120602","1.0","No Good","There was too long of a delay between pressing the button and the picture being taken.  And that was when it worked.  Sometimes we had to press the button two or three times before it would take a picture.  Then, when it did take a photo, it wouldn't let us take another one right away.  We had to wait several seconds before it was possible to take a second shot.  Very frustrating.  Picture quality wasn't very good either.  We sent our camera back to Amazon and got a refund.  Yeah, Amazon.  Boo, Nikon.""
"20120602","5.0","Great Camera","This Camera is not only everything it advertises to be but has surprised me at every turn.The battery life is incredible by comparison to other digital cameras I have purchased in the past.Picture quality has been above expectations for every shot including scenic views on a trip to the Empire state building.  There is a small time delay when taking pictures, but this can be corrected by using a faster memory card, and turning your flash to auto, rather than On.I recommend the camera highly for a less expensive carry camera!""

"20120601","5.0","Pleasantly surprised","Why did I buy this product? Long story if you have time. My wife and I were on a road trip to Indianapolis to visit our daugher and her family. We were planning to drive about four thousand miles total for the round trip. Along the way it was my opportunity to photograph historic districts in the cities where we stopped and some Catholic shrines and churches. I was carrying a Nikon 5400 and a Nikon F100 film camera. The charger on my 5400 conked out so I ordered the Nikon L26 to be sent to our daughters house. I was able to use it on the return trip and I was amazed at the image quality. I didn't want another charger to be worrying about so the two double AA batteries on this camera were the perfect solution. Now I could power my Nikon F100 and the Nikon L26 with a very simple reliable, easy to find power source. Perfect for road trips. This camera is very simple to use. Great image quality and portability are two reasons for anyone who wants to buy this camera. I wish that Nikon would make more cameras which use AA batteries.""
"20120601","5.0","Great Point & shoot Camera","This camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures.  The 3' LCD screen is wonderful. Although there is an instruction manual, I did not really find a need to reference it as the camera is very intuitive/easy to figure out without the aid of the manual.  I love the fact that it uses regular batteries as opposed to rechargable.  When I go on a trip or an outing, there is no added bulk of packing the charger and no fear of it not being charged.  I simply carry 2 extra AA batteries in my purse.""

"20120528","4.0","I am happy with it overall","I bought this camera to have something handy in my purse or pocket at all times. I food blog, I submit random shots to the local news and I like to take quick snapshots on the go when I find a cool craft or when I see a location that I might want to go back to with clients and take some REAL photos.All my professional gear is Canon. I have Nikon cameras but I honestly prefer Canon because I like the color and sharpness I get with Canon and it just feels good in my hand.Brand preference is a personal thing some people like Nikon better and I am fine with that I am not here to argue the Canon v.s. Nikon attributes.What I like about this camera: It uses an SD card and if you will invest in a quality SD card that has some speed to it you will be happy because the faster the photos load to the card, the shorter time you will have to wait between shots.It uses 2 AA batteries and they are handy, cheap and I never have to worry about forgetting to charge the batteries, (remember I want something that is ALWAYS handy and ready).  This camera is very light even when the batteries are in, but it feels more substantial in my hand than the fujifilm or the sony or the samsung did, they feel 'pastic-y'.  I like the red color it is rich looking,  I like the 3 inch viewing screen, but I hate not having a viewfinder (that is just something I am used to and will have to learn to work with) . On the plus side I can wear glasses and still take great photos.  I like the one touch switch over to video, but admittedly I will probably never use the video feature.  The menu and shooting modes are easy to navigate, it is very simple to change from portrait to landscape to museum and back to auto. I never even took out the instructions and I was taking photos in less than 3 minutes after opening the box.  Hard to beat a 16 MP camera for $99. If you find a better one let me know I will take this one back and buy it.What I do NOT like about this camera: blurred and distorted photos when using the zoom. In order to get a good photo I have to zoom slowly and if I edit on screen before transferring to iPhoto, it seems to minimize the blurring.Indoor shots are a little disappointing unless you have time to snap, look at it to be sure, and re-take shots, in other words take several shots and try different modes I would say that 6 out of 10 indoor shots are usable.If you expect to take 'spontaneous' snap shots quickly to catch first steps for example I am not entirely confident you will get them.  The lag time is a MAJOR dislike for me, by the time It focuses and flashes my subject has moved. I was able to edit most pictures and they looked fine on Facebook once posted. Could I blow these up to a 24X36 and hang it on my wall? probably not it would look blurred.Bottom line this camera performs as expected for a basic point and shoot.  I think most people who take pictures for fun, or to share with friends and family, or like me to have something acceptable for Facebook type images, you would be happy with it. If you are looking for WOW, AMAZING, PROFESSIONAL photos this is not the camera for you.  I think that Fuji Finepix T400 camera with the 16MP and he 40X Zoom would blow this one away, but it is $459 so I would expect it to be better than this one.""
"20120526","5.0","Can't go wrong with a Nikon","Bought this one for my mother's birthday coming up soon. What prompted me buy it was the fact my niece has the Nikon Coolpix L20 ( I think that's it anyway ) and it always took good pictures. I had also bought my wife and daughter the Nikon Coolpix L22 and neither one of them have complained one bit. They both went threw (combined) five cameras, from various manufactures (Olympus being one of them) and nothing came close to the quality and ease at which you can use these Nikon Coolpix series cameras. They are fantastic little cameras. I tested this one out when I first got it to make sure it worked alright and it's just as it should be. This model has a better optical zoom and bigger MegaPixal count than previous models and for the price it beats out a ton of the other cameras it's size. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one at all.The video is of real good quality also. Took the wife's camera to a concert last month and the quality of the video and sound were really good. I was surprised to say the least, as it was a rock concert and I figured the sound would be distorted. Nope, good picture and sound, and that was on the L22, so I can only imagine the L26 will even be better with it's better optical zoom.It uses two double A batteries. The whole family uses the Duracell Rechargeables, which saves you a bunch of money over time. The memory cards for the Coolpix series are getting pretty cheap also, so no worries about expensive cards.Have you wanted a digital camera or just wanted to upgrade what you have? Buy it.Thinking of a gift for someone, even a person who's never used a digital camera? But it. It's not overly complicated like some can be and they will love it.I've only bought Olympus (digital) for myself over the past 13 years, BUT when the time comes to replace my DSL camera with a newer model, it'll be a Nikon that replaces it.""

"20120524","5.0","great camera","Wanted a 'pocket camera' to take when my regular camera might be cumbersome.  This camera is lightweight, but works awesome.  Quick shutter speed has caught my children mid jump and flip without blurring!  I've taken pictures indoors at the zoo and outside too, and they all look wonderful.  Remember it's not heavy duty, and treat it right.....you'll love it if you do!""
"20120523","5.0","The camera you will use the most!","This camera is awesome! It's to the mind what Gigabytes of memory is to a computer.I would not categorize myself as a shutter-bug by any stretch, but I do like to capture the occasional 'special moments, which this camera performs perfectly.Mostly though, I will be using this camera to gather the same sort of information where years ago I used the Polaroid, which was information one would usually relegate to a notepad.The features in this camera allow you to do just about anything you would ever need from a camera, and the picture are crystal clear. I say 'about' because I am sure I haven't even scratched the surface as to the capabilities of this camera.It was easy to set up as a simple point and shoot, so I was literally taking pictures in a few minutes. But even before I set up the camera for simple 'point and shoot', I read the direction meticulously and suggest this to be the best approach for everyone. Because even though you may not understand everything at the time you read the directions, it will all become clear to you when you come across it again while manipulating the buttons on the camera itself.I would sincerely say in no more than a weeks time of using this camera I was expert enough to accomplish anything I wanted to do.In all the reviews I read regarding this camera, I would say the women were spot on, whereas the men generally were to critical. Trust me as a man I can say it is in our nature to over-think just about everything!  Trust me, I used to be one of those types! But, alas, eventually I learned that everything isn't exactly rocket science!!The price was great, I can only think the reason is, it's a new product and they want to get of to a good start.  I can tell you this, I have spent more than twice as much for less than half the quality and features I have found in this camera. Definitely a great value!I am retired now from a career in mechanical engineering, where my use of a camera was primarily for gathering technical information. It is different now but not all that much, because I still use a camera for gathering information. :)ON THE NEGATIVE: About the camera (per se), NOTHING!But in regard to a camera case, I was unable to find a case to match my lifestyle and the size I would have perferred. The ideal case for me would have had an armored exterior, and interior with just enough room to hold the camera, two AA batteries and a extra SD memory card.A horizontal belt loop equal to the horizontal length of the case, and suitable for mounting on a  1-1/2 inch ( nylon web ) belt.The opening would be at the top with the camera situated ( shutter release button up ),and opening equal to half the height of the camera.I was not able to find a case of this description but I found one that was somewhat close, that was also featured at Amazon.com, in close proximity of this camera.I finally purchased the 'Case LOGIC' case, that featured a small, silver, belt loop style, ( Carabiner ) and added armored protection, of my own design, that included a ('Zytel') panel sewn in a ('U' shape configuration) within a piece of ('micro-fiber) cloth.The armor was then assembled in the case, such that the Camera when sitting (shutter release button up) was cradled in the U-shaped protector.Otherwise, without the (armor) the 'Case LOGIC' case would be perfectly fine for just about everyone. Nice case!I hope this information is helps someone.Live Good and Happy!""
"20120518","1.0","Poor Quality Control","The first camera I received was totally inoperative right out of the box. Lens would try to open then close and camera would power off. Several times it showed a 'Lens Error' on the LCD screen but otherwise no success getting it to take a single picture. Decided to get a replacement and of course Amazon had the replacement on my front steps in 2 days. Unfortunately, the second camera had a defective playback button so I was unable to review pictures or movies taken with the camera.  I don't expect much from a $100 camera but it would be nice if Nikon's quality control caught these defects before they left their factory. Also, neither of the packages had any signs of rough handling in shipment so again it seems to point toward poor quality control on Nikon's part.  I've had inexpensive Nikon point and shoots in the past and always been pleased so very disappointed and not sure I will buy another Nikon.""

"20120509","2.0","It Just Doesn't Measure Up","I've ordered many things from Amazon, but this is the first item I've returned.  I wanted a simple but effective point-and-shoot camera that takes decent pictures.  The general operational layout is actually pretty good.  The CD-based reference manual is pretty well written.  The problem is in the execution.The easy automatic mode, or whatever it's called, did not work well.  I'd try to take a picture in my back yard at dusk, but the flash may or may not be invoked and the image is blurry.  I was careful to wait until the white brackets turned green before fully depressing the button. I tried other scenes with varying results.When the camera does take a good picture, it's really good.  Unfortunately it's not all the time.  This is the first Nikon I've owned.  The other brand I've used never gave me this problem.One other thing.  It says deep in the reference manual that your image storage card (not included with camera) has to be class 6 or higher if you're going to shoot movies.  I can understand that, but such information should be more prominent.""
"20120507","1.0","my phone takes better pictures","We bought this camera to take with us on vacation to the beach and Disneyland.  I thought I could trust the Nikon name but not at all.  This is a CRAPPY camera! the photos come out blurry and it really struggles in anything other than full light.  Don't even try to take pictures at night.  This camera is a joke!  I should have just spent a bit more and got a Canon.  (heck, even a disposable camera from the drug store would have done a better job than this.)  Nikon wasn't very helpful when I called, either. VERY disappointed.""

"20120503","3.0","I liked it at first...","I wanted to love this camera based on the other reviews, but it came up short for me. Because I do a lot of high-resolution scrapbooks and greeting cards featuring my kids, I needed a camera that could outshine the 8MP camera on my iPhone (and let's face it, the iPhone's zoom feature is a joke). 16MP was more than enough, and the pictures came out beautiful, but there's a fatal flaw on this camera I just can't ignore:It's useless for children. My toddlers move -fast-, and the shutter speed on this camera is absolutely appalling. By the time the camera is able to capture the shot, the moment is completely lost and gone, and that's 50% of the reason I wanted a new camera (the MP resolution being the other 50%). At least now I know when I go to buy a different camera to watch for this feature. I find it incredible that my phone captures photos more instantaneously than a Nikon.If all you take is still shots, this may be the camera for you. I was impressed with the photo quality, the make of the camera, the ease of use, and the controls. The zoom feature is great but again, much too slow to capture the nanosecond of time children are stationary. The 3' LCD is also very good quality and the auto-focus works very well. The auto scene settings are really all you need to create great photos.All in all, this is a good, but not a great buy. I can't overlook the Achilles' heel of the ultra-slow shutter, but I would recommend this for someone who only needs still or landscape portraiture.UPDATE 4/5/12: after returning this camera (thanks Amazon), I purchased the Panasonic DMC25K. Although about $35.00 separates these cameras, I was more than satisfied with my new purchase. The Panasonic's shutter speed, controls, and scene modes are far superior for such a small price difference. If you're shopping around with a little flexibility in price, I can't recommend the Panasonic DMC25K enough over this Nikon.""
"20120502","3.0","Good for a new camera user","Found the nikon L26 to work very well. I like the button layout that makes it really easy to use. Also love AA battery and that is why I picked this one, along with its small size. I am returning it because it has no manual controls for shutter speed. I like to take a lot of night photo's with full moon landscapes out in the woods and you absolutely have to slow down the shutter. Good camera for someone who just wants to point and shoot but I like to play around a little more then that. I got a canon SX150 SI on the way. It has the manual features I am looking for and much more yet cost only about 45 dollars more.""

"20120417","5.0","THE VERY BEST OF ALL DIGITAL CAMERAS","I truly deeply LOVE this camera; it is sooo easy to use and the quality is there.  It even lets you select the final size of your photos in pixels.  Uploading pictures is a PLEASURE, NOTHING COMPLICATED IN USING IT, unlike other digitals.  It is truly a point and shoot camera!  I take photos of fast moving puppies and it keeps up with them, no blurs!  I recommend it to all!  The price was more than worth it without having to spend thousand(s) of dollars.  It is meant for the amateur photographer and is simply an absolute VERY TRUE JOY to use!  I can't say enough about this VERY excellent camera.  Wish I had had it years ago, but maybe it would not be the excellent camera it is today!  This is the VERY best digital camera I have ever used and meets all my needed requirements, especially for the puppies in picture taking!  It replaces the KODAK cameras I have used over the last 11 years with Kodak now going out of business in this area anyway. I recommend it to all amateurs, well worth the money which is not that much.""
"20120416","5.0","Buy It!","When buying electronics on the internet you never really know what you're getting; sure the details of the device sound impressive but are they really, and is it the best deal possible with the constant progress in technology? (Hopefully this review will answer those questions.)The Nikon Coolpix L26 is simply an excellent camera for an excellent price.  16 mega pixels make the photo clear and crisp; good for landscapes, amateur photography, and candid photos. The 5x Zoom is adequate and suits the camera very well. Best of all, the camera is very easy to use and because its battery operated all you need to do is insert the batteries and a memory card and you're good to go.In conclusion if you want a good camera for a low price that's pretty idiot proof this is the one for you and apparently is for me as well.""

"20120324","3.0","Nikon L24, an ok camera for 39.00","I purchased an L24 at Best Buy in Columbus, Ohio for 39.00 and was really happy with the price.  I love the look of the camera, and the ease of use.  It takes good photos, does well in low light conditions, and has an excellent macro function. However, it has the weakest battery door of any camera ever made.  To make things worse, the springs at the bottom of the battery compartment are intensely strong and put far too much pressure on the battery door.  Having read about the battery door issue prior to buying the camera, I took a small allen wrench and placed the short end underneath each battery spring, pushed a Sharpie down into the compartment and pressed on each spring until I felt them 'give' a bit.  It relieved quite a lot of pressure when trying to close the door.  Sadly, 6 weeks ago I dropped the camera (it was in a padded bag) and the battery door latch broke.  Nikon will not cover this under warranty, so like many other owners of the L24 I now have a small piece of tape holding the door closed.  I would recommend this camera except for this one problem.  If you don't mind securing the battery door with tape, buy this camera, it works well in all other respects.""
