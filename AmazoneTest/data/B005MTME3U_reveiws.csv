"20120609","1.0","Lens Error(s)!!","I've been a big Canon lover over the years.  I've had 4 DSLR's and some pocket size cameras like the S95 and now the S100.  Loved the S95.  When the S100 arrived at our house, we were very excited to test it out during a trip to Las Vegas.  After a few pictures in Vegas, my wife started to get Lens errors.  (I checked on Google and learned that a lot of people were getting these errors).  No problem, I thought, everyone gets a bad piece of electronics every once in a while....and I've had good luck with Canon  I sent the S100 to Canon for repair.  It took about 3 weeks from the time I sent it to them until the time I got it back.  They claimed they replaced the optics and it was a warranty repair.  My wife and I started taking a few pictures.  We got about 10 pictures in with the 'Repaired Camera', when we started seeing the SAME Lens Error!!  Very frustrating.  The S100 has been re-sent to Canon for repair.  It's been about three weeks and  I'm still waiting for the camera to arrive.  I dont' have high hopes that it will be fixed this time around.  At this point, I just want a new camera to replace this lemon.""
"20120608","4.0","Has rattling sound during video recording on a quiet room","I had several pocket cameras from Canon before. I choose pocket camera so that I can always bring it everywhere with me to take pictures and also videos. I bought this camera because it can record video in 1080p resolution (albeit at 24 fps). But then I discovered when I use it in a quiet room, I hear rattling sounds (woodpecker sounds) every time I move the camera around. After reading forums and experimenting myself, I concluded that this is because of the Auto Focus feature of this camera while in video recording mode. What you hear is really the mechanical things moving inside the camera body. So while this keeps the video stay sharp all the time because of the auto focus, you will hear the unpleasant rattling sound as well.To fix this, especially if you care more on the sound than the sharpness of the video, you might want to disable auto focus while in video. Here's how to do it:  - Set to 'P' (Programs). You cannot use 'AUTO' since the camera won't let you set manual focus.  - Aim camera to the object. Press shutter half-way to set focus automatically into this object.  - Press left button (on the four-way navigator) and select 'MF'. This will activate Manual Focus while shooting video. Note 'MF' text should appear on the LCD.  - Press 'Video' button (the red circle) to start video recording.Another tips is you may can set the RING FUNCTION button to MF (manual focus). So all you need to do is to turn the ring once to enter Manual Focus just *before* you press 'Video' button. Hope this helps! I do hope that Canon find a way to eliminate this rattling sound on their next generation camera.""

"20120527","1.0","Lens Error Makes This Gem Completely Useless","I bought the S100 after doing lots of research on the S95. I was really excited to take it on my 6 week backpacking trip through Asia. The camera worked exceptionally for the first 5 weeks and took amazing pictures. On week 5, the camera crapped out on me in Beijing right before the Great Wall.I got the dreaded 'Lens Error' message and the camera wouldn't take any pictures. Just a black screen. This is shameful. After reading plenty of reviews about the same issue on Amazon, I figured I would be careful and it wouldn't happen to me. I was dead wrong. I pampered this camera the whole time, it has never been dropped or exposed to any moisture.Bottom line: I don't trust this camera the least bit. Don't let what happened to me happen to you. This camera is getting sold after its repair. There's no way Canon doesn't realize how many people are having this problem, especially after all the negative reviews on Amazon.For alternatives, I would urge people to look into the Panasonic LX5 or the Fuji X10. Both are a bit larger but take excellent pictures.""
"20120526","4.0","Love it.","Bought it for a recent trip to Africa. The first one I received from Amazon didn't take good pictures so I exchanged it for another. I am very happy with the pictures the S100 took in Africa. The HD video is stunning.(except for the 20X zoom- forget it it will not focus) This thing is a full on camcorder! The flash popping up on the left hand side where your fingers rest is annoying, I must admit. But it's a minor trade off to have a camera of this size and see the pictures and video it takes- you just can't can't beat it.""
"20120103","4.0","S100 vs S95","I have been seeking an affordable camera which will give high quality photos and video clips for both home and work purposes. During the past week, I have closely compared the S100 to the S95 by taking a series of approximately sixty photos and five videos at various locations using the same shooting conditions whenever possible for both cameras. Afterwards, the photos and videos were compared on a 27-inch monitor. Here are a few of my observations. Both cameras gave excellent outdoor photos during a clear, sunny day. However, on my large monitor, the S100 gave comparably excellent indoor photos in either auto or P mode even when zoomed while the S95 showed more overall graininess particularly when zoomed or in low light. Although the photo image quality for both cameras was excellent, the video image quality was different. Out of fairness, it is important to note that the S100 will shoot 1080p HD video whereas the S95 is only capable of shooting 720p HD video. Thus, it is not surprising that the S100's HD video image quality was improved compared to the S95's. However, in addition, the S100 gave smoother video playback with good autofocus even when zooming. More astonishing was the ability of the S100 to give excellent video quality under a wide range of indoor lighting conditions while the S95 gave bright purple lines on both the LCD and in video playback when it was near various types of long-life incandescent light bulbs. The bright purple lines were reproducible, observed near three light bulbs in my house, and made some of the S95 video clips completely unusable. (I do not know if my copy of the S95 was defective.) Since I will use my new camera for work-related photos and videos, too, the purple lines on the S95 were unacceptable to me. The battery life of the S100 seemed poor during the first charge/discharge cycle. I did try the GPS, and while it worked, it drained the battery more quickly than expected. With neither the GPS nor its logger on, the battery life is more tolerable now that I am past the first couple of charge/discharge cycles, but I plan to have a spare battery with me at all times when I use the S100. Based on all of my tests, the features of the S100 are excellent for its size. The photo images seemed to have greater clarity on my big monitor than those from the S95, and the S100's video quality is much improved over the S95. My only complaint is that the S100 is a power hungry little camera, and I think that Canon's design engineers should consider a longer-lasting battery even if it makes the camera a little larger. I am now a very happy S100 owner, and I am glad that I took the time to do my photo and video tests. The battery issue is the only reason I gave the S100 four stars instead of five. It is worth noting that owners of both the S95 and S100 will benefit from learning to use the different shooting modes as well as knowing about options available in the recording and function menus. In addition to Canon's User Manual, there are a couple of excellent books specific to using the S95 that are also helpful for learning how to get the best quality photos and videos from the S100. Search 'S95' at any bookstore to find them. One of these books has recently been updated for the S100:  'Photographer's Guide to the Canon PowerShot S100' by A.S. White.Update:  Since several reviewers have observed S100 photos that were entirely out of focus or had edges that were out focus, I reexamined selected photos for the S95 and S100.  For this examination, my 27-inch monitor was set at a screen resolution of 2560 x 1440, which is the highest available setting.  In addition, I zoomed in on the photos so that only 8.3% (1/12th) of an overall photo filled the screen.  For each photo, all four edges were carefully examined for clarity and compared to the center.  The photos selected for examination had considerable detail in them.  Some had pine needles, tree branches, bridge trestles, and buildings near the edges.  Others had wallpaper designs, signs, and posters with words printed on them.  (No low light or zoomed photos were selected.)  With only 8.3% of the photos filling the entire screen of my 27-inch monitor, the images on my copy of the S100 were uniform in clarity all the way out to the edges and corners.  For the selected photos, the images on my copy of the S95 were similarly uniform in clarity everywhere except for the lower right corner.  Surprisingly, the lower right corner was consistently blurry in multiple photos.  It is worth noting that with only 8.3% of the photos filling the entire screen, both cameras gave slightly fuzzy images, but when entire photos were visible, each camera gave sharp, clear images.  Some reviewers have complained about the LCD screen, too.  When I was comparing the S95 to the S100, I did note that the LCD image on the S95 was more pleasing than the image on the S100.  While I was considering this, I got out my old Canon PowerShot SD550 and compared the image on its LCD screen with that on the S100 and S95.  Next I compared each image with the real-life objects each camera was supposed to be depicting.  With the LCD screen in the default setting for each camera, the images on both the SD550's and S100's screens showed colors that were more faithful to real life while the image on the S95's screen appeared more vivid than real life.  It is worth noting that the screen brightness can easily be changed for indoor or outdoor photos.  There are five brightness settings available on the S100.  I assume that these settings are available on the S95, too.""
"20120103","1.0","The LX5 Owns this","Yes, it's got great high ISO performance. However, it has lousy low ISO daytime performance. This is due to the new and untested CMOS sensor.What's the deal breaker, that none of the reviews mention? As an avid night time / astro photographer, the 1 second exposure limit above ISO 80 compared to the LX 5 2.0 250 second limit is a HUGE problem for me. That, combined with scattered reports of quality control issues (my copy from best buy was indeeed very soft in the corners) leaves me with no choice but to stick with my Lx5. If only they had made it a little bit better with a wider aperture it would be appreciated as it's size is a great benefit over the competition. So, I'm holding out for the S110 or S150.... it's just not worth $100 more than the already good S95 or Lx5. Either of those are much better cameras for the money.""

"20111227","5.0","Excellent quality in a tiny package","I own a Nikon D7000  dslr and several high end Nikon lenses. I love my D7000 but I was looking for a small camera that I could carry everywhere i went. I wanted something that was truly portable - something roughly the size of an iphone that would fit in my pocket.  I heard good things about the S95 so when I heard that a new version of this camera had been released I decided to go for it. I have not been disappointed. The image quality is excellent. It is of course not up to the same standard as my Nikon D7000 but I have been pleasantly surprised at just how capable the S100 is. For the money and the tiny size it is a very good performer.Of course no camera is perfect and the S100 is no exception.  The battery is very poor. I knew it wouldn't be up to the amazing standard of my D7000 but I expected more. If you are going to be doing any serious shooting you will need to invest in a second battery. My other minor quibble is with the auto ISO function. For some reason, you can't use auto ISO in manual. Not a deal breaker but I would have liked to have had this capability.This camera has a lot of advanced features and it really isn't intended for the casual user who shoots on 'auto' mode. If you are not interested in exploring the advanced settings, you should save your money and get a more basic Canon. This is a camera for someone who wants to control their photography.Overall, this is a great camera for a dslr user who wants an 'everyday' take everywhere camera with advanced features. Highly recommended!""

"20111223","5.0","Outstanding point and shoot camera","So that you know where I am coming from, I am not an expert photographer, but a novice/intermediate. I do not own a DSLR because I do not want the weight and bulk. I carefully researched many point and shoot cameras before buying the S100.That said, I am extremely happy with this camera. It takes much better pictures than my Canon ELPH SD780. Better accuracy in focusing, better color, and sharper.I have taken over 100 photos in one week, and almost every single shot is usable. I have never experienced such consistent performance from a digital camera.Pros:* Great in low light, especially with the flash off. I got better results in general never using the flash.* Form factor makes it portable.* Manual control options. As others have noted, there are some limitations like flash control and exposure length for night shots.* 24 mm capability makes more a difference than I thought it would.Cons:* Battery life is short; 200 shots per full charge seems about right.* Placement of flash is inconvenient. However, you might not even need to use the flash very often.The S100 is not cheap, but I am willing to pay for such high performance in a small package. Overall, this is a wonderful camera, and I am happy with my choice.I bought this camera from Best Buy.""
"20111223","4.0","A review from just an amateur photo-taker...  not a photographer!","A review from an amateur photo-taker - NOT your professional photographer with all the technical jargon!  :PI am so happy this camera is here!  Long awaited and it was a heavy debate between this and the recently reduced-priced S95.  Chose the S100 since it's just the upgraded version with some improvements and enhancements.  I think the S95 is still a great option.  From what I hear the professional DSLR camera users love to at least have this camera around when they don't have access to their SLRs!  Now I also have an SLR - and it is just BIG and not portable - so this is a much better option for me to acquire the high quality pictures I want but with an easier and better ability to control certain aspects (with the two different wheels) without having to lug that big SLR around.First thing - Thank you, Amazon, for the better pricing!  At $429, it beats the other vendors selling it for $479+S/H.  And after a delay in shipping due to delay in manufacturing, it arrived before Christmas!  Not a gift, but I'll be excited to use it for family Christmas pictures and play around with it  :)Now here's something to note - it doesn't come with a memory card!  I did not pay attention to these details when purchasing.  It's been a year since I've gotten a camera so I can't remember if this is the norm...I sort of always remembered cameras coming with a minuscule-sized memory card...but it didn't.  So alas, now I have to wait a couple of days of a new one.  I could just take a memory card out of my DSLR or from my previous point-and-shoot camera, but it has to be reformatted to this camera.  I don't know exactly what that entails, but I figured I'd just wait for the new one to go in the new camera, reformat it, and then all my cameras will still have a memory card.  Don't be careless like me - order a memory card when you order the camera!So on a side note:  Just ordered an 8GB transcend SD class 10 memory card from Amazon...Recently did rapid and minimal research on the different 'classes' of memory cards, and since I had read a few reviews talking about slightly slower than ideal performance of this camera, I thought it might just be better to maximize with a class 10 (higher processing/writing speeds.)  I don't really know if that helps, but I figure it can't hurt.  This is never something I had ever thought about with previous cameras.  This camera accepts SD, SDHC, and SDXC.Now if you've read other reviews - you know the battery-life is not ideal (so consider buying a separate battery pack for those big special events or vacation days).  The manual says you can get ~200 shots on the battery life, and that a 4GB memory card can save about 1231 shots.  So choose your memory card accordingly.As a right-handed user, it's hard to get the wrist strap through the little hole.  (There is another one on the upper left hand corner for left-handed people I assume)  I had to use some floss with a floss threader so finally slide it through!  Not a big deal and only a one-time thing once you get the strap through.This little pop up flash is frustrating and an insanely dumb feature in my opinion.  It's right where your left hand may naturally hold the camera, so I feel like it's bad if it's constantly a little jarred by the unknowning person who is taking a picture for you.LED screen is big and beautiful, crisp and clear!  Love it.Have been playing around with the different settings and it's great - much easier to control different settings with this camera than regular point and shoot.  I intend to learn more about photography basics with this camera.Just after a few weeks of using this...I do think that (At least on Auto setting) - I have mostly liked my outdoor photos from my Canon SD 850IS point and shoot better, but I think the trick is using this camera on the Aperture, Shutter, or Manual modes with increased ability to change the settings with ease.  But let's see.Also...manual comes on a disk instead of a thick printed booklet along with some Canon photo software.Excited to have more fun with this camera!  :)""
"20111219","5.0","Great enthusiast camera, don't recommend for P&Shooter","I've owned about 30 compact digital cameras and the S100 is, by all means, one of my favorites. I've owned and used it since mid-October, taking well over 2000 shots.After taking time to learn how to make adjustments when using the 24mm/equiv lens, I have to ask myself how I ever lived without a lens with that wide angle. I've taken some of the best inside shots of my family, ever, with the camera.I also like the longer focal length over my S90, and the high ISO performance (assuming I get the settings right for a scene).If you're a full auto mode user, you may be disappointed with the S100, especially if you don't use center (single area) autofocus. Learn to use P Mode and adjust settings (including Custom Color settings) as needed (eg. white balance, ISO, Exposure Compensation, Image Stabilization, saturation, Focus Mode and focus point size, etc). If you're not willing to learn how to tweak some of these settings, save yourself some money and buy a less expensive, real Point and Shoot camera. If you don't like to post-process images, this camera may not be for you either.I take my s100 with me everywhere and it's a worthy companion to my DSLR.Bottom line: if you're a pro or photo enthusiast, the Canon s100 is worthy of your consideration. If you're a die-hard point-and-shooter, look elsewhere.ps: I'm not into video but I've tried it on the s100. It's amazing though, for those who use a dedicated video cam, I'm sure they'll point out weaknesses.""
"20111218","1.0","Poor image quality","As Richard Wanderman noted in his review ('I have not taken a sharp picture yet with this camera'), I was unable to take a photo (even with the camera set on 'Auto' for point-and-shoot photos) that was sharply in focus.  I took the same 'Auto' photos with my old Sony CyberShot DSC-W120 and with the new Canon PowerShot S100, and the comparison of the two sets of photos clearly showed that the Sony consistently produced pictures that were in sharp focus while the new Canon S100 did not.  And it didn't matter whether the photos were close-up or long range.There were other things that irritated me about the Canon S100, some of which may have been a matter of becoming used to it but, for instance, on the Sony, it is sufficient to turn the dial to movie mode and depress the shutter to shoot a movie but on the Canon, even when setting the dial to movie mode, one must still press the separate 'record button' (and depress the shutter) to shoot a movie.The Canon's handbook (or operating manual) is 236 pages long (on a CD) and it isn't always logically written and compiled, that is, all the information that one might need, e.g., for shooting and downloading a movie, is not presented in one useful place.As others have noted, with the Canon, one must be careful to avoid holding the camera by its top left side, as that is where the flash pops up.Perhaps I had just not learned how to use it correctly but in the Auto mode, the Canon appears to have two choices - flash off or flash on, with the auto function of the camera deciding whether a flash is needed.  In situations where the background is bright (and thus the camera decides that a flash is not needed, even if one points the focus at a darker spot in the foreground), the flash doesn't fire.  Again, on the Sony, there is an option to use a 'fill-in' flash, when one wants the foreground to be well-lit.Not withstanding the fact that the Canon S100 is clearly a very sophisticated camera, I felt that it was $429 poorly spent (largely because of the poor Image Quality) and so felt obliged to return the Canon PowerShot S100 to the shop where I had bought it (Best Buy).""

ISO 1600 results from the S100 are quite impressive, especially if you shoot in RAW post process.  ISO 3200 is usable for small prints.Now on to the lens.  I love the wide end of the lens, it is a slightly soft in the corners wide open, but not objectionably so.  28mm and up it is quite sharp at all apertures over the entire frame. I'm happy to say that my camera does not suffer from any lens abnormalities that have been found on review sites.  Hopefully this is a sign Canon has fixed their production issue.""

"20111215","1.0","Overpriced.  Overhyped.  Game Over...","The Canon S100 is not exactly the best BANG FOR THE BUCK when compared to the Sony ILC.

Better pictures, features (like panorama), & video capabilities, even.  Oh yes, the flexibility to change the lens in the future.After reviewing cropped pictures of the s100 (at f/2.0) & the nex-c3 (w/ e-mount lens pancake f/2.8) with iso set at 6400, the difference is night and day.  The nex-c3 retains picture details while still controlling noise... while the s100 produced washed out images.  So imagine the nex-c3's performance in lower iso's.

"20111214","4.0","Read the manual","My first S100 camera needed to be replaced because all of my photos were soft and needed sharpening. Plus auto focus was having a bit of a hard time focusing, I called canon and they wanted to repair it but I chose to replace it since I only had it two weeks. The photographs on my second camera are excellent even past 100% on Photoshop. I bought this for the RAW capabilities. RAW can only be used in 4:3 aspect ratio. I don't understand that limitation.My one suggestion is read  the manual and play with the camera while doing so. While watching TV, with my laptop on which was needed to read the manual, I took a lot of of photos flash-less indoors. Even at a high ISO noise was limited.In the various modes I took  photos  with the DR on & off and at 200% & 400%, there is a big difference, turned on & off the shadow protection,  ..et ... I wish the zoom was more then it is. I suppose they are saving that for the next update since the technology is available.  The fact that this camera cost a small fortune & the 'big' manual is not included is annoying.  The money lost in customers returning not only this but other cameras because they don't know how to use them most likely outweighs the cost of printing. Do you hear me Canon???

"20111212","4.0","I got a second copy, it's much better","I have the S100, had the S95 and S90 before it and took magnificent images with both S90 and S95. I'm a professional photographer, have both a Canon 5D and 5D2 and many high end L lenses. I've had many Canon Elphs before the S series as well as various G series bodies.The S90 was a spectacular camera, the S95 improved on it and I was very much looking forward to this camera because of improvements with ergonomics and the extra 4mm in wide angle at 24mm. In fact, I find distortion on the edges of 24mm unacceptable and have zoomed to 28 for much of what I've done with this camera.I have not taken a sharp picture yet with this camera and I have plenty of experience with both this line of cameras and with photography in general. I don't know what's causing the blurriness, probably not the CMOS sensor, more likely the lens, but I agree with others giving this camera a less than wonderful review that the IQ in the S100 is not up to snuff. It may be a copy to copy issue, I don't know.Time will tell if this is a copy to copy issue (a few bad apples) or something affecting all copies of this camera. I do know that I'm not going to keep the copy I have, I'm returning it and have ordered (re-ordered) an S95 as they're quite inexpensive now at $229.If Canon comes out with a statement about this and explains that it was a few bad apples I'll re buy the camera in a second, it's exactly the camera I want and if the IQ is just as good as the S90 and S95 I'll be happy as the ergonomics have improved considerably.Update:I ordered a second copy of this camera from Amazon and the problems of the first are completely gone. I'm guessing it's a problem copy to copy with some lenses.I particularly like having a 24mm lens in this camera and the extra 4mm of wide are very meaningful for what I use this camera for (hiking, landscape images). It's macro mode allows closer focusing than the S95, it will shoot at higher ISO with less noise, or, another way to put that is at the same ISO it exhibits less noise than the S95. The ergonomics of the buttons and case have been improved considerably and I'm now quite happy with this camera. I was able to buy (re-buy) an S95 for $229 on Amazon when they were discounted heavily during the holidays and I'll keep that camera as a travel backup but I plan to use the S100 as my primary hiking and travel camera now, the images I'm getting from it are excellent.""
"20111211","1.0","Average image quality in an enpensive price package!","I've been playing with digital camera since 2001. I have total 2 DSLR and 2 P&S one: Canon ELPH 300, Olympus XZ-1.Bought this camera at Best Buy last week to test out and I had around 100 shots with it. My conclusion: Don't expect it deliver good image as 'sample' photos by Canon. Image is very average. In fact, my previous canon ELPH 300 gave better image results. Only in low light, Canon S100 is just a bit better than Canon ELPH 300.  Same shot at same time and place with my Olympus XZ-2, Olympus delivered way superior image....way way better. Much more clearer and detailed.Not worth the money 429.99....overpriced. If it's 200, I might keep it. Rather than that, nothing is really special about it.""
"20111209","2.0","Big disappointment","I was really excited for this camera - there are very few in this market segment, a small compact camera intended for enthusiasts. It has full manual controls and can save images in Raw format.On the plus side, the ergonomics and build quality are excellent. It was lighter than I expected, but still feels very solid, with high quality buttons and switches. The screen is big, bright, and gorgeous.Its ultimate downfall in my mind is image quality. I'm not sure if the lens on mine was bad or whatnot, but both the left and right edges were blurry in pretty much all pictures I took. This includes brain-dead easy things to shoot, like the facade of buildings in sunny conditions outdoors. On top of that, the images seem more noisy than I expected, even at the minimum ISO setting of 80.I've owned several Canon cameras over the last few years and this one is definitely a let-down in my mind. It went back to the store, and for now I'm going to keep my 1.5 year old Elph instead.*** UPDATE *** : The day after I tested the S100, I just borrowed my friend's S95 (the previous model in this line of cameras) and took the exact same test shots again. The facade of a building in the same exact conditions (clear skies, 2 hours before sunset). And I brought along my current compact, a canon SD780. The result was as expected: While not as sharp as a prime lens on an SLR, both the S95 and SD780 were reasonable shots with no obvious blurry sections. When you put them side-by-side with the S100 shots from the day before, the difference is absolutely obvious - the S100 shots look blurry to the point of being awful and almost unusable. This is not just me being a snobby camera nerd - any casual observer could see the difference quite easily.I would love to believe that I had a one-off example of a bad camera, but the DPReview preview of the S100 seems to indicate this problem is much more widespread than that. Get it together, Canon. I have been a fan of your products for many years and have never been this disappointed.""

It was a little big but the quality was great and I loved the turn wheel. The 1400 shot half-decent but still pretty good pictures and the buttons were just okay. My friend broke my 1400 so I bought myself the S100 and I have to say that I AM IN LOVE. Yes, it's a little chunky but not too big. It takes AMAZING pictures!

"20111206","5.0","A great camera, no matter what the size!","I purchased this camera in early November and have been enjoying it immensely. I owned a G11 (which I now have sold), and found that the S100 equals its image quality in good light and easily surpasses it in low light. I took both cameras out and shot the exact same scenes, then examined the images carefully to arrive at that conclusion. Here's my take on the pros and cons:PRO's- Portability - this is quite important for travelers- Bright 24mm equivalent lens- HS system really works for low/difficult lighting situations- Screen is bright and easy to use- IQ is equal to or better than what I have now- HD video is outstanding - I sold my HD camcorder, too.- Stabilization works very well, especially in low-light handheld and video modesCON's- Battery life is too short - I bought several generic spares here on Amzn- I am still getting used to its light weight- The lens is slow on the long end (f5.9 at 120mm equiv.)I have read extensively online about some people having focus issues or corner softness. I have gone back and re-checked my images and have not experienced either, but can only speak for myself. If you buy one, please put it through it's paces using different settings and conditions and closely examine your images to make sure your camera doesn't have any image issues.""

Can't Canon stick with the old RAW format and move forward?  Now I have to wait until Adobe updates their Photoshop software.  Canon does have a converter program in the box but... how do I say this... it sucks.If you only need a 'point and shoot' camera, you might want to look elsewhere.

I've taken good moonlit landscapes with an old Powershot A1100 at 15s/ISO 400 or higher; it's unbelievable that Canon's latest high-end ultracompact is a less capable night shooter than a three-year-old entry-level point-and-shoot.""
"20111203","3.0","S100 vs S95 vs S90","This review is for people who owns a S90 or S95 and is thinking about upgrading to a S100.I owned a S90 since it first debuted and have been very happy with it.  Monday I went to a local camera store and compared S95 vs S100 back to back including image quality on ISO 80 at 28mm & here is my impression: S95's image quality is noticeably superior, S100's image looks more washed out. S95's image is more consistent from center to corners but S100's image has 1 or 2 soft corners. At this focal point, S95's lens is brighter so has faster shutter speed. At ISO 800 both camera has pretty equal image quality but with such bright lens and good IS, you rarely shoot above 800 ISO. Unless you need the extra wide angle or slightly longer range I would choose S95 especially for the low price they offer. I do like the S100's better grip. I ended up taking the S95 home. I wanted to give 4 stars to the S100 but since it is 43% higher than the price of the S95 I give it a 3.Went home and compared S95 vs S90 back to back. Almost identical image quality except S95 has cleaner image processing at the darker areas due to an improve jpg processor. I also like the better ergonomics on the S95 and the price was $100 less than what I paid 1.5 year ago. Other notable improvement that was not mentioned in most reviews was there are more settings for Auto ISO: you can choose a slow ISO increase rate vs normal. In Program mode(P), the normal ISO increase rate was at 1/30' shutter speed, but under slow ISO, the threshold is now 1/15' which is very ideal for still or very slow moving objects in low light. This is just what I needed for the older S90 where under auto ISO setting, the camera wants to choose a much higher ISO than necessary thus produces poorer images, but now I just set it at slow auto ISO and let the camera choose the correct ISO.  I can also set a upper limit in addition to the auto ISO. Most of the other pros & cons are already covered by someone else so I don't need to go over them any more.""
"20111202","4.0","Can't process in photoshop (as of Dec. 2011)","Just got the S100 and still playing with it.  Picture quality and camera function seems fine to this point.  However, you can not post process the pictures in Photoshop.  I am using CS 5 and process most of my shots in camera raw.  Adobe has not yet added the S100 to their camera file.  You can not process raw or JPEG images in CS 5 at all.  I assume that means you can't process in lower versions of Photoshop as well.  Hopefully,  Adobe will update the Camera Raw processor soon and include the S100.  By the way, the Canon processing software included with the camera is LAME.Edit 12/21/11:  As several comments point out, the recent release of Raw 6.6 now allows processing of raw files in CS 5.  Turns out my inability to process Jpegs was due to my card reader.  My older card reader would not read the new SD 8GB card. My SLR's use CF and this is my first SD card camera.  An new card reader solved the problem.  Been using the camera now for few weeks.  Lots of functions, many of which I'll never use.  Picture quality is very good (but not excellent).  Color quality very good.  Sharpness, good.  Speed, very good.  Low light very good.  Noise, good to very good. Video, have not used much.  I upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars.

"20111130","2.0","Canon Blew It on the S100 !","I had high expectations, but Canon really stumbled with the S100. The new CMOS sensor, lens and Digic processing system have not added up to a better camera than the S95.  The S95 gave really nice results in terms DOF and clarity and those qualities are missing in the S100. The S95 was visible better than the standard Powershot. I find almost no difference in IQ between my SX230 and S100, both are CMOS based HS systems.Also, there seems to be highlight clipping when using the flash and skin tones look off color. Canon did improve the build quality, since the S95 had loose LCD cover panels, but the S100 has this very nasty rough texture and plastic feel. They copied the rubber hand strip on the Nikon P300. The zoom range is longer and video is better, but nothing forgives the diminished IQ in this new model, especially at this price range. Pictures in daylight are ok, but do not stand out from the rest of their HS line. It seems they focused on high ISO shooting, but sacrificed overall IQ. I recommend you look at a different camera and get the S95 while you can. They didn't update the G12, so that is another good option. Any other Canon Powershot will be as good as the S100 so save your money.""

"20111122","5.0","Seductive Little Thing","For anyone who does not think the S100 does not have much to offer over the S95 I have two words for you: '24 mm'. I have used 28mm (field of view) equivalents for quite a while now and a recent experience with a 35mm equivalent camera reminded me why. It left me wondering how people get by with such constricted fields of view - hardly anything could fit in the frame. This 24mm wide angle has opened a whole 'nother point of view! Going from a 28mm POV to 24mm is as big a step as going from 35mm to 28mm.My retired Canon SD870IS is a marvelous little wonder that was my foray back into the world of fully automatic cameras. It has served extremely well and with almost enough adjustments to do everything required of it. It is now severely battered, has a huge grey splotch on the lcd screen (known problem) but still produces excellent results. I've always looked at the S95 and thought longingly, 'If only it had a 24mm like the Panasonic LX5.' Conversely I looked at the LX5 and thought, 'If only it had HDR and was as compact as the S95.' That way I could safely justify staying away from either. Well, with the S100 Canon called my bluff!From very limited use, impressions are as follows:This camera blows the 870IS out of the water in terms of responsiveness.Every time I power up and look into the screen it is like ,'Whoa, that is a dramatic view!' That's 24mm for you..In auto mode you will almost never run out of light for a decent flash-less shot.In video mode, the 870IS would blur out when zooming in on a subject. The S100 refreshingly retains autofocus.The various scene modes are fun to play with.Cons:My hunch is that the S100 does not produce quite as vivid results as the SD870 when left to its own devices. May need to play around with it more.I preferred to take pics on my SD870 at 3MP resolution. With the S100 its either 2MP or 6MP+The zooming action is super-fast, which is not such a great thing in video mode when you want a more gradual zoom.That Canon added a 24mm to this camera is insane. It is worth ten times the paltry increase in MSRP over the S95. C'mon people, you know how exponentially valuable a wider field of view is! This camera is a classic case of 'give them an inch, they want a mile.' Canon has done a such great job of stuffing everyone's wishes into this sock that they are left digging for excuses why it does not do more. Enjoy this beauty!""

"20111119","2.0","Not there yet . . .","I've found several serious shortcomings in the S100 I received two weeks ago, not least of which is a ridiculously short battery life (8 - 12 hours with moderate usage). I'd planned to use the camera on multi-day wilderness trips, but this would require toting along several extra batteries (at $30 - $60 each!)  Also, the image quality is not what I would have expected from a $429 camera. On my unit, colors often seem dull, and the focus is uneven with distinct blurring occurring consistently in the lower right corner of images (this is particularly visible in flat, highly detailed photos shot from a parallel plane, such as lawn from about five feet overhead). And even at low ISO settings, resolution seemed no better than my three-year-old Sony DSC-W80 pocket camera. (I did check the lens for smudges or fogging, found none, but meticulously cleaned it anyway.  No improvement. Also tried a variety of settings and lighting conditions.)  The S100 does have some impressive qualities: HD video is very good, GPS works well (though I wish there were an option to choose between UTM and Lat-Lon coordinates in the display . . . and on-board mapping software would be VERY nice!), and the camera boots up really fast. It is also loaded with potentially great features (I particularly liked the function-selectable lens ring).  I think Canon got a lot of things right with this camera, but an apparent rush to market means some things got missed. I've returned my S100, but look forward to the next generation in this line.Pros: HD Video, Quick boot-up, Small size, FeaturesCons: Short battery life(!), Poorer-than-expected image quality, Uneven focus, Cost""

I'm hoping Amazon will take it back.""
"20111114","3.0","Average image quality, poor egonomics","I've owned many PowerShot cameras from Canon over the years but moved up to DSLR about two years ago.Then earlier this year, for a trip to the Bahamas, I picked up a Nikon water proof AW100 to take photos while snorkeling. But I really wanted a regular pocket camera so I waited for and order the S100 pretty close to announcement day and got it last week.The camera certainly does a lot and has a lot of easy to use menu options for customizing the camera. But at the end of the day, there are two features I look for in a camera:1. Picture Quality2. Ergonomics (control layout)Picture Quality is pretty good. Although not as high a quality as the Nikon AW100 is an apples/oranges comparison I suppose. But just point-n-shoot produces descent images but I've seen better on other cameras of this size.Night shots were very good too, but again, 'compared to what'? But what I say to people who ask 'I have yet to take a great picture with the S100'.Some new point & shot cameras are using the new style CMOS chips with the 'wires on the back' of the sensor. I used one recently (the AW100) and it is like night vs day in picture quality. The S100 uses a 'new for Canon Powershot' chip, but it is still front-wired. Not my job to write about that technology, read up on it if you're interested.Ergonomic design is where the S100 really fails. The power button, shutter release and mode Dial are not well thought out at all. The mode dial should not be where it is--it blocks access to the shutter release. This causes you to have to reach over it to take a picture--it is obviously in the way, so why not put it elsewhere, like on the top right side of the back of the camera like they've done in so many other Canon PowerShot models.If you have the camera to someone and ask them to take your picture, you have the inevitable situation where they try to press the Mode button and you have to show them where the shutter release is located.The shutter release button is difficult to find--you're body just expects it to be the dominate button on top of the camera.Next is the Flash--cool idea and looks good in a demo video on a website, however in practice in 100 percent of the cases, my left hand is holding a finger over to the top of the flash as it tries to popup. Fortunately unlike some older Canon powershots with this feature, this set of power gears is stronger--and doesn't get stripped when you do this (which you will) like some older powershots did. Where are you supposed to hold the camera?All in all, this camera is going back. If it were a $200 camera, I'd probably keep it I the glove box of my car for quick & dirty shots, but for $429 its going back to Amazon. Sorry Canon, I really wanted to like this one, but unless you're a DSLR user who for some reason demands all the controls of a DSLR in a small camera, this is just an overpriced, difficult to use model for the money.""
"20111111","5.0","Powerful point-and-shoot camera","I have been using a DSLR camera for the last few years, and finally decided that it was time to get an additional smaller camera to carry around with me.  My review will compare some aspects of the S100 with my DSLR (a Nikon D90) which may be useful for others who are considering the addition of a small pocketable camera.I have used the S100 for a few days now and am generally very impressed with the quality of the images, and the level of customization possible.  The camera offers a myriad of functions for all levels of users, giving me a level of control that is fairly close to that I'm used to from my DSLR.  The lens is also excellent - far better than that of older point-and-shoot cameras (it rivals in sharpness [but doesn't quite reach] the quality of the kit lens that came with my DSLR).  The level of noise in the images and that of the the in-camera noise reduction algorithms, are very acceptable, and reach the level of quality that is provided by my 3-year old APS-C sensor DSLR. The biggest advantage of this camera for me is, of course, the tiny size of the camera, compared to the DSLR. While my other camera has a much better display, the screen of the S100 is just fine for normal use.  I also like the availability of an online luminance histogram (projected on top of the image). The construction of the camera is very good - it seems mechanically solidly built, with the only possible exception of the covers that hide the battery and USB/HDMI connectors.I don't particularly care for the many scene and automatic modes.  These are definitely for other types of users, and it is a strength of this camera that the modes can simply be ignored if one doesn't want to use them.  Having said this, though, the HQ burst mode, the multi-shot night mode and the HDR mode will probably be interesting to me in the future (I have tried them, and found them to work nicely).  Another big attraction for me is the possibility to use RAW images from this camera - custom-adjusted RAW images can be much better than the automatically generated JPG images.  While there have been negative comments about the inclusion of GPS capabilities in this camera, I find this feature very good, and, again, it can be disabled if one doesn't want to use it.Some aspects of my experience are not as positive.  Compared to the handling of the DSLR, the ergonomics of this camera are poor (as they are for most compact point-and-shoot cameras).  Many of the more interesting functions which have dedicated buttons on most DSLRs are only reachable through menus on the S100.  Also, focusing is a very slow process, compared to the much faster DSLR phase detect AF systems. Finally, the battery life is reportedly short, but I think that I will be able to live with this quite easily.  The battery is small, so that it should not be a problem to put an extra battery in one's pocket.  The software that is supplied with the camera is ok, but clearly not well integrated.  Canon could have done much better on this front, providing a solid piece of software rather than several that don't really integrate well with each other.  Unfortunately, I had problems installing the supplied suite of programs on one of my computers for reasons that are still not quite clear to me (it worked fine on another).I give this camera five stars despite the few negative points, because most of the camera issues (with the exception of the software issue) result from the fact that the camera is optimized to be small - the issues mentioned above are basically unavoidable. I am not commenting on the video capabilities of the camera, because I have not used it yet, and will probably not use it much in the future.Overall, this is a great little camera that I will use a lot.""

"20111107","3.0","Great user interface and manual controls, average image quality.","Let me start by saying that this camera has one of the nicest designsI have seen/used on a compact camera. The size is perfect as is themenu layout and the user interface. The manual controls are great andfor the most part logical and intuitive.After using the camera for almost two weeks I got some mixed thoughts.The camera is a total joy to use and makes you wanna use the manualmodes and try different things and get creative because it makes itreally easy. Accessing things like ISO, WB, exposure compensation,bracketing, etc. is really simple and you can customize it to make itwork almost the way you want. Very cool indeed!The problem I had with the camera has more to do with image qualitythan anything else (both photos and video). I decided to give this onea try mostly based on the positive reviews and popularity of both theS95 and S90, hoping it would be a camera that would cover most ofmy photographic needs (at least on paper it was).I tested this camera along with a Sony HX9V. Have beentaking the same pictures with both, under the same light conditionsand with the closest camera settings I can use. The S100 beats theSony in most low light situations for obvious reasons (2.0 vs 3.5 maxaperture). But in almost every other situation: moderate, bright,overcast, indoors, landscape... the HX9V produces better results outthe camera without further processing. I wasn't impressed with the results of the S100 at ISOs over 400 and was especially disappointed with the auto WB results.Focusing, although fast and accurate when there's enough light available, israther slow in low light, and in many cases not able to lockfocus.The images produced by the S100 were not vibrant, sharp and detailedenough for me. They were a little on the noisy side at high ISO andthe color rendition was a little inaccurate, I'm guessing due to poor AutoWhite Balance.Video looks really nice and clear as long as you don't move thecamera. I mean, image stabilization works really well, don't take me wrong; the problem iswhen you start panning right and left, up/down that it looks reallybad. The frame rate of this camera I believe is 24fps so it's not very smooth. If you watchthe video on anything that's bigger than 20 inches, it looks so bad (the panning) thatalmost makes you dizzy.So I guess for someone who's not very concerned about photo and video quality, and is looking more for features, full manual controls, compact size and a nice user interface, this camera would be worth serious consideration. Or you can just buy a camera that will give you the same kind of JPEGs for half the price. I'm trying to get the best possible pictures without the need of much post processing (if I wanted to do that I would just shoot RAW with my DSLR).I decided to return it to BB today and will be getting the Sony NEX-5N instead. It's bigger in size but produces way better JPEGs out of the camera (some of the best I've seen) and gives me full manual controls and the option to shoot RAW if I want to. Would I sacrifice size for image quality? Absolutely. It's not a huge camera anyway. With some of the smaller lenses is not much bigger than the S100. The $270 price difference is worth from IQ point of view which is what I'm looking for.""

I tryed the S-95 great camera, but the videos was bad (no zoom or focus) the movies were more out of focus then in focus, a real deal breaker at that price. The S-100 was a night & day difference, very nice, not choppy, looked great on my 55in TV . I am sure there is a camera for every person out there, but the Canon S-100 is the camera I have picked for me & I am glad I did, the perfect camera for me.""
"20111107","5.0","Pretty sweet compact for DSLR Owners","I am a DSLR owner that doesn't always want to lug around all the equipment and this compact does all the tricks I want it to. Its very impressive for it's size and price. Recently, I had purchased the s95 and returned it when I found out this was being released.The s95 is a great camera however, I feel the s100 trumps it. The noise is greatly reduced in the s100. The built in ND filter is an amazing addition, and the extra zoom and wide angle while it doesn't seem like much, but is. I could care less about GPS but it might come in handy when I travel.All the complaints I am reading about AWB and tints seem either like a defective unit or user error. The AWB seems fine to me, and the screen is ultra crisp.If you are a quality control freak this is a great addition to your camera bag. I added two photos that show just how fantastic this little camera can be. I can not stress enough that DSLR owners will be impressed.""
"20111106","5.0","All the reasons the S90/95 was great, updated.","The bad news first, since it is short.  ISO locked at 80 for over 1 sec shutter, used for some night shots and for astronomy.  The AF, AE, and AWB problems others report I just have not seen.  Either the reviewer is not using the camera properly, or, as this is such a new model, perhaps there are some defective ones.  Canon does have a warranty.The good news is that everything is improved:1. Ergonomics - slightly thinner so it fits in the pocket easier.  Textured finish, subtle front and rear grips.  The rear control dial has been perfected.  Just the right tension, comfortable detents.2. Eye Fi support - indicates when the card is active, and doesn't power off during transfers.3. GPS - Could be useful for location or accurate time-stamps, and easy to shut off it you don't like it.4. More wide angle, more telephoto - Not a lot of extra range, but for no extra space or trade off in lens quality, it's appreciated.5. Better high ISO - At least 1 stop better than the S90.  ISO1600 is noticeably more detailed and less noisy, with S100 NR at Low (which I recommend as a default setting).  This isn't the huge improvement I was hoping for after 2 years of sensor technology, but it is less noise and more megapixels than the S90.  I miss the 'amnesty international' (candle logo) mode, but results are probably better than that mode by just using ISO6400 and brightening a stop or two afterwards.6. Movie Mode - If you had the S90, clearly you didn't care about video.  I don't, but it doesn't hurt to have it.  S100 video is great, high res and optical zoom.  Note that 6min at 720/30 will eat ~1GB.  1080 is 24fps, inconvenient for editing, but fine for grabbing frames out of that are high enough resolution to print 8x10 at 100dpi (plenty for the wall).  Somewhat makes up for the still anemic (2.3 fps) continuous shot mode (it is that slow even in M2, 2mp, mode).7. Better Image Stabilization - Not sure about vs the S95, but better compared to the S90.8. 'Other' - Several other features to play with like HDR mode, Movie Digest, aspect ratios, ND filter, that may or may not be useful.  Macro is improved, but still inconvenient compared to other cameras.  The setting, like the S90, reverts to normal on power-off.  Unlike the S90, the S100 will not focus on distant objects in macro mode.Any other negatives would be in relation to other cameras than the S90 or S95.  There are now other cameras on the market like the Olympus XZ-1 or Fuji X10 that are worth considering for low-light pocket cameras, but both are much larger than the S100.  That's the cost of having a lens that is brighter at telephoto.  Sony may be faster at low light AF.  Look at a camcorder if you want 'true' 1080/60p HD video.""
"20111106","4.0","Canon S100 vs SX230HS","I'm writing this review because these are two of the higher-end pocketable Canon cameras and you may debate between which is better for you. I've owned the S100 for 3 weeks/300 pics now and have had the SX230HS for 7 months and taken 1,000s of pictures with it.They are both great cameras and you will, no doubt, be happy with either. They both have full manual controls, shoot 1080p video, and are very similar in size.To me, there are two obvious differences that matter:1. Zoom! The SX230HS clearly wins out in the long zoom competition. 14X vs.  5X on the S100. Does this really matter? To me: not so much. In my experience, I shoot 90% of my pictures at the widest possible focal length and aperture. Even the pictures where I zoom, 5X covers just about everything else.Does this mean the 14X zoom doesn't have value? No. Some things are cool, like zooming in on the ball drop in Times Square, or reading some far away sign. Keep in mind that using that much zoom is limited to fixed subjects in very good lighting. Anything else will be blurry due to you or the subject moving during the relatively long exposure.2. ISO noise. This one is not obvious to all camera buyers yet, but once you know what it is, it becomes the most important feature. I have posted some 100% crop photos here with side by side comparisons of a ruler and a flat wall. I like this test because it shows both noise and smoothing processes that remove fine detail.So how do they compare? The S100 is much better than the SX230 as you can see from the test shots. The S100 has more detail (numbers and lines on the ruler) and less noise (splotchyness).There are purists out there that will say you can't compare the two because the S100 has a DIGIC 5 vs. the DIGIC 4 in the SX230 and they are using different noise reduction strategies. That doesn't change the fact that I greatly prefer the noise reduction on the S100 and I think the detail is retained better as well.Also aiding the S100 is a wider aperture f/2.0 vs f/3.1 (1.3 stops). This gives you the ability to use a faster shutter speed at the same ISO to reduce motion blur. Or use lower iso for less noise at the same shutter speed.Conclusion:I'll take the better noise handling over the zoom.The superior S100 Image Quality (IQ) makes this my primary camera for almost all situations now. The zoom on the SX230 just doesn't come into play enough where I would get more benefit from it over better IQ on the S100.Star rating:Why do I give it 4 start instead of 5? Cons listed by other users:Long exposures are stuck to ISO 80 and 15 seconds max, HDR needs a tripod, battery life (though I got a cheap battery on Amazon, works well).Hope this helps.""

"20111104","1.0","Green tint on LCD screen","i have the s95 and decided to get the s100.  upon comparing shots with both of them, the s100 has a greenish tint/hue to the pics.  this is even true when you do a manual white balance.  with auto white balance, you either get a greenish tint or a very yellow/brown tint when zooming in.  the s95 has a very natural real color to it, with both auto and manual white balance.  also, with the s100, even after doing a manual white balance and then manually tweaking the white balance, in the 24mm shots, there is no way to get rid of the greenish tint.  i am returning the s100.Update 11/6/11: Switched the sd card out from the s100 and put that same sd card in my s95.  no greenish tint on playback!  thus i believe that the s100 does not take pics that are greenish, just the s100 displays the greenish tint on the screen, thus my s100 screen is defective.  does anyone else have this problem?""
"20111104","5.0","Worthy Successor to S95","I had the S90 (now given away) and S95 (held tightly by my wife still).  I got the S100 for myself, as I was looking forward to the wider angle and reputedly cleaner high ISO (low light) performance.I think the image quality holds up well, which is saying a bit, since the new lens is much wider (24 vs 28) and a bit longer (120 vs 105).  I was also worried about going to a CMOS sensor, but the image quality is actually on par with the previous CCD.  When you go to higher ISO (1600 and above), the image quality is much nicer, in my opinion.  I do not use video much at all, so I cannot comment on video quality other than to repeat the newly improved specs.There are a few usability changes that I have to get used to.  They changed the button layout, and as a non-video user, the dedicated movie button is a waste for me.  I preferred not having to hit the up button before using the expousure compensations, which you now need to do.  The battery life seems a bit shorter (some report it getting better as the battery chip learns it capacity), and I wish it used the same battery as the S95.  Canon also oddly chose to limit ISO to 80 when setting shutter speed over 1 second (it forces it down from any higher ISO).  Granted most people do not do that, but is is an odd limitation to implement.I saw in some reviews here people had issues with white balance.  I have not had any, and it does not seem to be a common complaint on DPReview, where the early adopters hang out.  Some reported problems with close-up focusing, but as many times as I have seen this, at least half look like inexperienced camera users or poorly arranged tests.  I personally have not had the problem.  If you go there, look for posts by the user 'gail.'  She has used the camera extensively and also has a good website.Overall, I am happy with the purchase (two weeks ago), and will be holding onto the camera.""
"20111103","5.0","A real gem with a weak screen monitor","I got this gem at Best Buy, my first impression after comparing to my S95 wasn't that impress. I was comparing them side by side; s95 color was very well saturated and just awesome vs the s100 screen was just look washed out (lots of blue cast). After about 1000 shots trying different mode I'm about to give up on this bad boy. I'm about to head back to Best Buy and return this one and hold on to my S95. Just couple hours before the store open, I decided to give this bad boy the last chance. I loaded the photos of the s95 and the s100 in my computer and compared them on my  Eizo ColorEdge CG243W 24.1' Widescreen LCD Display. And boys I was just in shock. The photo from the photos from the S100 are just blowing my mind. Talking about near SLR quality  very close to my 50D with 15-85mm IS) awesome dynamic range wow wow !!! the s95 photos are beautiful but no comparison to the s100. I have a felling that the new CMOS sensor is just too powerful for the S100 screen to handle (may be Canon will release a new firm ware to correct this problem).  Beautiful photo with the latest technology !!!!!!!!. A keeper !!!! I sold my s95 !!!""
"20111103","5.0","Excellent Point and Shoot and Worthy Successor to S95","At the time of this writing the S100 was just released. I recently bought the S95 on the recommendation of a friend who is an avid photographer, thinking the S100 would not be released until much later. The S100 just started showing up in stores so I bought it as well, intending to return one of the cameras. So I had the opportunity to compare them both!To preface, I'm an intermediate level photographer, and it is just a hobby. I do own a DSLR, but it is one of the lower end models in the DSLR world. Still, I have become comfortable with manual adjustments and own a few lenses for it. However the majority of my pictures end up being taken with the camera most conveniently at hand (iPhone), and in this case I was looking for something that could offer a big step up in image quality without having to carry the larger DSLR.Both the S95 and S100 are excellent cameras. However, there are key points about the S100 that give it the advantage. The rubber grips on the front and back are excellent. The flash pops up on both the S95/S100 where you would naturally place your left hand. Having the rubber grips for your right hand allows this to be a one-handed camera, or at least allows better support with the right hand since the left hand may not be able to rest where it feels most natural, which for me tends to involve a finger resting on top of the flash. This is an issue for both the S95 and S100, but the S100 mitigates it by having better support for the right hand - the rubber grips and better shutter button position. More on that next.The shutter button is larger on the S100. This feels more natural and easier to access. Also the position of the shutter button has been moved more towards the right edge. It may seem small but this is a big improvement. If you have shorter fingers you may find it more difficult to naturally reach the shutter button on the S95 than the S100. The shutter button on the S95 is just a bit too far from the right edge for my taste, making it a bit difficult to reach when bending your shooting finger to press the button. Canon certainly recognized that as evidenced by the new location of the shutter button on the S100.The buttons on the rear of the camera have been changed, including having a single-press button to start shooting a video. This is great since most videos for me involve catching fleeting moments of my kids in action. On the S95 you need to turn the mode selection dial to movie mode first. Regarding video, the S100 also allows zooming in/out while shooting a movie. As I understand it, the S95 did not allow that.The processor has been upgraded and the S100 does feel slightly faster because of it when navigating through menus.I took comparison shots in my home using both cameras and I found a slight advantage for the S100 in terms of image quality. There was a bit more detail using the S100, but honestly it wasn't significant. Still, in my head-to-head tests the S100 was the winner.For me the main difference is in terms of the user interface. The button layout is better on the S100 and the addition of the grips is helpful. This camera feels easier to shoot because of this. This may seem small, but all of these button layout changes and grip additions add up to a camera that overall is more convenient for me to shoot. That's why I chose the S100. This is, after all, my camera of convenience.The only downside I found for the S100 is that it is priced higher than the S95.If you are on a budget and tried the S95 and like how it feels, then get it. You will be very happy with it! The pictures were very similar in quality between the two, and the S95 is a high quality camera. Everything about it mechanically boasts of durability and quality. But if the price difference is not an issue then I recommend the S100.""
"20111103","1.0","Very bad image quality","Got my Canon S100 four days ago. Kind of the purchase inspired by my roommate... I intended to buy a Canon ELH300, but I was told that S100 has a much bigger sensor and produces high-quality image. But in fact it does NOT! I took several test shots yesterday on a trip to Springfield, IL. The image quality is so bad.... I could not believe that Canon has made such a horrible product....""
"20111103","2.0","Don't buy S100 if you have S95","I bought this S100 very early, around Oct 21 @ the local bestbuy. I was quite excited to be the 'early bird', yet I soon started to realize that I had made a terrible mistake purchasing it....I took this S100 along with the S95 and T3i for six field trips. Very frankly, I was SOOOOO disappointed with Canon at their inability to compete w/ the Nikon new series. It's quite obvious that Canon released this S100 in a hesitation!On one hand, it has to bring up sth to compete with Nikon, Sony, and other brands. On the other hand, Canon knows for sure that S100 has made so many trade-offs from the very beginning, which makes this camera a very bad choice for people who have been using S95 for quite a time.Here as below are my own experience:Pros - Unlike some people who claimed that the shooting speed is slow, I don't have any problem on this. I think the shooting speed is a bit faster than S95. But this won't make too much difference. Another great things are of course the GPS function and the 1080P video. Honestly, without these two functions, S100 is in NO WAY comparable to S95!!!Cons - Under auto modes, I found it sometimes hard to focus. And sometimes it took almost 5 seconds to focus yet with wrong objects..... So frustrated..... Second, under low light condition, the f/2.0 is not nearly powerful as it was supposed to be compared with S95. The picture I obtained was dark and orange rather than the bright and true-color ones produced by S95. Third, when you use manual settings, the ISO range is limited from 80, which is so unbelievable!! You may check reviews @ other major forums. People are reporting the same thing.... Can't believe this....Anyway, in general, I think S100 is kind of the trade-off product Canon has made. And it is definitely not a good one. It has some fansy functions, but who care??! The quality of the image is vital!!! And at the end of the day, I don't care if I have GPS or 1080P. I want quality of the image!!I just returned my S100 to bestbuy today by the end of their 14-day return policy. It was such an unpleasant experience.....""
"20111103","5.0","Super improvement on an already great camera","Have had the new S100 for a week now, have taken about 1000 shots in all conditions (day, night, low light, high light) and I have to say that this camera is just about perfect. Shots are sharp, clear, very little distortion across the range. The additional zoom range is a nice addition.I read a few of the other reviews that disparage the camera, but I think it might be sample error and they should have tried at least another unit before posting bad feedback. I haven't experienced ANY of the problems they describe --THe white balance works great; there is next to no distortion at 24mm wide; there is no color casting in night shots; there haven't been any 'lens errors'.  The camera shoots quickly with virtually no lagtime. All of the features work well -- and the slight redesign of the buttons makes it easier to use the camera. Th front grip feels comfortable.  I can't comment on problems with Raw recording, because I do not shoot in Raw.I loved the older s95 -- I chose it in the longterm over the Panasonic LX5 because of some of the additional features and the small compact size that fits in a pants pocket. But I can honestly say that the s100 is even better. (See my review of the S95 for that cameras features). I don't hesitate recommending this camera.""
"20111103","3.0","A disappointing change from the s95, still a solid camera","This camera, in my opinion, isn't nearly as good as the s95. However, it does have its positives, namely its user interface, wide angle lens and aesthetics.A very surprising positive for this item, is the user interface, specifically the button layout on the back of the unit. Canon reduced the total number of buttons and moved them around. Shockingly, I immediately adjusted to the new layout and found it very hard to return the unit, mostly due to the buttons' ease. After years of Canon's old layout, I am still amazed that I adjusted in less than a week to the new layout.The unit also features a rear thumb rest and front grip, combined with a less slick and more textured finish, the unit feels much better in your hand than the s95 ever did.The s100 features a 24mm lens vs. the 28mm lens of the s95. That is a huge improvement in wide angle shooting and creating more life-like scenes.Unfortunately, that's where the good ends on this camera. For me, the biggest issue is the awful white balance of this unit. As we all know, a big selling point of this point and shoot, is the 'bright' f/2.0 aperture lens. The s95 absolutely excels in low light shots, creating nearly 'professional' quality photos. I took a series of low/ambient light shots with both cameras on the same settings, under the same conditions and the results were absolutely night and day. The shots with the s95 came out bright and light, the s100 shots came out orange and dark. With a huge adjustment to the white balance, the s100 shots looked ALMOST as good as the s95 shots. When viewed on a monitor at 100% the shots lost a large amount of clarity and contrast.Canon 'upgraded' the CCD sensor of the s95 to a CMOS sensor. Apparently they've never heard the phrase 'if it's not broken, don't fix it.' Also, if you zoom to 28mm, the aperture goes to f/2.2, which is 'dimmer' than the s95 at 28mm.With these gripes aside, the s100 is still a solid performer. It just isn't an improvement over the s95. The bottom line is that the aesthetic improvements and wide angle lens do not make up for the white balance/darkness issues when shooting in low/ambient light. Canon, you messed up on this one.""
"20111103","1.0","A downgrade from the S95!","If only they had kept the CCD sensor and not gone the CMOS route! CMOS only has an advantage in DSLRs with much larger sensors. The images are MUCH blurrier than those from the s95. I primarily use the 24mm wide-angle; the extra zoom means nothing, and the GPS (plotted pics on google earth) accuracy is not even close to accurate, but sure does chew up the battery!How about a real upgrade Canon? 12.1 MP are NOT necessary, and are probably behind causing the lower quality! Keep it at 10 please!""
"20111102","5.0","Great little camera!","It's delightfully small and pocketable. It readily fits in a jeans pocket, without the protruding lens that is a problem for many small cameras. Image Quality is very good, and it is perhaps one stop better at high ISOs than the S95.  But despite Canon's hype, it isn't magically better, and in poor lighting will be outperformed by most any SLR camera. That isn't the S100's fault, it goes with having a small sensor.  I find ISO 2000 usable for most purposes, but it depends on your tolerance for image noise.Key strengths are the ability to pick your most used menu functions and put them in a shortlist of favorites, an even faster way of accessing one key function by assigning it to a handy ring around the lens, good low light performance, and most of all the small, handy size.No real weak points beyond those unavoidable in a small digicam, though I am not impressed with the battery life, claimed to be about 200 shots. I haven't rigorously checked that claim, but it is reasonable based on my experience so far. Not really a weak point,  but note that the claimed fast f/2 is available only at the widest focal length. By the time you zoom out to 120mm, you are at f/5.9.  Again, it is a physical limitation of having such a small camera.Pricey, but worth it to have a super small camera with good image quality, and the ability to override the excellent automatic modes to control things yourself if desired.""

They are unretouched, except for the Northern Lights, where I bumped up the levels: another drawback is that 1) maximum exposure is 15 seconds and 2) long exposures are limited to ISO 80, even though its noise levels are good (even ISO 800 is decent, and 400 is perfectly usable)Here are sample pictures from said vacation:  [...]Pros:- Great image quality, even indoors / low light- GPS- SmallCons:- Mediocre battery life- Limited long exposure""

So, without playing much with the S100 myself, I hand over the camera to my mom, and expect her to be able to take great pictures by herself as I have done with my S95 in my daughter's birthday party -- indoor.First shot, auto mode, flash pops up, click, picture over-exposed. My first though was that my mom's hand must be blocking the exposure light sensor. So, try again. Still over-exposed! Ok, this time I try it myself, over-exposed. Hmmm..., 4 feet away from the subject might be a little too close. OK, try again. 3 meter away, what!!! Over-exposed again! Luckily, I still brings my S95 (wife use) and D300 (I use).Go home. I looked up all settings under auto mode. There is no control for exposure under auto mode. Ok, how about flash? There is red-eye correction and red-eye lamp. The point is, there is no control for flash intensity. I take a snap of my living room. Again, flash pops up and picture over-exposed -- this time, it's at least 3 stops over the correct exposure. I bring out my S95 to compare -- same auto mode settings, flash pops up, click, and picture looks great! I can't believe it! This is the most basic function that must work! Let me try again... in 'P' mode everything was default (after a 'reset all') -- set to auto flash, half click, flash pops up, full click, flash fired, picture looks great!Ok, so it's at least not a hardware bug in Canon's part -- the flash intensity did not stuck at high, but is that good enough? No way! How can Canon let this basic function slip through quality control?Luckily, Amazon has great return policy. S100 is going back to Canon. I'm eying at Nikon P310 now, anybody?Potential buyers beware!""

The larger sensor in this camera allows me to print out 20 inch prints with very good quality. Without the bigger sensor, I couldn't print larger than 12-14 inch. It is easy to take a quick picture alomg the streets and cobblestones and be able frame and trim the picture and still get very good prints. The RAW lets me adjust the lighting and saturations and contrasts after I get home. It is really the only real camera the is easy to carry and take out of you pocket. It is quick to start up and take a quick shot when you need it. I bought an extra battery and am comfortable being able to shoot 100-180 phots a day. The camera allows for good pictures from a novice and customizable in many ways for the more advanced. The learning curve is a bit steep for a few days. My only complaint is that a manual is on the included install cd, but no print version which is sometimes necessary. I called Canon and they were kind enough to send a printed version by FEDEX, but it is 8 1/2 by 11. It is 236 pages and to big to travel with usually. I am writing Canon to tell them it is a big problem for me and to supply one like they have for every Canon I bought. They should at least offer it for a small fee. 1 star off for that.""

"20120521","5.0","Point and Shoot for Amateur and Professional Photographers Alike","This is an excellent camera. Don't let the size fool you, it has just about all the features of an entry level DSLR and then some. Full control over ISO, aperture, shutter speed, focus, etc. It shoots in JPG, RAW and RAW + JPG, great for those of you who like to post process. It has a ton of nifty modes that I don't use all too often seeing as how it will only give you a jpg version, but I have a fondness for the color select mode (which does work when shooting 1080p video).There are only a few things that I don't like about the camera. First is the battery life; it doesn't last that long. If you're getting this camera it means that you want a pocketable powerhouse or you have a lot of money for a point and shoot that you'll use rarely. If you're the former, make sure you pick up an extra batter or two. I can easily go through 2 a day and was relieved that I had a third so I wouldn't have to stop taking pictures. The second con is that you have to wait for your image to write to the SD card before you can take another. Make sure you pick up a class 10 card; you do NOT want that to be your bottleneck.I've been told that a lot of professional photographers use this as a backup and I can see why. This thing fits in your pocket and you can take it everywhere. The images you get are exceptional and it gives you all the flexibility you need to capture the image. It's an expensive camera for a point and shoot, but its price matches the features. The best camera is the one you have with you. Thanks to Canon, I have this with me all the time.""

Not so...Yes, it would be a very good point & shoot camera if it was available for less than $400.00.I pushed mine towards 1000 shots and most were slow (yes, I used a EXTREME card) but the worst feature is the pop-up flash.  You have to be so careful not to have your hand or finger over that area of the camera.  In fact, I had to disable the flash to cease it.  This isn't only a uncomfortable situation but with your finger or hand over the pop-up flash, it feels as though it is stripping the gears of the flash.It's just fair on colors; slow to focus and slow to process.""
"20120520","1.0","Don't buy","I liked the camera very much but now afer 4 month - lens error.Hunderts of reported same Lens problems. But the major problem is when you sent the S100 to the service they will repair this lens error but as much reported more problems after repairing. Dirty senor and lenses, sharpness gone. pic quality down.wft has Canon done! Tsunami disaster?""
"20120514","5.0","DSLR quality in a point and shoot","There's not much to be said about this camera that hasn't already been said, great clarity, excellent colors, low noise, the list goes on and on.  What really sets this camera apart is that it offers up useable manual controls in a point and shoot body.  The front control ring combined with the rear jog dial make manual mode a snap to use.  Other cameras may offer up an equally impressive array of manual settings, but no other compact camera makes those settings as easy to access and control as the s100.I definitely recommend that you buy a FAST SD card.  I purchased a SanDisk 64GB SDXC class 10 card.  With a slower card, even a class 6, there is a noticeable slowdown in continuous shooting mode.  An extra battery doesn't hurt either, especially if you want to use the GPS tagging.  I also snagged the PSC-900 case to keep the camera safe in transit, as well as a skin for the rear display from bestskinsever.com (s95 skin is compatible) to keep the display scratch free when it's out of the case.Canon does have a firmware update released for this camera, but my unit, purchased May 2012, did not require the firmware update.  More details can be found on Canon's website.All in all, this camera is worth every penny if you're a shooter that wants a compact carry-anywhere type of camera that is a breeze to use in manual mode.""
"20120510","3.0","Lens Error after just one week","Just one week after I received this camera while on a vacation, it already died of the dreaded 'Lens Error'.  I was using this camera normally in an indoor environment, with no sudden temperature change nor any physical shock, and all of a sudden when I tried to power it up again the lens would not extend out and it just showed a message 'Lens Error; Will shut down automatically; Restart camera', then turned itself off.  If I pressed the play button then I was able to turn it on in play mode and look at the pictures that I've taken, but if I tried to turn it into camera mode then the same thing would happen.  No luck with removing the battery and restarting.  I decided to just return it.  I may try my luck again and purchase one later because the image quality and features are really great.  Hopefully Canon will have this design/manufacturing flaw fixed soon.  By the way my daughter's S95 also got a 'Lens Error' a few months back.  Fortunately it was still within the warranty period and Canon fixed it.I once tried to use the GPS logger function but it drained the battery in just over half a day, so it is really useless if you are on a tour going to difference places in the day because even if you carry a spare battery you just don't know when the battery was dead unless you constantly check it.I would have had given it 5 stars if not for such a poor reliability.  And I still think this camera is worth buying just for the excellent picture quality. But you'd better be prepared for the poor reliability and have a spare camera when you are on a vacation or some other occasions which you don't want to miss.""
"20120508","1.0","WARNING:  Canon S100 Major Malfunction","I got my Canon S100 a couple of months ago in anticipation of shooting RAW while on vacation. I had 427 shots off of this camera prior to the vacation. Everything was functioning as expected. The images that it produced were spectacular (for a pocket cam of course)While on vacation I got off exactly six shots. When I turned it on again the LCD screen was black but all of the icons were functioning as normal. The camera acted as if it was fine, but upon review of photographs taken the first six were fine but anything taken after the LCD went black were blank. The only noticeable thing was that the focus beep was now taking a long time to occur. I tried every setting. I reset to factory, and nothing worked. I tried video; nothing.  I switched out the SD card.  I switched out the battery.  No better results.The camera wasn't jarred, didn't get wet, or was subjected to anything other than setting it down on the hotel nightstand that evening.Luckily I had taken a camera that I bought for last years vacation; a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7. I lost one complete day of expected shooting on Culebra Island, Puerto Rico due to the fact that I hadn't packed the Panasonic for that days trip. Bummer. The S100 worked the night before so I hadn't even given it a thought.When I got home a couple of days ago I put the SD card in my computer, and as expected, the first six shots were fine and the rest are big black rectangles.This morning I went to CanonUSA's website and went through the warranty repair section and obtained a work order number. I will send the camera out tomorrow for repair or replacement.I don't know if I could ever trust this camera again, even after repair. I haven't seen anything mentioned about this problem. If it is a known issue with these cameras, I didn't see it when I researched this particular model.Anything can malfunction, but these cameras are NOT cheap, and I expected better than I received.I have been an Amazon Prime Customer for years and have purchased hundreds of items and have never written a review before, but the performance of this particular camera let me down that much.""
"20120507","1.0","Not worth the money","Simply do not expect DSLR performance from this Camera although the price is almost the same. I took over 1500 pictures for over a month and half and had no option but to return it since there was no justification for the price. Here are some basic drawbacks: There is no option to have flash on! The auto mode does not use flash when it is suppose to. The FPS (if you can call it that) is almost as slow is my 880DS from 3 years ago (over a second, too late for me). Not to mention that at least 1/3 of the pictures come out blurry when on the auto setting. Include the orange affect of the flash and I can't see possibly why you would keep this camera over cheaper options that perform the same. Or even better, get a Nikond3100 for 100 more or brand new d3200 for 300 more and have a real amazing but relatively cheap (SLR) camera.Good luck!""
"20120504","5.0","Canon Point & Shoots For Me From Now On!!","I used to shoot Nikon professional equipment for years and have always known the Canon P&S cameras were really good. After some convincing from a friend who still shoots professionally, I purchased the S100. I won't go into much detail because there are already a number of good reviews, but this camera is a rock star!!You won't be disappointed. The color and clarity of the images is better than any I have personally seen from a P&S.Manual control is great for those who want to manipulate exposure, shutter speed and light settings.  This is also great for those who'd want to experiment changing the look of photos.The battery lasts a surprisingly long time.It's on in seconds!The video record button is very handy when you're trying to capture special moments. I've used it several times to film my 16-month old daughter when she is doing something new. (You don't have to switch modes to shoot video. Just push the red record button on the back of the camera and you're shooting video.)It may seem a little spendy to some, but this is a point & shoot towards the top end of the market. Many Canon pros store this exact camera in their pockets when lugging gear around isn't necessary.""
"20120503","5.0","Found a keeper and LOVE it!!","I finally found a keeper S100 in 'champagne silver' and love it.  I tried at least 3 (three) S100's and the annoying clicking sound in the video was driving me crazy.  I called Canon tech support who said they were unaware of any video clicking issues (NOT)!!  They had me turn off the IS as well as other things and the clicking was still there.  They simply said 'well it's a small camera so that's to be expected).  My Elph 300HS and SX230 are small, too but there's no clicking sound during the video playback.It's really worth your while if you have to try a few to find one you like.  I am still a Canon fan when it comes to point and shoot digital cameras....now if I could only find an SX260 without that annoying squeal, then I'll be even more happy!!Good luck out there Canon fans!!""
"20120502","5.0","amazing little camera!","I own two Nikon DSLRs and simply wanted a decent pocket sized P&S digital for those moments when lugging extra equipment just isn't appropriate.  I received this little gem (w/extra battery) yesterday by way of Amazon/Prime and have been thoroughly entertained by what this camera is capable of.  The faster f/2.0 and 24mm wide angle lens are two features that initially attracted me to this camera, both quite impressive.  Manual control is a huge plus.  I found the customizable Control Ring to be very handy and overall camera adjustments intuitive.The battery life, however, leaves much to be desired, though considering all that this camera can do, it's nice to know the charger (w/flip plug) is very compact and travel worthy.  The lack in HDR auto-alignment is a little disappointing, yet I'm sure the AEB set to -2/0/+2 with Photomatix will do just fine.  I don't like using flash but 'if' I absolutely need it, I have flash exposure compensation set to -2/3ev to soften the (harsh) effects.FYI, if anyone is as irritated as I am that for the price of this camera, the only reference to the actual 'Camera User Guide' (236 pages!) is a lousy .pdf file on an enclosed CD, then order a printed & bound hardcopy through Manualsink.com for less than $20.  Nice for quick cross-referencing and identifying Canon icons.  The Menu charts/displays towards the back alone are well worth the price.I'm currently looking into the WP-DC43 underwater housing case for this camera.  :)""
"20120427","5.0","Great camera; here's how to fix a broken screen!","I won't try to add to the reviews here, except to say that this remains the King of Truly Pocketable Cameras.My wife loves the one I bought her, but it took a spill.  This cracked the screen, though everything else is perfect.  Frustrated by this, I began looking online.First, there are many videos that detail how to replace the screen on this series of camera.  Here is one good example; though it's for the S95 I believe the disassembly sequence is the same: [...]Second, the part number for the S100 replacement screen is CM1-7245-000.  Canon Parts can be reached at 800-258-0900 or 866-481-2569.The total cost for the screen, with tax and shipping, was under $40.  For me, getting this directly from Canon was a far better deal than attempting to get the right thing from an eBay seller.I hope this helps anyone else who'd suffered the agony of Cracked Screen Syndrome!""
"20120426","5.0","great  small camera","I ordered the s100 expecting a small camera with manual control that would deliver satisfactory images. My expectations have been met. This is my carry nearly everywhere camera, running, traveling, sitting in a coffee bistro - its close at hand.For photojournalism i use a canon 1Dmk2, for other images a 5D, both great cameras, however neither slips into a pocket or small bag.""
"20120425","1.0","defective","Bought this camera as an upgrade to a Canon 850IS.  Main camera is 5d mkII.  Found that S100 took very good movies.  Took good low light pictures.  Colors are good.  In some ways camera is superior to 5d mkii, much lighter, it does do a good job overall as a point and shoot.  Normal problems with little lens and clarity of pictures, poor detail etc.  But the biggest problem is that it stopped working.  On an extended trip overseas, the lens locked in an extended position and there is some kind of lens error.  Bugger.  Now using the old 850IS, but it is not as good as S100.  Took the S100 to Hong Kong Canon repair center, and they said since camera had a US warranty, they couldn't honor the warranty, and it would take 5 days to fix it, if I wanted to pay for it.So, don't know what the deal is, but many copies seem to have this same problem.  I would not buy it again.""
"20120423","4.0","Actually 4.5 stars for a compact","As a long time user of Canon cameras, presently the 50D DSLR and the G10 compact, I bought the S100 as a camera I'd carry in my shirt or trousers pocket, taking it everywhere.Image quality is little short of amazing for such a small unit. I think that even at base ISO, the S100's detail rendition is as good as that of my G10 (which is almost as good as the excellent 50D DSLR). In that regard, it's wonderful, capable of taking images which very few could tell were taken by a small sensor camera.Performance at higher ISOs is also surprisingly good, far surpassing that of the G10. Up to ISO 400, image noise is no problem unless one wants to make a moderately large print, 12X18 inches or more. Even then (at 400) a modest touch of noise reduction preserves all the detail while eliminating visible noise. At ISO 1000 or 1250, very good images are obtainable, when noise reduction is applied. At 1600 and above, color rendition drops off and noise becomes a problem for anything more than small web displays.There have been a few mild criticisms of the ergonomics of the S100, but I think those criticisms are probably the result of people trying to use it for an hour or so and finding the interface slightly different. After using the camera for a day or two, one almost never needs to access the menus. Aperture, shutter speed, ISO, white balance, and exposure comensation can be set so they're 'right out in the open' for the photographer who needs to change something quickly during a shoot. Even with my XL size hands, using the camera is easy and comfortable.For me, the S100 is not really a 'shirt pocket compact', and it's only a 'trousers pocket compact' if the trousers are pretty large, with roomy pockets. But it is small, and it rides comfortably in a small Sony camera case, looped onto my belt.The S100's limitations probably would not be noticed by a casual family photographer. Focus is not as rapid as it is with a DSLR. Shutter lag is noticeable, even with pre-focus. Dynamic range isn't as broad as that of a large sensor camera. These are limitations common to almost all small sensor cameras.Finally, there's no 'hot shoe' which could accomodate an external flash unit, and the camera's small built-in flash is of very limited use. The workaround is to use an external flash as a slave unit, but that does complicate things a little.There is no perfect camera,but for a small, very portable camera, it's almost impossible to beat the S100.""
"20120421","3.0","Improve over S95 in low light and video but also have more issues","I had S95 and did some comparison.I wish I can said is a lot better, but reality is 2 steps forward and 1 step backward.2 step forward are the new cmos sensor and digi 5 help the camera achieve very good low light indoor image and video is capable of 1080p with auto focus and can zoom however is not with issues. Discuss that later.  The camera start up is fast seem to be faster than s95. Focus shot to shot is also improvement but could had been better.  In s95 i can't use iso more than 400 it cause too much noise, but with s100 i can use iso 1600 still pretty good, pcmag said s100 can use up to iso 2000. Which I can is probably true. Is best in class for the iso test.  Video is excellent. Soem of the video in outdoor can match quality of those mirror less camera with their kit lens. S100 can beat mirror less camera in low light with their kit lens, is not fair comparison, but most people buy mirror less don't want to buy pancake since cost as much as this camera. The gps function is good but canon picture software doesn't do geotag automatic for you, just gave u the gps info is up to to use it, upload to site like flixr or picasa instead. S100 has better grip support than s95.  the silver color of s100 really stand out better than black one, the battery in the s100 is made in japan, s95 battery is made in china.The issue with this camera is the shuttle lag freeze at some of the shots, usually during hot weather like 90 degree after you take like 50 shots in 30 minutes time frame, the camera will sometime freeze for few seconds before you can take another shots, is annoying i do not expect such issue with s95, the sensor or chip in s100 is hotter than s95, cause i do felt the camera is warmer after some use.Another annoying problem is the video focus usually during low light, u can easily hear the focus noise . Not too loud but is noticible, is the only p&s with this sensor has this problem, other camera has to be like m4/3 sensor or larger to hear such noise.  the auto iso in long expose is limited to 80 only, not usefull. Typical auto iso only goes up to 1600. the HDR and night handle mode is useless without tripod. sony camera hdr can use it without tripod as well as night handle mode.  How can canon call hand handle mode if you still need tripod. Also no panorama mode, canon is the only major camera brand doesn't offer that feature only assist you mode.  You must buy spare battery for this camera, just get the after market one only like $15 or less, you might need 2-3 if you gonna shoot more than 400 photos without charging.  Gps on does eat you battery and take 1 to 3 minute to find the position.Bottom nice this camera does 2 part very well better than other in the same class such image and video, but function and having some issue first of its kind in the class can be annoying and cause you to miss the shot so tradeoff is there. you need to had patient and good hand to use this camera3It seem after my long complain of this camera why I still gave 4 out 5, fact is still gave you such good image and video is hard to complain the 2 major factor what you need the camera, yes sony and Panasonic and other gave you far more feature, canon often gave you the least feature for the $ but usually best in image. Unless panasonic came out new lx with 1080p 60fps and smaller is hard to beat this camera. Wish many of issue will get fix in future patch.""

Went big with camera buying the largest storage I could for trip to Europe ( two(2) Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Cards and two(2) extra batteries) So...3K pictures later, I tried to download the pic's to my computer.  Every time I followed the directions and every time the camera would indicate 'Communications Error'. Called the support number (BTW:they don't work weekend) and got the usual: 'Did you try another computer?' Yes. 'Did you try another cable?' Yes...'We are sorry, but you must send it to a repair facility'Well here is why customer support is worthless. After unloading the pictures via the flash reader on my laptop, I deleted all the pictures on the flash and reinstalled it in the camera.  Just for drill, I decided to see if it would work with the USB after deleting all the pictures. BANG!  It worked, windows loaded the USB drivers and and it worked like a charm.  After a little experimentation, I discovered that the camera communication software stops working somewhere around 1K pictures.  Anything more and you get the 'Communication Error' message and it doesn't work.  So bottom line is the camera is great. Pictures and movies: outstanding. The bad:  Without GPS on, very short battery life, with GPS on, very very short battery life (Buy extra batteries $12). Of course, the USB communications doesn't work when you have more than 1K of pictures on a flash drive.Would I buy it again with those limitations? You bet! The Camera Rocks.""

It worked for one day, then the lens error came back 100% of the time, worse than ever.  I sent it back asking for a new one, but the Canon rep said that they had to look at it first.

"20120414","3.0","Video Shortcoming","Several excellent comprehensive reviews have already been posted on the S100.  I did want to point out one shortcoming:  in video mode, the sound of the lens autofocusing is recorded.  You will hear the rapid fire clicking noise of the auto focus motor several times per second upon playback during quiet scenes.  The sound is subtle but noticeable during quiet scenes.  The sound is not noticeable while people are talking, or music is playing, or there is background noise. Whether or not you can live with the autofocus motor noise is strictly a matter of personal preference.  It is not a deal killer for what is otherwise a very nifty little camera.""

It is compact and easy to carry.  The recommended Case Logic case is a perfect fit for this camera and is padded to provide protection against damage to the camera.  I take great HD video.  The recommended 16 GB card is more room that I need for the way I use this camera.  If this was going to be my main camera and get lots of use in one shooting, I would defiantly order a second battery.

The quality of the photos were better, but still not as sharp as I wanted them to be.This week I purchased the Canon PowerShot S100, and I LOVE it.Crystal clear photos, which is what I need.  Getting used to the functions, but I am a quick learner.The only thing that I like about the 500HS better than the S100 is the high speed burst function.  The 500HS will take as many photos as you hold down the shutter. The S100 will only take up to 8 photos at a time.That is not really a deal breaker considering the quality of the photos that I am getting with the S100.I have taken at least 5000 photos with the 500HS, and I could live with quality of the photos if there were no other options.The quality of the photos will always be the bigger factor.  I am sure that a small camera like a Leica could take better photos, but that is out of my budget.I don't want to carry a camera as big a DSLR anymore.  I carried my Canon F-1 every day for about 15 years, and I just got tired of carrying the camera, film, batteries, lenses, flash, etc.The Canon PowerShot S100 does almost everything that I want it to.  I can live with the limitations that I could get from a DSLR.This Canon PowerShot S100 is a keeper for me. Hopefully I won't get the dreaded 'lens error' that I have read about from other posts.""
"20120406","5.0","great small camera","I am a semi pro photographer (stock photography) with a Canon 5D and a nice collection of L lenses.  This little camera is of course not as good as that settup but is very good none the less.  Because of it's small size it can be easily carried in a front pocket, thus getting far more use with greater convenience compared the 16 pounds of gear I usually carry around ( that heavy gear is staying locked in the safe more and more since I started using the s100).The things I really like- small, RAW capable, decent video, good zoom, decent image quality and size (iStockphoto accepts shots with this camera all the time for me and they can be extra large), inconspicuous for more candid editorial shooting and simple family photos.Many mention the battery life problem, so far, no issue for me, but I charge it before each use as instructed.  I have only needed to put in my extra battery once and that was on a 10 degree day skiing.Any noise or quality issues are easily taken care of in Lightroom.""
"20120405","2.0","Completely Unimpressed.","I've owned a string of Kodak point and shoot digital cameras over the last 12 or so years. Stepped up to a Canon T2i last year and loved it, bought a few lense for it. The last Kodak compact I bought about two years ago was a functional nightmare so I decided to 'upgrade' to this.Indoor light has to be perfect in point and shoot mode or you are going to end up with some really poor photos. I can't believe how poor of an indoor photo it takes for $400+. Colors are washed out and completely un natural or the flash just overwhelms. I find myself using the camera on my HTC android phone for indoor shots if I have a choice between the two, sad. I know a little about manual settings from having used my T2i for a year but I can not find a setting that will take a decent photo with this camera indoors.GPS is nice but if you leave GPS mode on, even with the camera off the battery will be dead in about two hours.After owning this camera for four months would I buy it if I had to do it all over again - no way. This is my first negative review on Amazon since joining in 15 plus years, not that this has anything to do with Amazon. I'm writing it as a warning, I am really disappointed in this camera. I will probably go back to using my 5 year old metal body Kodak compact point and shoot with Carl Zeiss lense.""

The screen did not work at all on the first one I bought. I returned that and bought another one from Amazon only to have the screen develop fine vertical lines across the front after using the camera for a few days.These cameras were back ordered due to flooding in Thailand that affected their manufacture. I wonder if Canon switched to a less competent manufacturer as a result. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to replace this 2nd camera...""
"20120404","4.0","I own both S100 and S95, both are great.","I have both the S95 and the S100.  I see a lot of disappointed reviews in the S100 but I think it's more to do with the fact that there really isn't much of an upgrade from the S95 than lack of quality in the s100.  I have taken literally thousands of pictures with each camera, and they are both great.  I think the S95 takes certain pictures a bit better than the S100, but also the S100 takes certain pictures better than the S95.The S100 also has the separate video record button which is a nice feature, as well as the GPS feature.  The S100 has a slightly better zoom which is also nice.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c i really was expecting it to be noticeably better than the S95 and it wasn't.  But its still a great camera and takes amazing pictures.edit:  I should add that i always use the camera in 'P-mode'.  Do not use on Auto mode, it's complete garbage.  I have no idea why Canon has this on the camera, it was horrible on the S95 and it's horrible on the S100, and it leads to most of the negative reviews on here when people don't know they shouldn't use it.Also, I almost always take pictures (of people) with the flash on.  The only time i don't is when they are facing into bright direct sunlight, or if for whatever reason the flash blows them out.  I would say for 90% of my people-pictures though I use the flash, even in daylight.  It just makes for a better picture, i couldn't explain why but go ahead and try it, you'll be surprised of the results.  If the flash is too bright, sometimes i'll back up a bit, zoom in, and try the same shot again.  B/c you are backed up a couple of feet the flash will be less powerful.I typically won't use a flash when shooting scenes without people in it.""

"20120329","3.0","Image quality great most of the time, video could be better.","Bought this camera a month ago at Best Buy, I hate those long reviews so here are my thoughts:Pros:- Image quality with 1/1.7' sensor are amazing- Low light images astonishing most of the time- Full manual controls, very customizable on P and M modes, Raw- Amazing body texture, feels great and doesn't scratch easely, perfect grip- Small size really pocketable, the smallest compact-enthusast on the market- Full HD video with zoom while recording- 24mm amazing for landscapes and indoorCons:- Video is jumpy beacuse of the 24fps, would be great to have a 30fps or 60fps on next generation. I could not use the camera to make movies while walking, as I usually do on trips, gonna use my Sony TX-100V for videos unfortunately.- Zooming on video is really slow, but understandable.- Aperture at the end of zoom f5.9 is horrible, at low light make images noisy and have a weird color. I would prefer a 4x zoom.- Pop-up flash is annoying, right where my finger stays...- The auto mode sometimes doesn't get the picture right...- Flash cano note be adjusted, causing too bright pictures at night in the auto mode.- Focus is not good in lots of the photos...Update 16/04/12:After a month using, the S100, I can say that the camera is flawed. Serius auto focus issues, auto mode doens't get the picture right in lots of photos. Also, the colours are not vivid... I believe that a firware could fix those problems, it could be the perfect pocket camera.""
"20120328","1.0","Lens retraction error - negative 5 stars!","I was leary of buying this camera because of the consistent reviews of lens error, but had faith in Canon because I've always had great luck with their cameras. Well, it happened to me, too! I actually bought it at Best Buy because they had an online discount that I could use buying in-store that was cheaper than everywhere else. I had the camera for only 26 days when I turned it on (last Friday) to take a picture, turned it off, then quickly turned it back on to take another picture and got the infamous lens retraction error. I was extremely upset. Especially since it was the last weekend my grandparents were in town and my cousin was in town as well. I had NO camera to take photos last weekend. Monday I went back to Best Buy with my receipt and prayers to tell them about what happened. Thank goodness I was able to return it within the 30 day period. I made it by one day!! I did NOT exchange it, but bought another Canon camera for half the price.Do NOT buy this camera!! The lens retraction error is a SERIOUS flaw.  I am extremely disappointed in Canon that they would manufacture a very expensive point and shoot camera like this with this serious flaw. Did they even test out the new camera?? Another note, the battery life sucks! I got maybe 100 pictures with it being on the auto setting before it died.  I barely got 45 photos using the other features/options before the battery died. I even made sure the GPS was off, but did not help sustain battery life.I would give it negative five stars if I could. Scratch this off your list unless you are willing to risk throwing away a $400 camera within a few months....and carrying around an extra battery pack.""
"20120327","5.0","Great midpoint between DSLRs and low-end point-and-shoots","Just bought this camera as a replacement for my last manual-featured point and shoot, a Nikon P7000, which itself was a sucessor to my Canon G10. Both of those cameras were fantastic, and despite being smaller than DSLRs, they were still sufficiently bulky to keep me from bringing them with me all the time, leading to more and more mobile phone photos. This is the first smaller point-and-shoot that actually offers the features and quality to make me walk away from those bulkier counterparts. In just a day of playing around with it, I've found the images to be super crisp and well-balanced, with perhaps a bit of usual Canon saturation. Outside of optical quality and speed, the killer feature for me is the GPS; I'm so sick of having to go into Picasa and manually geotag my photos, and with this camera I won't need to worry about that anymore. Feel-wise, it rests comfortably in the hand, and isn't so light as to feel like a toy.""

Having read early reviews about grainy and blurry pictures, I took a chance.  Many reviewers have had good luck and months had passed to reassure that Canon fixed the issue.  With family visiting, 55 pictures told me I made a mistake.  My camera was clearly one that produced unclear photos, some badly out of focus and many not sharp.  Having owned SLRs, I wanted an easy-to-carry, point and shoot, that worked well on 'auto'.  The S100 had all the features desired - large sensor, wide angle, high resolution - and it was disappointing when it performed poorly.  I do not plan to pick up another one (maybe an S95).  I'm providing feedback for one reason, to alert buyers to be aware; there is still a problem.  Before you punch the button, check the latest and take your chances.  I sincerely hope you get one that works well.""
"20120310","5.0","Fantastic little camera","I love this little camera -- it produces very high quality photos and video, and it has a good array of features. Most of the critical reviews compare it to previous generations (S90 and S95), but having never used an earlier version, I am comparing it to several other pocket-sized cameras I've owned and the S100 blows them all away. My primary camera is a Nikon D80 DSLR, but I've found myself using this one more and more because it's so easy to carry along. I also have an iPhone 4, but since purchasing the S100, I never use the iPhone camera anymore because its photos and video seem so much poorer in comparison to the S100.""

I put the battery in the charger, no light charge and it won't charge. I have no idea if it is the charger or the battery which is crap; the only thing I can say, that this is the first time it happens to me and there is obviously a quality control problem at Canon. A piece of junk expensive and that I have not even used.""
"20120301","5.0","Overall, an improvement","I assume you have read reviews complaining about lack of picture sharpness in some samples of this camera. I suggest reading the in-depth review at dpreview.com, which is a bit more detached and objective than some of the negative reviews here. (This is only natural. Someone who has spent the money to buy a camera, and has been disappointed, will react less objectively than a reviewer who tests four sample cameras, compares their image quality, and doesn't have to spend money on any of them.)Personally I am satisfied with the lens on my sample of the S100, and I speculate that there were production problems in the first models to come off the line. You always run a risk by being an early adopter, especially if the model is brought to market hastily for the Christmas season, as this was.S95 owners will find just enough differences in the controls to be irritated by the S100. After a relearning process, however, I felt that the functional changes were improvements, especially when I want quick access to aperture/shutter speed, ISO, and exposure adjustment. I also appreciate the completely new features such as GPS and automatic dynamic range compression. And most of all I like the wider lens. I am not so thrilled by the rougher finish of the metal body and the finger/thumb grips, presumably included to satisfy users who complained that the S95 was too slippery. I liked the S95's totally clean styling.For those who never touched an S95 (or its predecessors), you have a treat in store: I consider this the most amazingly feature-packed pocket camera, besides being one of the smallest. Almost all the features from my full-size D5 mark II have been replicated here, and are fairly intuitively accessible. Or, of course, you can just set it to Auto. But that isn't why you want this camera, is it? The intended buyer, I think, is a fairly serious photographer who wants total feature-control in a package small enough to take anywhere, with minimal sacrifice of image quality. Yes, the small physical size of the 12MP sensor introduces some additional image noise compared with a full-frame camera, and you may miss the higher pixel count from time to time, but still--an incredible achievement, and very beautifully executed.""

The other reviews that I've seen tend talked about the built in HRD process requiring a tripod--but I don't know why you'd do that anyway.  There are way too many adjustments to make an HDR photograph work to do on a camera.""
"20120225","4.0","Nice compliment to my birding camera","I recently purchased a Canon S100 compact camera to carry with me on birding outings. My usually birding rig is a Canon SLR (50D, 7D...) and a 500mm f/4L IS USM and 1.4x teleconverter. Since this setup is rather large and heavy I have been trying to find a good solution to photograph non-bird subjects such as landscapes/scenery/habitats, people, buildings and whatever else I encounter that a 500mm lens isn't good for capturing.I started off by purchasing an EF-s 10-22mm lens for this but I found that while I really liked the wide angle capabilities of this lens I really wanted more focal length than this lens offered so eventually purchased an EF-s 15-85mm IS lens. This lens was still wide enough to do most of the photography I wanted to do and offered me the extra focal length that I wanted. Both of these lenses are in my opinion excellent. However, after using them for a few years I found that I am still missing tons of photos that I would have liked to have taken because either of these lenses is still more than I want to carry around when I am out birding.After searching the various options I eventually purchased a used Canon S90 compact. I liked the idea that it could be used manually, it had reasonably good image quality, and most of all that it was small enough to fit in my pocket so I could carry it with me everywhere.What I wasn't so thrilled about with the S90 was that operation was a bit sluggish (compared to the SLR I was used to), the lens could only go as wide as a 28mm field of view and that the image quality wasn't quite up to what I really wanted. I know that it isn't reasonable to expect SLR image quality in a small compact camera but I am trying to find a compromise I am happy with and the S90 wasn't quite there.One issue that I wasn't expecting with the S90 was that as I carried the camera around in my pocket the rear LCD screen got quite scratched up and more importantly lots of dust accumulated inside of the camera. The dust eventually started affecting the image quality and I was never able to completely clean it out despite taking the camera apart and cleaning the sensor and as much of the inside of the lens as I could reasonably get to.When the Canon S100 was announced I was excited to see that the focal length range had been expended to 24mm equivalent at the wide end and GPS had been added. Before I purchased the S100 I had been carrying around a GPS logger in my pocket and the GPS feature on the S100 might be able to eliminate one more thing that I had to carry around with me and charge each night.I waited a while to see what the reviews were like and was very disappointed by early reports of decreased image quality (compared to the S90/S95) and issues with the lens. Despite the initial reports my curiosity got the best of me and I ordered the S100. It arrived just in time to take on a birding trip to California, which I just concluded. So the following are my reactions of 10 days of using the S100 in the field and post processing my images.At the start of the trip I turned on the GPS function but kept the GPS logger function turned off. Each time I took the camera out to take a photo it took a long time for the camera to lock onto the GPS signal. Even when standing outside in plain view of a clear blue sky it would sometimes take more than 10 minutes. I read the manual to try to figure out if I was doing something wrong and tried the measures listed there but none seemed to help. It wasn't long before I figured out that to really get any practical use out of the GPS function the logger function must be on. The advantage was that the camera will almost instantly lock onto the signal recording GPS data in the photos but leaving the GPS function on all day long seriously drains the battery. I am still not sure if the GPS function on the S100 will replace my GPS logger or not but I think that it might.A pleasant surprise that I noticed as soon as I started using the new camera is that operation feels substantially faster than it did with the S90. Focus seems more reliable and pretty much all of the functions on the camera feel more responsive. I am very pleased with the overall functionality of the S100.To avoid the dust and LCD damage that I had with the S90 I am carrying the S100 in a thin pouch that seems to be doing a good job protecting the screen and keeping dust away.The auto-focus on the S100 does seem to be a substantial improvement over the S90. With the S90 I would often have trouble getting the focus to lock when doing wide-angle landscape shots. With the S100 this rarely happens but it still does happen from time to time.On the image quality front I am not really sure what to think yet. The weather conditions weren't great for landscape photography for much of my trip but I think the image quality does seem to be pretty close to that of the old S90. In other words not bad but not great either. I think it will be acceptable for my needs (mostly web viewing and small prints no larger than 8x10).There does seem to be a lot of distortion at the widest setting which is a little bothersome. So far I have been shooting JPEG because I haven't been able to get RAW Therapee to work with the S100 RAW files yet. I do know that I was much happier with the S90 when I shot RAW and developed the files in RAW Therapee so I am holding off on final judgment when it comes to image quality.Overall I would say that I am rather happy with the S100 and I think it will be a nice fit for me and others in my situation.Some photos from my first trip with the camera are here:[...]""
"20120221","4.0","Canon s100 Good, and Amazon Bad","Short and sweet for the first part... the camera is amazing, just be prepared to read the manual, otherwise you're not going to understand the majority of the camera and then it's a waste of money. It does chew through batteries, especially if you are using the GPS functionality. Do yourself a favor and buy 2 extra batteries (and make sure that they are not only Canon, but they are Canon batteries made in Japan for the US market. There are a lot of grey market Canon batteries out there in genuine Canon packaging, but when you get them, most of the printing on the battery is in Chinese, not English, and the Chinese batteries hold much less of a charge than the 'real' batteries. I got one of these through a 3rd-party Amazon affiliate and the product description said nothing of this other than it was a genuine Canon battery-- very misleading product description which I've brought to Amazon's attention, but nothing has been done about it so far.The second part is not so sweet. The camera I purchased was sold by Amazon and shipped my Amazon. The first camera came with so little packing in the box that they might as well have put no packaging in the box. Amazon said they would exchange the camera, and I asked that the packaging be correctly done. In fact, I called 3 more time to express the need for correct packaging. When I got the replacement camera, it was packed exactly the same way as the first camera. A call center supervisor said there was nothing he could do about this and I should leave more packaging feedback which was ignored the first time around. I am contacting someone in the corporate office to  escalate this issue from the top down. I can't afford to do my own exhaustive testing on the camera to ensure that it is not damaged (the first camera took 2 weeks before I heard a grinding sound from the lens).I am normally a strong supporter of Amazon who has been buying from them for at least 15 years, but I am very annoyed and frustrated at the way they have (or have not) handled this problem and they refuse to escalate the problem beyond the first level supervisor in the order/customer support center. I have now burned through more than $900 worth of cameras that I am returning to them, and they can't sell these as new, so they have to be eating the cost. In fact, the supervisor refused to send out another camera to me because 'it is likely to have the same packaging issue'. Okay, they won't send any more to me, but if someone else purchases this camera, they will have the same packaging issues as I had.  I can't believe that Amazon considers this to be an acceptable business model! It's also a rare instance where they are not focused on customer satisfaction. I don't care how far up the management chain I'll have to go, but I'm not going to let this drop and I have the names of the people I spoke to that are dropping the ball so badly.""

However, the pictures are sharp and show low grain, at least with an ISO of 1600 or less. I saw complaints about the battery being short lived, but I'm still on the original charge and have used it for 3 weeks. Of course, I haven't taken that many pictures, but at least the battery hasn't run down just sitting in the camera. I have had the camera on quite a bit playing around with different settings and to download the pictures into the computer.It takes a bit of getting used to having to restart the video each clip, as I'm used to putting the camcorder into pause between shots.

The only thing that bothers me so far is the zoom: it's way too sensitive, so it's really hard to set it to the level you want; no matter how softly you touch it, it tends to go too far.Other than that, this is a really great camera, well worth the price.'Four months later, I got the lens error message that, I've just learned, is so common with this camera. I took it back to Best Buy, but they told me I have to ship it to Canon, and it will take about three weeks to get fixed.

"20120201","5.0","Amazing Camera For Outdoor Activities","I have had the s100 for a few weeks now.  Over all it is a great little camera, but it is not a replacement for a DSLR.  I do a lot of stuff in the mountains of Colorado.  I just returned from a back country ski trip into a hut system.  The photos that this camera made were quite good.  It performed quite well at very cold temperatures.  The lens is very sharp.  Over all I gave it 5 stars but actually I almost gave it 4 because because time exposures over one second are limited to iso 100.  This time exposure issue would not be a problem for most people, it's just that I like to take pictures to the night sky from high altitude, but for this my DSLR is better anyway.  Never the less it still does 15 second exposures at iso 100 which would be great for photos of things like city lights at night, etc.Pros:  Excellent picture quality, Best image stabilization I have ever seen, very small, buttons and controls are easy to figure out and not so easy to change by accident, the camera has some interesting special effects and shooting modes but for me, I do all that in Photoshop, I like the automatic lens cover, and the flash is quite powerful for it's size, you can turn the GPS off completely to save battery life, the burst mode is amazing for action shots, it seems quite solid with a case made of metal, it has an easy to grip texture which will help prevent its being dropped.Cons:  Battery life is relatively short (I got 4 extra original Canon batteries used on Amazon for less than $25), the GPS doesn't seem to be accurate all the time, there is the issue of time exposures limited to iso 100, you can't add an external flash but the built in flash is actually quite good.This camera has a nice relatively wide angle lens.  I prefer more wide angle over more zoom.""
"20120130","5.0","Awesome camera for an amateur","I got this camera 4 days ago and have been playing with it since. I'm not an experienced photographer in any aspect, I just bought this camera since it seems to be the best in its class.I did read reviews about it not being up to par in comparison with professional cameras, but I think that is quite unfair since this camera is a point and shoot, not a professional one.The pictures I've taken came out pretty good, I took pictures mostly of my nieces and I got great shots. I also shot some videos and the definition is very high.Update: after 2 weeks of having the camera, I've gotten into the details of it. The ammount of features it has, specially on manual mode, seemed overwhelming to me so I started to read the instruction manual in detail and I've been very happy with the results. I've gotten some great outdoor night shots as well as very good ones using the macro feature.This is the camera I intend to take pictures of my firstborn son/daughter with, so that says a lot about the quality I perceive from it.""
"20120129","5.0","Meets the need","I have two Nikon DSLRs and good glass, so when I need the horsepower I assemble the appropriate combinations.  I never expected this camera to rival what those do.  What I did wanted was a replacement for my carry around camera (a Canon A620) with upgraded capabilities and a smaller housing (camera phones are improving, but nowhere near what I need as far as full manual controls).  I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the images and do notice a different kind of image degrading when I blow up some images than I get with the Nikons, but for the type of shots I will use it for, a non-issue.  Yes, the battery runs down faster than others, so I have two. I like the function ring, am now used to the menu locations and can quickly adjust the flash, exposure and ISO for tricky lighting.  I am glad they finally got caught up with production. I was undecided about this back in October, had one in my hand and put it down.  When I changed my mind and wanted one, I had to wait more than 6 weeks. I need to spend more time with the RAW files; they require a different work flow than my Nikon RAW files, but I don't consider this a draw back.  The video capabilities are adequate, but I'm using a different HD video camera when something scheduled turns up. I'd recommend this to anyone that wants a small quality carry around camera with video (hoping the production quality of your copy is good).""
"20120128","5.0","A whole lot in a very small package","I read the reviews here and else where and it sounds like Canon had a bad run of lenses early on. I haven't seen anything of issue with my camera that was purchased right after the new year. If I do I'll update.Beyond that, what I wanted most was a camera where I could use true manual to control the aperture, exposure time and manually control the focus. Closest I could find before this little beauty was the G series which is in no way a lightweight quick little camera like this. Beyond that the ability to take video was of secondary importance. The ability to use zoom on this one and record in 1080p was really icing on the cake. Finally, the 24mm f/2.0 is fabulous. Oh and with the toggles you can control the f stop easily as well in Manual. The Raw plus jpeg mode is key as well.Frankly for me, the ability to toggle the features and use the front dial to change settings on the fly makes this rig user friendly and highly flexible and adjustable. I was looking for as small as possible with as SLR like ability as possible and I am VERY pleased with this camera.My recommendation.....read the nit picks on the other reviews, if some of the features of the former models are compelling, buy one of them, or buy an S95 for those conditions it does best in. Other than that, make sure you've got a new, new one where they addressed the lens issue, buy a little belt carry case and enjoy the fact that the hardest thing about carrying this camera around is reminding yourself that you've got it with you. In Manual this will do about anything you want in 90-95% of all situations and in P-mode it will do the work for you 75-80% of the time just fine. From my point of view, only reason I'd carry anything else is if I was going to pull out the big gun with the L Lenses. Short of that, this thing is really a dream come true.""
"20120124","3.0","Poor in low light when zoomed","Purchased and returned a CanonS100 to Amazon,because the aperture narrows very quick, and indoor video becomes very dark. My LX5 camera shows great video in low light when zoomed out. After reading the reviews at Amazon I purchased a Canon Elph 300HS. I tested this camera and found the quality of pictures to equal the S100 and the video indoors to be somewhat better. I love the Elph's smaller size and the build quality. The less expensive 300HS has many of the same features as the more expensive S100. Both cameras have 24mm wide angle len's, CMOS sensor, and 5X optical zoom. Manuel controls are not needed as the Elph 300HS shoots great pictures and good video with the press of one button.[[ASIN:B005MTME3U Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (BlackUpdate; Recieved a 2nd S100 from amazon and conducted side by side tests with my 300HS and was surprised that the sharpness, clarity and color of the pictures was very nice with the S100 and only so so with the 300HS. I plan to return the 300HS and keep the Great S100. My previous concern of aperture narrowing in low light rooms was resolved by turning the lights on. I love the S100 camera and highly recommend it. Quality of pictures is my main critera for a small camera and the S100 ptoduces beautiful, photo's and I am very pleased. I love this S100 camera.""
"20120123","4.0","A pretty good enthusiast compact","Let me start off by saying that my copy of this camera (just bought it last week @ Best Buy) does not appear to have any issues with its image quality. I'm not saying that I don't believe that there are some initial quality issues with this this camera. It's just that my camera seems to work fine in that regard.That said... at lower ISOs, I really don't see a monumental difference in RAW or JPEG between it and the S95. At ISO400 and above however...there is noticeably less noise in the S100 pics. I wouldn't go as far as to say that ISO1600 is completely noise free on the S100 but it does deliver a much cleaner picture than the S95 did. Detail capture is about the same between the two cameras. Which is to say, pretty darn good. One thing I have noticed though is that the default colors are a little flatter on the S100 vs. the S95. But this is not necessarily a bad thing. It allows you a little more room to adjust it as you see fit.The camera feels about the same as its predecessors. Very solid build and well constructed. You have a thumb rest on the back of the camera and a tiny indent in the front for gripping. So the camera is very comfortable to shoot with. It also has an extended 5x zoom range.Like it predecssors, one of the hallmarks of the S100 is the rotating ring on the front which you can customize to adjust almost any function you want in the camera. I cannot overemphasize how useful this feature is. My preference is customize to adjust shutter speed but you can also use it adjust ISO and aperture.You have two menus on the camera, the regular menu and then the function menu. The function menu contains the most-accessed shooting settings (ISO adjustment, changing from JPEG to RAW). While the rest of the settings are under the regular menu.Shooting performance is a mixed bag. Shot-to-shot times have improved on the S100 and it is quicker to start up. However, autofocus performance has not improved over the S95. It's acceptable, but, it's disappointing to see that Canon has not improved this aspect of performance over its predecessor.The video is excellent for a compact camera. Generally very clean and excellent audio. It wouldn't take the place of a camcorder. But it's a great choice if you want a camera that shoots quick videos of decent quality.The S100 is very good camera but I don't think in some respects it's a very compelling upgrade from the S95. It's picture quality at lower ISOs is virtually the same and its shooting performance hasn't made big enough of a leap. So if you primarily shoot stills at lower ISOs and don't do a lot of night shooting, you really aren't gaining much by upgrading. But if you shoot a lot in low light, want the extra zoom, and/or are new to the S series from Canon. The S100 should be at the top of your list.""
"20120122","5.0","Love it so far","I am not entirely sure what all of the negative reviews are about but since I have not shot with the S95 I cannot attest to the quality from that perspective. I absolutely love the camera so far and am extremely pleased with my purchase. There are so many manual adjustments that can be made which is huge for me since I sold my DSLR due to its bulky size. This thing looks and feels great, and has the quality to match.""
"20120122","5.0","Does it all in a tiny package","Truly superb, excellent for videos, multi shot mode is incredible ! Don't believe the negative reviews.  Those people are looking for a Leica but can't afford one.""
"20120122","3.0","Frustrating","Some of the reviews I've read make it sound like you can just put this camera in auto mode and take perfect pictures every time.  After using mine for two days I can tell you that it ain't so.  It is capable of taking some lovely pictures, with pleasing flesh tones and perfectly balanced lighting.  But it can take some stinkers too--out of focus, yellow and overexposed (with flash and incandescent lighting).  At times in an indoor setting the screen blurred annoyingly and there was a shutter delay of about 3-4 seconds, by which time the moment had passed.  I love the special effects, like fisheye lens and color accent.  A good camera for some but not all situations, although if you're a very knowledgable photographer and have taken the time to get familiar with all the settings then you'll probably have better results.  Is it worth the money?  Maybe, but not for me.I also have to agree with the complaints about battery life.  After taking about 80 photos, most with flash, and 5 short videos of 5-30 seconds my battery was pretty much depleted.  (Canon says camera should take about 200 photos per charge.)  Video quality is generally ok, but I'll definitely stick with my Sony camcorder when I want HD video.Update:  After playing with a Canon SX230HS I decided to keep the S100.  It has a very solid, comfortable feel--compared to the SX230HS--and I'm getting more comfortable with the various menus and settings.  For example, I can now quickly alter the white balance (which you would expect auto white balance mode to do, but it doesn't) and I've learned to use Program mode or Aperature priority mode in most situations.  I've already mentioned that I love the in-camera special effects, and the slow-mo video too. Finally, compared to cameras I've had in the past there is remarkably little noise at high ISO settings. Still, for the person who just wants a quick-and-easy point and shoot that takes great photos I think the Nikon Coolpix S8200 is a better choice.""
"20120121","5.0","The ultimate prosumer pocket camera","Holy crap is this a good camera.  My trusty Canon G10 went to the big camera graveyard in the sky this past Autumn, having not survived a dip in an Alaskan river.  I loved that camera, and after buying a Lumix LX-5 to replace it (and returning the piece of junk) I decided to wait for this camera, and it turns out to have been worth the wait. It's everything I want in a compact camera.  As much as I loved my G10 for the quality of its images, the sharpness of its lens, and its substantial zoom, I love the S100 even more, perhaps the most because IT ACTUALLY FITS IN YOUR POCKET. I could never quite do that with my G10, and that bugged me.  This little bugger will slip into a pants, shirt, or suit jacket pocket effortlessly.  I'm in heaven.The optics are great, and I can't tell you how much a difference the F2.0 lens makes in taking sharp, gorgeous images in lower light situations.  Admittedly, you lose that 2.0 aperture pretty quick as soon as you hit the zoom button, but I can live with that.  I think the color temperature sensor is not as good as the G10 (I find I have to make more adjustments in Lightroom on the images from the S100 than I did before) but it's pretty darn good most of the time. The macro is great, and coupled with that fast lens, I'm taking some of the best food photos of my life now. While I've only got 5x zoom now instead of 10x, I'm finding that I don't miss it all that much.I am also very, very pleased with the speed of this camera in all respects -- start-up speed, zoom speed, and most importantly image capture speed.  Probably 3x-4x faster than my G10 at least, with a high speed SD card. After messing with the lens cap on the LX-5 for the two weeks I had it, the S100 felt like a miracle with its nicely shielded lens, that opens quickly and quietly.The LCD screen is amazingly bright and crisp (and big!!) and I don't miss not having it articulated.  I wondered whether I'd miss the optical viewfinder, and the answer is a decided: nope.  Seems I can easily live without it.I've got a photography degree, and when I'm taking serious photos I've got 20-30lbs of camera gear to lug around. But when I'm not out shooting seriously, this camera is everything I could possibly want it to be.Highly recommended for anyone who doesn't want to compromise image quality while maintaining the slimmest profile and weight possible.""
"20120112","1.0","Much Worse Lens Quality than S95","Back in Sept 2011 I preordered a silver S100 from Amazon then ordered a black version in Nov in hopes of getting one of either color by Christmas.  Both orders sat unfilled as Christmas approached so I put in a request for a silver S100 with B&H.  After Christmas, B&H notified me that the silver version was in stock so I ordered one.  Two days later Amazon notified me that they were sending my separate orders which I tried to cancel but was too late.  I ended up with three S100's and briefly but carefully tested each one along with my S95 for low light performance (ISO 1600) and outside daylight image quality at ISO 200.  Best quality jpgs were used in all tests.  My particular tests used aperture priority with all lenses wide open at wide angle (24mm eqiv at f2.0 on the S100 and 28mm equiv at f2.0 on the S95) and wide open at extreme telephoto (120mm equiv at f5.9 on the S100 and 105mm equiv at f4.9 on the S95).  ISO 1600 noise was slightly lower on the S100 photos but so was fine detail resolution even in the center of the frame, indicating that stronger low-pass noise filtering was being applied by the S100 compared with the S95.  At high ISO the S100 with 12MP produced less detail than the S95 with 10MP.Another observation for all photos taken at low and high ISO was that S100 image quality deteriorated significantly anywhere close to the frame edges for both the wide-open wide angle and telephoto settings tested.  The S95 produced very slight degradation near the edges but was much sharper near the edges with the lens wide open than any of the three S100's.  These observations did not require pixel peeping at 100% but were very obvious with the photos sized to about 8' x 10'.  Among the three S100's one of the cameras had worse image quality than the other two at both wide angle and telephoto.  Of the two better S100's, one performed better at wide angle and the other performed better at telephoto.  None of the three S100's provided images as sharp across the frame as the S95 with the lens wide open.  Although the lens on the S95 does not zoom quite as wide nor quite as long as that on the S100 it is close (28mm vs 24mm and 105mm vs 120mm).  The reason to 'upgrade' to the S100 was my hope to get at least equal low ISO image quality from the S100 but with slightly wider and longer zoom range and perhaps better low light performance as well.  In my opinion the S100 is not an upgrade at all but uses an inferior lens design to that of the S95 which results in much worse image quality near the edges of the frame.  Further, slightly smoother ISO 1600 images of the S100 resulted from more aggressive reduction in image detail.I was very disappointed in my results and ended up sending all three S100 cameras back for refunds with explanations included.  My one star rating may seem harsh but this camera is being falsely hyped by Canon as an evolutionary improvement or upgrade to the older model S95.  A one star review is more likely to be read by careful buyers.  It may also be read by current happy owners of the S100, some of whom will be upset that their purchase is not being adequately validated.  I wish that I had better things to say.""
"20120106","3.0","Almost, but not quite","I bought this camera for a long cruise.  The two features I wanted in addition to taking pictures, were the GPS and movies.  There is good news and bad news.The good news:1.  The movies are very good, given the problems holding a little camera still while taking a movie.  Picture quality is excellent.2.  The GPS works, but not usually indoors and some times takes a few minutes to sync.  This may be a function of my position and the position of the GPS satellites.  Even after it shows sync, it often does not have the altitude for a few more minutes.3.  Picture quality is very good.The bad news:1.  If you want the GPS to work with the pictures you are taking, you need to leave the camera on.  Unfortunately, when you leave the camera on, one would think there would be a way to have the camera not keep running the rear display.  I've set it for 10 seconds and indeed, it goes off, but it keeps coming back on and I don't push any of the buttons, but do have it hanging by the hand strap.  This means the battery life is terrible.  I had 5 batteries and often would be on the 4th one by the end of the day.2.  It says it will take a 60 minute movie, but not with any known battery and I have not found a power cord for the camera.""
"20120104","2.0","Less than I hoped for...","I intended getting an s100 for my wife as a Christmas present, but could not find it in stock anywhere.  I ended up getting her an s95. We both love the s95.  We took a few hundred pictures over the holidays and are very happy with the results; mostly indoor shots of our children.  I was pleasantly surprised by the responsiveness of the s95.  I read a handful of reviews stating the performance was below average. When I press the button the shutter seems almost instantaneous, even with the flash.Last week I found an s100 at Best Buy.  I assumed it was an s95 with better video and zoom.  My s95 was still within return policy so I purchased the S100.  After taking about 200 shots I knew the S100 was not for me.  While it does have better video and zoom, these do not offset all the disadvantages compared to the s95. First the LCD screen is very dull.  The s95's LCD is bright and vibrant, and very visible in low-light.  I can barely see the LCD on the s100 in low-light.  Also, if you zoom on the s100 and move it to track a subject the LCD becomes a blurry mess.  The LCD on the S95 stays relatively clear when tracking a subject.The deal breaker for me was indoor shots with moderate light.  I suspect (going by reviews) the s100 does better at ISO 1600 and above, but I almost never go above 400.  I found the pictures on the s95 to be sharper and have better color under the same conditions.  The difference was not significant, but the s100 should at least been on par since it cost over $120 than the s95.  The s95 also fired faster when using the flash.  I found the s95 more responsive under all conditions (except burst mode).I do like the design of the S100, but the build quality seems below the s95.  The s95 feels very solid while the s100 more hollow.  The added rubber on the front and back is a welcome addition to the s100.  It definitely helps your grip when shooting with one hand.Overall I am just disappointed.  I was so excited about getting the S100.  I thought it was going to be exactly what I wanted after using the s95.  If the s100 was about $250 I think it would be a decent value, but $429 is ludicrous.  If you are looking for a compact camera with close to professional quality get the s95 while you still can.  Maybe I just got a bad one, but I am not exchanging it for another. It's going back to Best Buy.  I still have the s95 and plan for it to stay with me and my wife for many years to come.""
