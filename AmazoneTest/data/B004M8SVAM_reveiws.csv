I spent $82.00 on the camera.  I surly would not spend another $105 to repair it.  It is clear to me that Nikon has no intention of supporting this product.  It is clear to me that with all the complaints I have seen here and other places that this is a design flaw in their camera.  Needles to say I am looking for a new camera.  Also needles to say Nikon will not be on the list for a replacement as their warranty is not worth the paper it is written on.  Shame on you Nikon, and Buyer Beware.""

"20120520","1.0","A Lemon Camera with no Corporate Backing","After my experience with this model, I cannot in good faith recommend this camera or any Nikon product to anybody. I purchased the Coolpix L24 digital camera (red) for approximately $100 at a Wal-Mart in Greenville, SC in October 2011. It looked sharp and had a lot of nice features and I thought it to be a wise and economical purchase. However, when I actually started using it, I noticed that it had some problems that I was willing to overlook. (unfortunately none were within the 15-day return limit at Wal-Mart) The delay on the actual picture (time between snapping and capturing image was a little long in my opinion) and the zoom feature had issues - worked about 3/4 time. However, the final straw for me was on a trip to Tennessee in April 2012. While trying to capture family pictures of my wife's relatives (most of whom I hadn't ever met), the camera inexplicably stopped working. The lcd screen turned black and left an incoherent image on the screen. Since the camera was only 7 months old and had a 12-month warranty, I hoped that Nikon would make it right and either repair it free or refund my money. (I was hoping for the latter). Unfortunately, neither happened. After sending the camera in to Nikon, I received a letter back saying it was not covered under warranty and would be $105 to fix. After sounding off to the service number (800) 645-6678 about the poor quality of the camera (I was not happy that the invoice was trying to blame me saying it was caused by impact damage), he gave me another number to call (631) 547-4200, which led me to (800) 645-6687. After wasting 20 minutes talking to outsourced customer service - a conversation where the representative repeatedly tried to tell me to send my camera in to be fixed (if they listen to the recording - I think I made it abundantly clear 3 or 4 times that is exactly what I did). I'm not sure it ever registered to him that i found it absurd for them to expect me to pay $105 to repair a lemon camera. I also told him and the other representative not to ship it back to me. The second rep actually said it was free and couldn't understand why I didn't want it shipped back. Do people actually think stuff is free? I was looking out for their bottom line (i'm a CPA). In the end, the 2nd representative said he would email my complaint to management on Monday. The bottom line here is that if you are willing to settle for a camera that will only last 7 months and break, have issues from the getgo, not be honored under the warranty, and have to call about several different numbers to complain without really gettting service, then this is the camera for you.""

We contacted Nikon and sent it back for repair under warranty.  when we got it back a month or so later the screen was on but was out of focus and you couldn't clearly see the subject. It seemed to take pictures OK but we couldn't even view the pictures we had taken because the screen was too blurry.  My wife was scheduled to go out of town to visit kids/grand kids in a few weeks and wanted to take the camera with her.  We contacted Nikon again and was told that it would be fine to return the camera after she got even though the original warranty was expired they would take care of the repair because the hadn't fixed right the first time.  When she returned we sent it back again and after another month or so we got a call from Nikon and was told that it was no longer under warranty.  I went great detail to voice my complaint and was told by the rep she would need to discuss it with the supervisor and would get back to me.  Another month want by. Nikon called and said the repair was about $100. and the best they would do is fix it for half price. Needless to say I told them to shove it! They sent me the broken camera back.  At this point I don't care if Nikon makes the best camera in the world, their service sucks.  I will never purchase another Nikon product.

Took a few photos on dry land and quickly filled the internal memory.  Bought an 8 GB SD card and then shot a few pictures while diving.  Nice little camera.  After getting home I left the camera on my desk for a few days.  Today I decided to put it safely back in its box, but the battery door kept flying open!  I naturally assumed that I hadn't latched the door properly.  But after fooling around with it for a while I can see that a tiny, almost microscopic, plastic tab that is part of the door latch is broken.  I was immediately disgusted that relatively heavy batteries being pushed by fairly substantial springs are exerting their combined forces against such a tiny little plastic tab!Talk about a weak link!  This puny little millimeter sized tab is supposed to handle the weight of the batteries and the force of the springs?  Not to mention the SD card, which also seems to be spring loaded.Even more surprising:  the number of customer complaints about this problem and Nikon's extremely poor customer-unfriendly response.Nikon, why do you keep doing this?  You want everyone to know that you sell top-professional gear, yet you sully your name with cheap crap like this.  I probably would be less upset if this happened two years after purchase, but this occurred, basically, after only minutes of use.I guess I'm going to have to resort to tape, which I'm hoping will work for me (some say it won't).""

I spent another hour re-reading the manual and troubleshooting to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong.  Satisfied the camera was defective, I returned it and was told by the camera department (which carries all of the major brands) that this model is the one most frequently returned, both because of the flash problem and because many persons find it sets up and focuses too slowly on automatic and is too complicated.  He recommended the comparable Canon, for the excellent macro close-ups and low-light photos without flash, two features we use a lot.

Honestly, I've gotten better pictures from disposable cameras! The few pictures I took outside were okay, but I spent the majority of the week indoors at a chorus convention. I tried every setting on the camera, and STILL couldn't get a decent shot. If the lighting was low, the picture was ridiculously blurry and noisy even with a flash. And if the lighting was good, the flash was so bright, everyone/thing in the picture was way overexposed. If I turned off the flash, the picture was blurry. I just couldn't win! The lag time between pushing the button and the picture actually snapping was worse on this camera than any I've ever used. If I could give it less than 1 star, I certainly would.

(tried different shooting settings, different SD cards, different battery types, flash on/off). Ads and manual say 2-3 seconds, unless I have a defective model this is NOT the case.Slow high-speed mode. Sports mode is about 1 second between shots and too slow to be practical.Slow standard photos (set for 3MP) mode still take a good couple of seconds between shots in good lighting.3.6x optical zoom (in an era of 14x)640x480 movies (most others are HD 1080/720.)Overall:========A good compact basic starting digital camera with a few features you normally don't see in a budget model.If you want HD, faster shooting, zoom, etc...you'll have to pay a bit more and look elsewhere.I've seen other cameras with a few more features, higher zooms (Olympus 7030 has 7x) in the same price point...but none of them use AA's.If you don't need image stabilization the previous models are almost identical (L22, L20, etc...) and can be had for half the price at the time of this review.""

My biggest complaint is its inability to take photos when it counts. If the camera is set to 'Easy Auto', the camera apparently has a hard time focusing and deciding what mode to switch to. When it does this, it takes so long; I very often miss a good shot. I also get very frustrated with it sometimes. My friends are very familiar with the phrase, 'I hate this  camera!' I wish I had a different one.I gave it three stars because, even though I get very frustrated with it a lot of times, it does take good photos. When it works it works very well. If you need it to take photos quickly I would consider a different camera. Its auto focus is not very smart. If the scene is not in focus, it won't let you take the photo.""

One thing that bothers me is that when you zoom to the farthest amount its difficult to hold the camera still so it doesnt come out sort of blurry.I use Linux mostly and I really like the fact that I don't have to mess around with any software if I don't want.  Just plug and play drag and drop.  simple.  Lastly the battery life is not great not terrible on this camera.  I put new batteries in it then went to the fair and took several 20 second videos and several pictures in a span of 2-3 hours and then it died.But overall its a nice camera besides the battery life and the zoom.""

We debated and read the reviews of this versus the canons, but my friend who is a photographer was always enamored with Nikon products since in high school and she depends on them 25 years later for her mortgage and food.

We took pictures of EVERYTHING on our trip.  We took multiple shots we snapped it all and then edited it all deleting the spoiled shots and keeping the amazing ones that make our vacation look amazing.  Our memories are frozen for us and we can clearly recall everything in the shots with clarity.  The faces were auto focused.  There were settings for all the environments we encountered.

"20110731","1.0","coolpix not so cool","I bought this camera for a summer vacation.  (My daughter had a Coolpix and had trouble with the camera's battery door not closing.  I thought it was just a fluke.) The very first day I used my camera on vacation, the battery door would not close.  Upon looking at it closely, it seemed a small piece of plastic was broken.  I had to tape the door shut for the remainder of my trip.  When I returned, I sent the camera back and bought a different brand.  It is a great small camera and ease of use is wonderful - price is right as well!  However, I read other reviews that stated a similar problem with the battery door.  Once this breaks, the only fix is to buy a new camera.""
"20110725","1.0","Garbage!","Bought this camera for my daughter. One month later, the battery compartment door retention pins break, rendering the unit useless and there was no way to close the door-not even with tape. I learned of this in July as she was away at school, but it is 'guaranteed' for 1 year! Yay!  I followed Nikon's directions to return to them. They advised me that they did not consider this covered as it was possible we may have dropped it or forced the door closed. I calmly explained that wasn't the case AND that we had a friend with the same camera and same problem!  ALSO, you can read the reviews of this camera on various sites (or the L-22) to see that it's a common gripe.  They would not fix it and wanted $93. After the postage/insurance to ship it to them, I could buy a new camera. But I  will not ever buy another Nikon product. I am sticking with Canon as they have covered their product for me in the past OUT of warranty!!! You've been warned.""

I had an older Coolpix model from 2008 but this camera is so much nicer... 14 megapixels, and it runs on AA batteries. Overall, Im in love with this camera. Not to mention the red one (the one that i bought) is $20-30 less than if you were to buy in store. Also, just a tip, if you do buy this camera be sure to buy a memory card, the actual camera has hardly any memory at all. Im fortunate to have kept mine from my last camera. Anyhow, I reccomend this camera. Nikon is (in my opinion) the best camera company out there, I have used their cameras for personal/recreational and business use.

But the fact is that I did not make any significant changes in the factory settings... Moreover, I don't think that one should be required to be a photography expert to use this kind of camera... In summary, I was on vacation and just bought the camera and used it for day to day photos. And the results were terrible!""

Well after $11.00 to return to Nikon, I quickly received an email saying they would need about $100 to repair and return.  The latch was not covered under their warranty.

"20110627","2.0","I curse this camera every time I use it","Grant it I am not the most electronically savey person, but I curse this camera.  I got it as a gift, my last camera was a Kodak Easy Share, one of the older models, and I LOVED it.  But it was too big to carry around with me all the time so I asked for a little camera for my birthday and got the Nikon 'cool'pix.  The only thing cool about this camera is it's size.  After the first 2 months of owning it the battery cover broke. And it was never dropped or man-handled. So I had to have a big ugly piece of tape on my brand new camera. I realized very quickly that this thing devoured energy.  I would put a new set of top of the line batteries in and after using it maybe a total of 2-3 hours, it was dead.  For this reason I switched to using rechargable batteries and it sucked the life out of them even quicker.  There is nothing more frustrating than thinking you have plenty of battery power and going to use your camera at a crucial moment and it dies on you.  And good luck catching those spontanious special moments that you leave your camera on and waiting for, like at a wedding or suprise birthday party or your childs first steps, because by the time it decides it's ready to snap the shot, the moment has long passed you by. To make a long story short, I wouldn't even GIVE this camera away after I buy a new one.  Just spend the extra 50-100 bucks and get something that won't make you curse like a sailor.""

Just make sure you carry plenty of spare AAs or you'll certainly be sorry!The only other drawback is the zoom, it's very limited. But this is still a basic simple camera, so you shouldn't really have high expectations on the zoom capability.It's a point and shoot type of camera, great for pics with friends, family, etc. Nothing over the top special.""
"20110620","2.0","Very Disappointed","I am not a professional but I am an avid picture taker and I am pretty knowledgeable about digitalm cameras.  I did alot of research and chose this camera because it was simple without alot of frills and buttons AND best of all, it works on AA batteries.  I was hunting for a new camera for my 75 year old mother who would actually prefer to have her old 35 mm camera back.  My mom needs a simple point and shoot that will take consistent pictures and takes batteries she won't have to worry about charging or keeping track of a charging cord.  She is going on a vacation and on her last trip, she kept forgetting to charge her camera batteries.  I thought this camera fit all of my requirements but the picture taking is inconsistent.I tried the camera out first and kept the camera primarily in Easy Auto Mode so that I would not have to fool with changing the scene modes but the flash was inconsistent.  The flash only worked about a third of the time so the indoor pictures were not always good.  I read the manual but can't figure out why the flash was inconsistent.  The outdoor pictures were good but on the longest zoom, the pictures were blurry.When the flash worked (indoors) and the longest zoom wasn't used (outdoors)the pictures were awesome and made me think great camera! But like I said, this was not consistent- even when I took pictures of the same thing back to back.  Also, I put a high speed memory card in the camera but the camera still took anywhere from 3 to 7 seconds to recover from a picture and it was frustrating waiting to take the next picture.  And, in auto mode, the camera would sometimes take longer to adjust itself.  But I will say that when the camera did take a longer time to adjust, the pictures came out very nice.  And, when I changed the scene modes and exposures and megapixels, I was able to change the quality of the pictures.All in all, I had high hopes for this camera based on the great reviews and the features this camera but I was disappointed when the camera did not perform as hoped.  My mom is not at all technological and she would get frustrated with trying to figure this camera out.  She is not going to adjust scenes and modes and just needs a simple point and shoot that preferrably uses regular batteries.This is not the camera I hoped.""

It takes ok pics in the most ideal situations (ie perfect lighting ), the flash is beyond disappointing, and no matter how I tried to adjust it, I could not get my desired affect.  The zoom on the camera was not bad, and it was easy to use.  I did find a lot of lag in some settings, and the biggest issue was that it was very hard to hold the camera still, and if you don't the pictures are a complete blur.  Overall I was very unhappy with the performance of this camera.  I ended up deleting half the photos I took because the quality was so bad.

The only problem i have with the camera is that it has a hard time focusing on small texts. For example i want to copy a receipt and send it to the manufacturer it would come out blurry.Overall this is a great camera and i would highly recommend this for travel or for quick takes""

"20110407","1.0","Edited Review - Battery Door Problem","It is with regret that I must edit my review on the Nikon L24.Because of a weak design on the battery cover door I cannot recommend this camera.  However, I am leaving the original review below this addition because everything I originally wrote about the operation still stands.  The 1-star rating I'm now leaving reflects the inadequate closure design and Nikon's refusal to replace the battery cover under warranty.The battery door cover on mine broke just like the others who have written about the L20 / L24 series Nikon cameras.  My defect made itself known to me after 6 months of use.  There was never any abuse, no drops, no bumps, camera was kept in a case except when I was taking or transferring pictures.The lip on the inside of the battery door gave way as I was taking a picture - the door popped open and the batteries dropped at my feet.  It took me a minute or two with reading glasses to see exactly what happened and where the breakage/weakness was.For those interested, I have close-up pictures of the broken area and they can be seen on this page:[..link removed..]When I contacted Nikon about this, I was instructed to send in the camera for evaluation.  I did (it was worth a $6 gamble).  After they got the camera, I was told that the repair would cost approximately $50.  I replied back stating that I felt that it was a design flaw and that the repair should be covered under warranty.  In a subsequent reply, I was told that the issue is not repairable under warranty but the repair itself would be warrantied for 6 months in case another similar failure occurred.I chose to NOT pay $50 to repair a $100 camera and will attempt a repair myself later.  In the meantime, I'll tape the door closed with electrical tape.Again...*** I cannot recommend the purchase of this camera due to the weak design of the battery door ***.  The cover is under constant pressure from the battery springs and the design of the plastic lip is inadequate to take this pressure.My advice to existing owners whose cameras have not broken YET is to take the pressure off of the poorly designed door that is subject to breaking by stretching a piece of good-quality electrical tape to secure the door.Other than the flimsy battery door design, this IS a good camera.  Nikon really should be covering this repair under warranty and I'll be sure the check for similar design flaws if I ever consider another Nikon camera purchase.--------------------------------------------Original review below--------------------------------------------Disclaimer:  This particular review isn't being written from an avid photographer's point of view.I needed a small, inexpensive, good-quality, easy-to-use camera for my job.  My main use for this camera is taking good, clear indoor before/after photos of various electronic devices and related components.  My requirements are a large LCD viewer, the ability to use common AA batteries, have my settings (date/time, photo mode) retained after batteries were removed and replaced, and a quick way to transfer images to my PC's that doesn't rely solely on a USB cable.Preferring not to have to deal with camera angle or cumbersome tricks to reduce flash reflection from shiny surfaces, I was hoping to find something that would allow effective non-flash settings where a semi steadily-held camera could take clear, acceptable indoor pictures as required by the companies that I do work for.As much as I tried, I could not get good, consistent results with the e510 but I seem to have found that camera with the L24.So far with the L24, I've taken pictures of HDTV televisions (displays powered both on and off), PCB boards, product labels, macro shots of venting capacitors, etc. - *all without flash*, using only ambient room lighting.For me, time is an important factor and with these onsite job shots, I do not have the time or desire to do pre-shot adjustments or after-processing like resizing, gamma-tweaking, or cropping.  The shots I take need to be ready to be attached to an email or be uploaded to technician portals.  The settings that I have found that work for me is the  'white balance' and 'motion detect' set for auto, resolution set for 1024x768 (for email-ready small file and dimension), and flash set for 'off'.As long as my subjects aren't in the shadows, the camera is held relatively steady, and the images framed properly, my pictures are clear and all I have to do once I return home is transfer to my PC, attach and send.  The settings as described above allow clear pictures for my uses in both regular and macro modes.The camera remembers my settings with its AA batteries out and its 3' LCD viewer lets me verify a good shot (they've all been pretty good so far).Connectivity:All of my PC's have a card slot that accommodates the SD type, so if the included UC-E6 cable isn't handy, I remove the SD card from the camera and transfer images that way.  If I needed more of these cables, I can get them for $4 each on eBay.You don't have to use a SD card (camera has 17MB built-in) but I do recommend using a card for the extra storage and image-transfer/connectivity options.When buying a SD card, consider the card-reading compatibility with your existing equipment if you intend on using using the card to transfer images.  Some card readers do not read SDHC (high-capacity) cards, I was aware of this potential compatibility issue beforehand and bought a standard SD 2GB (not a SDHC) card.I'm sure once more people buy this camera, more features than I covered will be discussed.  There are settings on the L24 that I will probably never use.  In my quick tour through the menu settings (haven't read the manual yet - haha) I didn't see where you can manually adjust aperture or shutter speed independently but there is an exposure control.  The lack of manual settings might be a minus for serious photographers but like I said before, photography isn't a hobby for me - I just want to take good pictures easily and quickly.""

I took pictures of the fireworks on the 4th of July and they turned out good. I have trouble getting action pictures unless it is on the continuous picture mode. I am not sure if any other camera for the price is going to be any better. I think maybe I should have paid more and gotten a better camera. This is our 2nd cool pics camera.

"20120402","1.0","Nikon L24","This is my sixth Nikon camera purchase and I must say I am very disappointed.  While the camerea works properly the real problem is in the packaging.  Upon arrival I opened the box, assembled the strp, batteries and found out at this time there was no memory card.  A memory card cost to the manufacturer is probably in the pennies range, yet they chose not to include one, basicly making an exciting purchase a big disappointment.  Since a digital camera without a memory card is simply a hunk of metal and plastic, this camera is worthless out of the box.  You must purchase a memory card separately.I simply believe this is poor marketing.  Yes, I suppose if you read what is part of the package and make assumptions of what is not, you will see thee is no memory card included.  I could also make the assumption that there is no underwatercase included, no 2 year photography training included, no dinner for two or a host of other accessories, no memory card is not one I would make.  Buy another camera, any other camera.""
"20120401","2.0","ONLY good outdoors with natural light","I was very disappointed in this camera.  Cheap, yes, but a Nikon should still take good pictures.  If you are outside or even inside with PLENTY of natural light, it's fine.  But if you are in an even remotely low light situation, the pictures are extremely blurry.  As far as I can tell this is because the flash doesn't flash in all low light situations AND there is no 'switch' to force the flash.  You can toggle between auto flash and no flash.  If you only want a cheapo camera to take to the beach or hiking, then it's fine.  But if you want to try to take good pictures indoors of your kiddos, it's trash.  Save your money and buy something better.  I ended up giving up and going back to my 7 year old minolta.""
"20120327","1.0","DON'T BUY","I have had a Nikon Coolpix camera for a little under a year, and it has been nothing but problems. From the beginning, the touch screen has been most difficult, flipping through pictures in the opposite direction then my finger says, or just not working at all. I've missed many good shots because of its incompetence.I must say, the video quality is great on this little thing. Although I mainly wanted it for still shots, and those come out blurry most of the time.Now, about Ten months after I bought the camera, it has stopped charging when I plug it in. The output slot has stopped working, so I cannot hook it to my computer at all.

It turned out to be a very good choice. She has now used it for about 6 months and it never disappointed her. She particularly likes the idea that it is powered by readily obtainable AA batteries. No need to worry about lugging a battery charger along every time she ventures out with the camera. This is a great feature for her, in addition to the astounding quality of the pictures it takes. It is more than a camera. It is a NIKON! And at a reasonable price too!""

First of all it was beautiful, the color was cranberry red one of my favorite colors.  After using it a few times I loved it even more because it was easy to use and took great pictures.  However, after about 3 uses, the battery compartment door would pop open every time I used it and the batteries would fall out on the floor.  It was so embarrassing!!  I would line people up to take pictures and every time I aimed the camera to shoot the picture, the batteries fell out!!!!  This is clearly a design flaw.  Many people have complained about this problem and Nikon refuses to own up to their mistake.  Don't waste your money on this camera unless you want to be embarrassed like I've been so many times.""

It still closes...for the moment...but one corner doesn't latch, so it won't be long.  If you do get one (it's otherwise a nice camera, especially for the price), be careful when closing the door that it is slid all the way out, then press down fully so the door is completely flush with the case, *then* slide it in to close.  If you've done it right, there will be a very audible click that is distinctly louder than when you do it wrong. When opening, it much easier: slide the white latch button towards the back of the camera, then while holding it there, slide the door to the side and it will spring open as you release pressure on it.""

It has a lot of settings to choose from, however when you have it on the right setting, the picture is always blurry. The close-up setting is the worst. You can stand so still, but it doesn't make any difference. I have missed so many great photo moments because the picture never turns out right. It usually takes about 5 tries until I give up.

Interesting that the last two cameras I've owned are still functioning...I decided to upgrade and passed the old cameras onto my teenaged brother and my nine-year-old godson.(If a 5-year-old camera can survive a 9-year-old for three months, why can't this one survive three months of gentle use by an adult??)

The battery compartment spring is WAY too strong, thus breaking the latch, so now it doesn't stay closed at all. The only way to use it is to tape it shut. However, since it drains battery power like nobody's business, you're constantly peeling the tape, replacing batteries, then hunting around for the damned tape again to re-tape it. Also, the delay between pressing the button and the camera actually taking the picture is WAY too long for cameras of this day and age. I've missed out on too many good shots to count.

Biggest problem is the construction of the batteries and the disk being in the same compartment.  Batteries do no have to be changed too often but I like to take the disk out and see the pictures on my computer or television.  The pressure on the plastic door from the batteries caused the door to break.  I sent my camera back to the company and received a letter stating that it would cost me $29.00 to repair plus $12.50 to ship it back to me plus $2.03 tax for a grand total of $43.53.

Unfortunately, our unit consumes the entire power in the two 'AA' batteries quickly.  After 50 pictures are taken and reviewed new batteries must be installed.Also, it doesn't seem to take good pictures.  There are a lot of modes the camera could be put into depending on the scene, and the camera does need to be put into a specific mode to take a picture.  The 'auto' mode doesn't seem to work as well as a similar digital camera I bought years ago.If you need a camera that takes a quick shot, this camera isn't it.  By the time I've replaced the batteries and put the camera into a specific mode, my shot is usually long gone.I can't recommend this camera as it is only 'adequate'.

Either too bright or dark when taken in auto mode.  The flash focus never worked consistently no matter what setting.  Seemed to have a mind of its own.  When taking a picture where there was sufficient light, the flash would go off creating a distorted picture with the unnecessary light.  Other times when I wanted the flash, it would not work.  The time it took to process pictures to the memory was excessive.  Finally, the camera would shut down with a battery exhausted message after just a few pictures were taken with new batteries.""

"20120104","1.0","Battery Door Latch Problem - Me Too","I rarely leave a negative review for a product but I am particularly disappointed with the rediculous construction of my Nikon CoolPix [in my case L22] battery door latch as I bought my Nikon for the historic reputation for quality of cameras bearing that name. Unfortunately I did not take endurance into account.After 10 months of use, as others have been reviewing, the door to the battery compartment on my Nikon Coolpix also unexpectedly fell open and as with other reviews I found myself on my hands and knees looking for the batteries. This began to happen with increasing frequency, until, as with others, I finally had to tape the door shut.My decision to turn to taping the door occurred on the night I was on the roof of a hotel, in pitch dark, attempting to take photos and video of 2012 News Years Eve fireworks in San Francisco. You have my permission to laugh here: In scrambling around in the dark, grabbing for anything the shape of a AA battery I nearly fell down a fire escape opening in the roof!My New Year's resolution is to check to assure that the reviews I read were written more than 48 hours after the product was received!

"20120101","2.0","Picture Quality is not great","I received this camera for Xmas and was very excited. Once I started taking photos I began to get really disappointed in the quality. If someone was not sitting perfectly still the picture would come out blurry. I was using the easy auto mode at this point. Considering my children (all in grade school) put their money together to buy this I kept taking pictures of everything everywhere on every setting trying to figure out what was the best setting for where. But if something important came up I would go back to my 7 year old 6.1 mega pixel Kodak easy share.The problem was it took too long to focus and if the subject moved it would not turn out right, similar to some cell phone cameras. Other pictures included flash when not needed an no flash when it was needed. It does have multiple scenes to play around with, but the average person will want to pull out their camera and press a button when their child is sliding down a slide or walking for the first time. Rather than turning it on, And choosing menu options thus possibly missing the shot.Upon researching the camera and finding out about the probable battery door problem, I decided to return it.""

"20111229","4.0","Good First Camera","Wanted a decent first camera at a low enough price point for my 11 year old daughter to start out with. We weren't disappointed and she has really enjoyed it. She has been able to take some good pictures using the automatic settings, yet the camera has enough extra features for her to learn more as time goes on.""
"20111228","3.0","ok","This camera, is a good start for beginners in photography. It is easy to navigate the different settings. But can be slow between a taken picture and taking another picture. When doing very close up objects less than half a foot away it can take a long time to focus in on you subject. Over all it is an amateur's camera.""

I was about to take a picture of my kids, 5yo and 3yo, the camera turned off and I felt the batteries on my feet. Since then, it can not keep batteries in the compartment!!! Do I have to walk and take pictures around with Nikon  camera with taped battery compartment? If you want to waste your money, go ahead and buy it, but I recommend: DO NOT buy this camera! Very surprised and disappointed with Nikon!!!""

I believe it will be a great camera, however I was disappointed that it did not come with a battery and charger.  We bought another brand for less and it came with one.  Other than that, I suspect it will serve its purpose well for our 10 year old son.""
"20111227","1.0","A Piece of Junk","Whatever you do, do not buy anything that says, 'Nikon Coolpix'.  I purchased one for almost $300.00.  Within one year it started shutting off.  I had to fight Nikon to get it to work.  They finally gave me a newer and supposedly better one.  This Christmas while taking family pictures, the newer and better one suddenly went blank, the zoom lens got stuck in out-mode and hasn't worked since.  This is a piece of junk.  I am about to investigate buying a nice Canon.""
"20111226","1.0","Slow to Shoot & Chancy to Focus","I bought this camera to replace an old CyberShot. I use it almost every day and take an average of 30 to 50 images at least. I use it in a multitude of environments. With that being said I am extremely disappointed in this camera. I have had the focus 'fail' in a landscape/distance environment every time I have used it. The shutter is slow to react. Sometimes it makes a shutter type noise and some times it does not. I do not care how many megapixels a camera has if the quality of the resulting image is questionable and cannot be depended upon. I am going to replace it as soon as I can rationalize the $90.00 expenditure as a loss.""

I worked as a photographer for many years during the 'film' era and cannot believe the picture quality I get from this little camera. It fits in my pocket or purse, weighs practically nothing and takes videos too! Can't beat it for the price.""

It finally died last week with a bright white light! yes it went into the light, the entire screen went white and could no longer take pics. I knew it was gonna die from the white lines that kept appearing across the screen till it finally went all together. Please save your money, it's cute to look at but is an utter waste, highly disappointed! Nikon please take this camera off the market and reassess the quality of your product!!!!!!!!!!""
"20111219","2.0","one of the slowest auto focus cameras I have ever used","This isn't a camera I would have been interested in, but my wife got it as a gift and I thought it would be great for her.  She had been using a few year old hand down camera I gave her and I thought that any modern camera would be a step up from that one.  I was wrong.I could give a more comprehensive review of the issues with this camera, but it's a sub $100 camera so I will just point out the most significant flaw of this camera from my perspective.  A flaw that many other cameras in this class do not have.After my wife took 50 or so pics she asked me to get them off the camera and onto her computer.  Typically what I do is put them on my computer first, cull the obviously terrible pics and then do some light editing of the rest (crop, rotate, straighten, color correct).  I ended up deleting about half of them because they were so out of focus the subject was unrecognizable.With her previous camera there was the occasional really out of focus pic, but with the L24 around half were.  Curious as to why this would be I grabbed her camera and started playing with it.  That's when I saw the fatal flaw with this camera.  It's auto focus is unacceptably slow under most conditions.  By unacceptably slow I mean 1-2 seconds under conditions her 3 year old camera would focus on near instantaneously.  What happens is she presses the shutter button half way and then all the way thinking the pic will be in focus. It often isn't because the camera has not finished focusing.I had to show her that the camera's reticule turns green and the camera beeps and until that happens she should not press the button fully.  We were both amazed how long it took the camera to finish focusing.""
"20111218","3.0","having some troubles","Bought this for my wife, to replace an ailing Sony digital...could possibly be not yet used to this camera, but it seems to be somewhat 'off' in the exposures; she hasn't yet gotten a good set of pictures (nor consistant exposures) no matter what settings she uses on the camera. Using the flash seems to be inconsistant as well...Haven't tried Nikon support, so they may have some answers. The manual for the camera is on a DVD, which makes it difficult to reference 'in the field' which is when you need it most, especially with a new camera, and it doesn't seem to explain the various settings very well... Have to rate it a 3 until we get some answers....""

"20111214","1.0","PIECE OF CRAP!","Do yourself a favor and spend a couple of extra bucks to buy yourself a Kodak or Canon if you would like a camera that lasts more than a year.  After just a couple of months of owning my Nikon Coolpix camera, I got a lens error in which the lens would pop out, then pop right back in.  I sent it in for repair and Nikon fixed it for no charge, but then a couple of months later, I had the same problem.  Only now they were charging me since the one yr warranty was over...and the charge is more than the price of the camera itself!  So my only word of advice, if you want a camera that won't break on you in a few months, treat yourself to a more reliable camera.OH, and don't expect any sympathy from Nikon...all I basically got was a 'warranty's up, too bad'.""
