I was beyond satisfied and content with my purchase. It is definitely a must buy if looking for a great camera bag for an amazing price.

When I first got it, I tried changing the dividers so that I could keep my main lens on the camera while in the bag, but I ended up just storing the body because I couldn't find a configuration that worked. I've also got the manual, a macro extension tube, cords, adapter, a card reader, and a table-top tripod in the bag. Lots of room for accessories. Only gripe is the plastic connectors for the shoulder strap squeak when I'm walking. Could probably fix it with some graphite dust or something.""

"20120427","4.0","Pretty cheap insurance for your SLR","When I bought this it was mainly for the price and the description compared with other bags available, but after buying it I discovered that it was not quite what I had expected. The dividers that are shown in the pictures on the listings are not as heavy duty as they look and they are not permanently attached to the bag, they attach with velcro strips. I was a little hesitant about putting a $900 camera in it until I started placing things in the bag and arranging the dividers. At that point I realized that this had been a good purchase after all. You can set it up to keep each lens separate from the others as well as keeping the camera body in it's own space, and you have extra pockets and space to carry a wide variety of accessories for your camera separate from everything else. It really is a very cheap way to ensure the safe transportation of expensive DSLR cameras,lenses, and accessories in a way that protects them from each other and from outside damage.""

I'm sure I will be able to rig something up, or play with the arrangement inside. All that aside, this bag is made with amazing quality and is compact. If you are looking for a compact bag, I suggest this one. If you are looking for a bigger bag, I would move one up to one of the more pricy ones by canon.""

"20110818","4.0","Great bag, a little hard to get into easily","This bag has proven to be very durable for me; the construction is solid. What I don't like about it is probably a feature, not a bug -- the closing strap prongs snap REALLY WELL in to the receiver. This means that if you're trying to fish your camera out of the case for a shot, you better be filming something standing still, because you can't just flip the bag open with ease unless it's already open.There is enough storage capacity for one camera and 2-3 medium-sized lenses, with several filters able to be included in the various pouches. If you're using a larger lens, it may not fit in this bag with the camera at all, though if you play with the variable, adjustible velcro side panels inside the main compartment, you can get a surprising number of useful configurations.The padding is very nice inside the bag; I feel my camera is safe inside for travel.""

"20110712","5.0","The real dimensions of the 2400 bag...","This bag is all everybody says it is. I just wanted to clear the air on the REAL size of the INSIDE of this bag as I have read all sorts of various sizes while attempting to research it. Front to back is 6'. Side to side is 9'. From bottom to top of the bag is 6 1/2'. Does this mean you can't get a longer lens inside than 6 1/2', no. I have a Canon 70-200mm IS f4 L lens that is 8 1/4 inches long and it will fit, although just barely. You can get a 8 1/4' lens in the bag because the top of the bag that folds over the body of the bag is recessed and the straps that secure the top of the bag to the body of the bag are slightly adjustable, all of this flexibility allows a maximum of around 8 1/4' from top to bottom of the bag, I doubt anything longer would fit. The inside of this bag will hold my Canon T3i body with grip but with no lens attached, my 24-70mm f2.8 L lens with hood reversed, my 70-200 f4 IS L lens with hood reversed, a JVC HD Everio camcorder. That for all practical purposes fills the bag up. The side pockets are good sized and the mesh pocket on the underside of the top flap will hold a lot of small items like batteries, battery charger, SD cards, remote shutter releases and such. With all the stuff I have just described put into the bag it still is very comfortable to carry over your shoulder, as the carry strap is  wide and soft, but I would not want to carry it constantly for hours on end. This bag seems to be very well made and has good design features as the inside is completely adjustable for any configuration you may need. Gets my high recommendation for a great size and quality of workmanship. If your camera with lens attached isn't longer than 8' total length it should fit in this bag, any longer most likely not.""

WORTH IT FOR SURE!""
"20110707","4.0","Nearly perfect, but for one flaw..","This is a great bag and will be replacing the Canon holster bag I bought just last week.Some of the reviews are all over the place regarding size, but for me it's perfect.  I can fit my T3i WITH the kit lens attached, a 300mm zoom lens, a prime lens, the charger, the user's manual, and a host of smaller items in the bag (including a little point and shoot).  I had to reconfigure the hook and loop dividers, but everything now has a home, with the lenses and the point and shoot each residing within their own padded cubicles and I don't have to jam anything in there to get things to fit.There's one issue I think is kind of serious though and it's been brought up in many other reviews.  The top flap of the bag is secured with the two clips, and that's it.  You had better be mindful of the state of those clips when you grab the top handle because if they're undone, the body of the bag will swivel out from underneath you, and there goes $1000+ worth of equipment spilling onto the floor.  It happened to me while I was initially packing it, but luckily just the charger and a couple cleaning pens were in there at the time.  Yikes.  I'll be sewing some velcro up in there and I will be double checking that the clips are secure from now on.Aside from that, the bag is just perfect for me and my (limited) equipment.  I'll use the holster bag I just bought every now and then but this will be the go-to bag for most occasions.""

This, first of all, is soft and cushy for your equipment, but also allows you to place the dividers in any configuration that you like, not just where someone else thought the strips should go.I'd like it better if the front interior pockets were the same zippered type as the large one in the lid of the main compartment, but for the price I'm not going to whine.Well made, lots of features, inexpensive... great bag.""

I don't see it holding more than 2 lenses, but it depends on how your configure the dividers.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it only latches closed and has NO zipper.  I prefer a zipper in addition to the latches to prevent anything from getting inside the bag especially rain.  If the bag moves the wrong way when walking, part of the interior is exposed and rain, etc. could get inside.""

You can see by the photo uploaded (red background, milk carton for size reference), this case is very compact, but still holds all my gear, with a little 'growing room'.Zippers on side pockets are good quality and easy to zip/unzip.  Straps seem to be attached properly.  The adjustable dividers inside the case use velcro for positioning, providing a multitude of options for segmenting your gear.My only grip is I wish the tripod straps were on the back/middle of the case instead of on the front/bottom.  As you can see, when not being used they dangle down unless you bunch them into a knot or secure via crossover (left strap, right buckle, and visa versa).Still a great, compact, case for the novice camera buff.""

Perfect go bag, as I can fit the T2i with an attached lens and a battery grip in the main compartment, when I need the camera I can grab and go.  No need to attach a lens or add the battery grip, it fits perfectly.  It is well made, has good padding and plenty of options for carrying (shoulder strap or handle).

I had a Belkin before, which I really loved but my dog chewed on it a broke it. My only complaint is that instead of a zipper on the main compartment it has buckles (which is fine) but I am over a 200 lbs. guy and the buckles are hard for me to undue, it takes a lot of finger strength I don't believe someone smaller could undue them. (that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5)""

I keep my Canon camera with the kit lens attached facing down and there is room for at least 3 more lenses.  I keep my zoom lens and my JVC Everio HD video camera in it.  It has pockets of both sides and one zippered on the inside flap.  It's good for traveling since you can take all your goodies.  It is not suited to take for a day photo shoot since it is a larger bag.  When I can afford it, I would also like to get a smaller bag that would hold the camera and one zoom lens to take out of the day.  If you want a nice bag this is it.""

"20101213","5.0","Brilliantly Efficient","The photos do not do it justice. This bag is perfect for the job. The true beauty of this bag is in the velcro dividers; if you have a body (even two) and multiple lenses, then you can remove them to fit everything, and if you have only one body with one lens (like me), you can actually orient the dividers in such way that you can keep the lens attached to the body for quick access. The bag provides more than enough room for cards, batteries, cords, booklets, silica packs, etc. Also, the combination of zippers, velcro, buckles and cinches its superb and to top it off, its size is small enough to be carried around easily, but big enough to provide extra room for expansion. For the price asked, this is a steal. It's a truly impressive buy, Good job Canon.""

I store the camera in the lens up configuration, an EFS-18-55 kit lens, plus an EF-75-300 telephoto lens. All the lenses are in the bag with the lens hoods attatched. In addition, it is also able to hold the battery charger plus a spare battery, and all the memory cards and camera manuals you need to carry along to keep all your camera equipment in one place. The bag itself is fairly lightweight and it isn't too heavy or large to be in your way. It seems to be constructed well and looks great. It also has plenty of padded Velcro dividers that separate all of the items in the bag. Believe it or not, there is still room to fit a few more items if you needed to.

"20120425","5.0","Really good bag for one SLR","one SLR body (detached from lens) and 3-4 lenses or a speedlite can fit in this bag. there's a nice velcro patch on the left/right edges of the top flap to keep it closed if you've not buckled the lid down.  two roomy pockets on the ends, one nice inner pocket for small doodads.  very comfortable shoulder strap, a couple D-rings on the back side to attach it to another pack, and two cinch straps on the bottom to carry a tripod or whatever.  It's a pretty good grab-and-go bag, although I no longer keep my SLR in this bag;  it's been appropriated for holding telescope eyepieces and miscellany!  I actually prefer this bag over the larger Canon backpack, but that one holds a lot more stuff and is easier to hike with.  This bag is better suited for road trips and family events.  If you don't feel the need for a backup SLR body and you don't need to have both hands free to scramble up a trail; get this bag, otherwise, go get the Canon backpack style;  they're equivalent build quality.""

I often walk my dog on my own and photograph nature on our walks.I got my bag today. It only took approximately 3 days to receive it, which was awesome! I excitedly opened it and examined it. It's very well made and had 5 moveable dividers so I was able to customize the bag to accommodate everything I wanted to have available to me when I'm out and about. It has three exterior pockets, one on either end of the bag and one on the front. It has a great zippered net pocket inside the lid of the bag. The straps on the outside bottom front of the bag are intended to hold a tripod, so I strapped mine on. I had enough room in the bag to carry my field guides and journal with me. The shoulder strap has a very nicely padded area that prevents it from digging into my shoulder. For me, the adjustable shoulder strap will allow me to hang the bag on the back of my power chair over the headrest.I would highly recommend this bag to anyone with photography equipment they wish to carry with them. It is well worth the cost and the seller was quick to fill the order and ship the item! Just what I've been wishing I could find!!""

"20101117","4.0","Looks great and holds everything!","There's a lot of good things to say about the bag. The material is sturdy as all heck and can take alot of abuse, while still retaining its shape. I also love the heavy duty bottom Canon created to add structural support for everything. The plastic clips don't feel cheap to me at all. As long as you don't try to rip it open everytime you need something, you should be fine for years down the line. The size of the bag is indeed huge. I keep my Canon Rebel XS with the kit lens, my speedlite 430ex, manual, memory cards, stofen omnibounce, 1.8 50mm lens, a few 50mm filters, my spare point and shoot, my nintendo DSI, and my car keys along with anything else that I might be carrying around in this bag. There's a good amount of pockets and dividers for everything.But like everything else, this bag also has its bad points. The biggest annoyance to me was the shoulder strap. The padding is pretty nice and thick, but does nothing to alleviate the strain of all day use. I do not recommend carrying it on your shoulder for more than a few hours a day as it will tear your muscles apart. The only other annoyance that I can think of is the lack of a zipper for the main compartment. There are hardly any bags out there that offer both a zipper AND a quick release clip however, so it's to be expected. All in all, definitely worth the thirty bucks I paid. I just wish I had never bought that cheap opteka bag before I bought this one.""

"20101013","5.0","Perfect For Presesnt Needs","This bag is  perfect for my present needs, and even has room for another lens in the future.  In the  main compartment I have, assembled and ready to be used, the Canon T2i with  battery pack and 18-55 kit lens with lens hood.  I put the camera in its place holding the hand grip, which makes it easy to put the camera in the bag and pull it out.  Because the camera is fully assembled, all I need to do is turn it on and remove the lens cover and  it is ready for use.Also in the main compartment is the Canon 55-250 lens with lens hood attached.  The lens is positioned with the lens hood up.  The lens with hood is a fraction of an inch taller than the side of the  bag, but this does not  interfere with the closing of the bag or the use of the side pockets.  When the bag is closed, there is no way to tell that with the lens hood attached the 55-250 lens stands a little taller than the side of the main compartment.There is space left over in the main compartment for another lens, which because I have no other lens at present, I am using to hold a pair of glasses in a case.The 2 large, zippered storage compartments on the outside of the bag, plus the storage in the lid and on the front of the  bag, give me all the room that I need for SD cards, a reserve battery pack for the battery pack, cleaning supplies, a camera manual,Attached to the bottom of the bag are straps intended to attach a tripod to bottom of bag.  Initially I was put off by those straps and had scissors in hand to cut them off.  However, remembering that I have a cheap, light weight tripod in addition to my larger, heavier one, and also realizing that this would be a good place to  carry an umbrella when out of days when weather is questionable, I let the straps alone. Now that I realize that they can at least occasionally be of benefit to me, they no longer bother me.The  bag is well made and attractive and the padding and weather protection are satisfactory.""

Just wish however the closing lid of the bag had a zipper to it along with the 2 buckles.

It does get a little uncomfortable after lugging it for about 4-5 hrs. I wish they would definitely put in a zipper to the flap. My extra lens fits in perfectly.

I've recently purchased a Canon EF-S 10-22mm which is a very bulky lens and also carry it in the bag. I think there is still some space in there to fit a Speedlite which I'll be getting soon. The space in the bag is customizable with the 'modular' pads it has. I also carry my iPod and some other small gadgets in it. It's properly cushioned so it protects all the equipment from mild abuse.""

"20100621","4.0","Thoughts from a owner with a 7D + Lenses","My star rating reflects only the quality of the bag itself. As to whether everything fits or not, I believe is my responsibility. I got this bag for a 7D with a 17-55mm F/2.8 and a 10-22mm F/3.5-4.5 + both lens hoods and a basic sunpak tripod.All the above will not fit in the bag if either lens is mounted on the camera. You will have to store the body and lenses separate in the bag to make everything fit. Also, attaching the lens hoods in reverse to the lens for storage will also put the two lenses too close for comfort. Everything has to be taken apart for everything to fit.That being said, if you own no lens hoods, you can easily get both lenses to fit + a 3rd and maybe even a 4th.the tripod hang pretty well off the bottom with the straps. I took this bag through a rock cave and even through all the abuse everything survived fine.I think I will opt for a bigger bag and use this one for my XSi and its two kit lenses. That seems like it will be a better fit.The overall quality of this bag is good. The clips that holds the bag closed works fine. The two side pockets can comfortably hold 3-4 filter cases (B+W sized cases). My only complaint is the strap system for the tripod, It holds the tripod no problem. It doesn't slip. However the straps do have enough play to allow the tripod to shift around does get annoying.Overall, I think I underestimated the size of my gear and got a bag that's too small for me. Can't blame Canon for that unfortunately...If anyone has any specific questions for me for want a picture of how I have my gear arranged let me know.""

"20091223","4.0","Notice the measurements","Well made, well designed, excellent bag.  Knew what I was buying and not disappointed.

"20091211","4.0","Insulation","Overall, I rate this product reasonable for the price but want more insulation in the case. The soft case is a kind of thin and does not provide enough protection. Five inner pads allow to cutomize the inside to accomodate a camera and accessaries. The height, however, should be higher. I can confortably put in an Canon EOS Rebel XSi with 55-250 mm telephoto lens horizontally. But if I do so, there is no extra space to put a standard 18-55 mm lens.""

I have no problem with my 50mm f/1.8 and camera w/ another lens mounted all in there.Cons,If you have a moderate sized telephoto lens and don't want to lay it down in the bag (I don't coz it takes too much room), you will find it difficult to fit it in. I mean the height of the bag will be the limitation for your lens after you buckled it up. That's the reason I can not give it five stars. Anyway, this bag is a good shelter for normal sized lens. You can even fit in three lens plus camera body there if you are creative.""

You can configure it as per ur requirement. Initially i used to keep the camera and lens in the separate compartments. But this bag also have a T shaped compartment where we can keep the camera along (attached) with the lens, which makes it easy.I had one issue with this bag. It has two straps, shoulder strap and a short one for carrying it by ur hands. Many a time i ended up picking the bag by the short strap and since it's attached to the top cover, the bag opened (the latches were not locked in) and the lenses fell down.

I hold my Ti, three flashes (Yongnuo YN-560, and two Yongnuo 462's), four CowboyStudio/Cheaplights receivers and one CS/CL trigger, one AA/AAA/9v charger in the main compartment. Just to give you guys an idea....It's great if you don't want anyone knowing you're a photographer as well. Hence why I bought this instead of using my Canon 2400 bag...'Hope this helps!""

"20120305","5.0","Cheap Insurance Policy for Protecting Your Investment","Last spring I ordered a Canon EOS T2i for the Journalism Department at my high school where I am the yearbook adviser. When my order arrived, the only thing in the box was this gadget bag. I'm thinking what the heck? Fortunately, my camera came two days later, so I guess this was a freebie. Not only that, my photographers have been getting lots of use out of this.There's plenty of room for the camera and the flash. There's a zippered mesh pouch on the underside of the cover of the main storage area. There are zippered pockets on the outside at each end of the bag for easy access for items like extra batteries. There's also a zippered pouch that runs the length of the bag, but it can really only be accessed when the carrying straps have been unbuckled. The adjustable shoulder strap, however, is a real plus.I get real nervous when I check out a thousand dollars' worth of camera equipment to a student, and this padded, soft-side bag goes a long way toward protecting my cameras. While I got this one free, at full price it's still a cheap insurance policy for protecting your investment. RECOMMENDED""

"20090103","5.0","Fantasic bag!","This is a great camera bag. I was looking for something larger than my small Lowepro camera bag that can only carry the camera body with a small lens attached. I've recently added a few more lenses to my arsenal, so I needed something bigger to accommodate my new equipment. I looked into the Canon 200DG bag, but thought it was a little too bulky and overkill for my needs, so I decided on this one. I'm a beginning photographer and do not have that much equipment, so I thought this bag was a great fit.I'm very glad I picked this bag because it is just right for my needs. It fits my Canon Rebel XTI body, 3 lenses (Canon macro 100mm f/2.8 lens, Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens, and a Canon 75-300mm lens). I could probably squeeze in another small lens if I made extra room. I can also fit my filters, extra batteries, extra memory cards, and other small accessories into the pockets. It's durable, easy to carry, and waterproof.I'm very happy with my purchase and I highly recommended this bag.

"20081230","3.0","Good but small","It is a nice bag and I'm keeping it, but the description of what it will hold is a gross overstatement.

If I take out all the dividers, it will hold a 30D mounted with a 17-85 lens and hood, and that's about it.  It will be good for those occasions when that's all I'm taking with me.""

Too bad Canon doesn't make any bags that are better fitting for their smaller SLR cameras, that don't have all that extra room for other lens and cameras. There is definitely a market for bags that can contain just one camera. Canon should take advantage of it. I would recommend getting Caselogic or Lowepro.

"20080819","4.0","Canon 40D, 28-135mm lense, hood, flash, no more room left","When I first bought a digital SLR, I didn't realize how important a camera bag is. They are meant to hold everything you need, when you need it, so you can keep it safe and carry them around. The 2400 bag does just that, BUT only if you have a small quantity of equipment. I initially purchased this bag for my Canon 40D. For those who own one, they are quiet large in size. The picture that amazon shows doesn't really do justice unless you compare to a real size camera. I am only able to fit the body, 28-135mm lens (attached), including lens hood, and a speedlite flash inside. I am unable to carry anymore inside the main compartment. The rest of the compartments has the capacity to hold extra batteries, filters, and pamphlets just in case.If you are serious about photography, you would want a bigger bag so you can carry more equipment. In general though, its a nice bag for those who don't use other lenses.Also, the strap is not as long as you would expect. It barely allows you to carry on the shoulder, but it does.""

Side pockets accommodate film rolls or your memory cards, filters, charger etc. I've been afraid that the bag will not fit the above gear, but all fits nicely with plenty of spare room. The dimensions on this Amazon page are incorrect (maybe they're outside dimensions?), the actual inside is (WxHxD)  9.5'x7'x6' .  The bag is perfect size, not too big, just enough to carry an SLR/DSLR and up to 2 lenses plus accessories. If you'd need more space then a bigger bag would be better but then it would be bulkier and not so easy too carry around. I'm thinking to buy another one  for my Mamiya 645 ProTL camera kit with 2 lenses, 2 film backs, hoods, filters etc. Also, bag appears to be well made and is nicely padded for good protection against impacts.

"20080327","4.0","Great bag for a low price","After ordering a few more lenses, I realized that I should get a bag that fits more than just my camera. this bag currently fits my XTI (fitted with one of the following lenses), 50mm, 85mm, 28-135mm, and a cheapie fisheye setup with a 28-70 tamron lens and an opteka adapter.  It also fits my remote, card reader, extra card, lens cleaning kit, and still has room for my fuji instax mini 10 and a pack of instax film, as well as my wallet, card case, cellphone and keys.  the loops on the outside bottom nicely hold my monopod.  I also have a 580ex II flash which can fit in the case but I usually leave something out since the flash unit is pretty big and I like to keep it inside it's case to avoid damaging it.Inside the case, it has those adjustable foam pads with velcro which are setup to fit about 4 lenses, plus your camera body w/ 1 reasonably sized lens.  The two side pockets are roomy and fit plenty of odds and ends.  It has a zipper pocket on the top inside which fits a lot of items.  The front zip section has two small pockets and can accommodate plenty of stuff (this is the section where I keep my wallet and such)The shoulder pad kind of sucks and the plastic clips that hold the strap on the case squeak rather annoyingly if you have a lot in the bag.  This is why I gave it 4 stars.  I would suggest that if you need to carry this bag all day, you might want to invest in a better strap and shoulder pad.I don't know how waterproof it is, but it seems reasonably weather resistant.  You can probably buy some weatherproofing spray if you're really worried about it.""
"20080327","5.0","Durable and spacious bag for a great value!","I was very hesitant before I bought this bag because I was reading a lot of mixed reviews and such: Some people said that it only fits the camera body and a single lens, while others said it fits much more Some others said certain lens's couldn't fit in it etc...I finally decided to just go for it and bought the camera bag, and was very surprised and pleased at what I got. The bag seems small (compared to some camera bags that I've seen) but it is very roomy!Some issues that people have with this bag is that the dimesions advertised are not accurate, but after I measured that bag I found that the dimensions listed are more or less correct. The website states that the 'Bag measures 11 by 8.7 by 7.9 inches (width x height x depth', and this is true, because these are the OUTER measurments of the bag. The INSIDE measurments of the bag are actually 9.5 X 7 X 6 inches (W x H x D) as specified by the manufacturer on the bag itself.I've been trying to fit my camera and accesories to see if I can get everything in there, and it turns out I can, with leftover space for more things that I might add later on (the removable dividers are great!). So far my bag can fit the following:1 Canon Rebel XTi Body with Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM (attached onto the camera body)1 Canon Lens Hood and Case (included with the EF 70-200mm lens)1 EFS 18-55mm Lens1 Lensbaby G3 and Aperture disks1 Lensbaby Close-up kit (includes 2 lenses)In the front and side pockets, I'm able to fit:6 Camera Filters/Lenses (4 close-up lenses, which are inside one large case, and two other filter, each in their own case)1 Small Card reader1 Battery Charger and Cord1 iPod (as well as usb cord)A few other small accesories here and there as well as my camera's manual bookletAnd to give an idea of how much empty space I have left over inside the main compartment, I can fit about 2 more EFS 18-55mm Lens, and nothing is squeezed!I'll probably need a bigger bag as I purchase more lenses and accessories, but for now this bag is recommended if you want something small, durable and roomy to fit all your camera accesories, while still maintaining easy access to your equipment!""

I put the camera with one mounted lens on one end, face down, supported by the hinged cushioned dividers. There's room outside these dividers (between which the mounted lens belongs) for the lens caps and extra battery. My two unmounted lenses fit vertically along one side of the remaining space, leaving the other half for adapter and cords -- and as a temporary space for switching lenses. There's a flat pocket at the front of the bag that's perfect for the user's manual and any other flat item such as lens papers. That still leaves the two box-shaped pockets on either side. And it's all very snug.""

"20070924","5.0","Worth it!","Originally purchased for my 6 yr. old Canon D30, four lenses (Canon 18-55 EF-S, Canon 50mm, Canon 75-300mm USM, and Sigma 28-300mm), and a Promaster 5750DX flash with flash module. YES, I was able to fit EVERYTHING inside. Oh did I mention that the camera had a battery grip attached? Oh I guess not. Well, that was in there too. It's all about rearranging the dividers. This product truly matched my expectations. Now, this bag houses my newly bought Canon 30D ( I thought it's really time for a body update) also with a battery grip, and now with a Canon 430EX flash. Everything still fits perfectly. Love the small pouches around the bag, and the tripod sling on the bottom. No more worries of travelling with my DSLR and what to bring. Now, I can say my camera and lenses are truly on the go. The best bag out there, for the price, for hobbyists like me.""

There is plenty of room for my Rebel XI, the 18-55 mm lens, and all the cords, manuals, etc. that came with the camera.  Now to the gripe:  The main compartment lid is secured by two push clasps.  Very sturdy, but it needs a zipper in my view.  When the bag is loaded and on my shoulder the bag flexes to reveal a gap between the lid the the main part of the bag.  The means my gear is exposed to the elements more than I would want (or expect in a camera bag) and little stuff might fall out (not likely, though).""

"20070727","5.0","Great for Any Brand!","This camera bag was originally purchased for a trip I took where I wanted a nice carrying case for my camera gear.

In the side pockets, batteries and chargers, and even my stofen mni bounce fits. I still have the lens kit and my memory cards in the case as well.

"20070717","5.0","The Perfect Case.","The Canon bag is great for larger cameras and accesories like lenses,flashes and filters.  It is well constructed and well padded to protect the investment I have in my camera.  The velcro dividers are well padded and make customizing the interior of the case simple with endless alternatives to accomodate your needs.  The shoulder strap is wide enough and well padded to make carrying it comfortable.  The front and side compartments are large and handy to store camera accessories as well as personal items for day trips.I love the case.  I tried to find something negative so this review did not sound like a marketing broucure, but I could not find one.  I suppose someone looking for a color other than black would consider that an issue.  Canon does subscribe to the Henry Ford school of color...'give 'em any color they want as long as it is black.'  For all the features and convenience this case offers I would have expected the price to be a lot higher.  It is a real value at the price.""
"20070709","4.0","Value","Product found to be as advertised.  Much lighter than my old leather bag.  Good interior padding and movable partitions with velcro strips.

Pockets hold lens/CCD cleaning kit/brush, USB cord, high speed card reader (uses same cord as camera), extra black media, six 2GB cards and a portable 80GB drive for the laptop (this stays in hotel while out taking pictures).

The inside is super configurable which is great 'cause you can set it up the way that is best for the accessories you have so that everything fits, but doesn't move around.This same bag cost almost double at Best Buy and other retail stores so it's a steal here at Amazon!  I LOVE it!""

"20060809","5.0","Great Bag","I have had this bag now for over 9 months and can honestly say it has more then surpassed my expectations. It stores everything I need when out with family or friends to catch all the action in one convenient place.In the center of the bag I have the following:1. Rebel XT body2. Canon 430EX Flash3. 17mm-85mm Lens4. 75mm-300mm Lens5. Sony Handycam Video Recorder6. Power plug for charging Video RecorderOn the sides I store the Battery Chargers and Batteries for Flash, Camera and Video Camera, plus Tapes for the Video Camera. The front holds all the manuals for everything and a few extra Memory Cards and lens covers. Even after this, there is still space in the bag for other things.

"20060629","3.0","Overall a nice storage bag.","This is a good looking convenient bag. Has lots of compartments and tons of stuff can fit in. In general works pretty well. Here are a few drawbacks:1. The divider is set up in a way the body and lens need to be separated to be stored. I used to have a lens attached to the body all the time in my old Tamco bag and this is new to me.2. My 70-200 F4/L is too long to be stored in there. Which is not a gignatic lens.3. The partition desgin is not that flexible.Then I have only had this for a week and not sure if i know all the tricks yet.""
"20060616","5.0","Spacious bag at a great value","If you're reading this review now, then you must be debating on whether to purchase this bag or not.  My answer would be to buy it!!  Initially I bought a samsonite bag, but I quickly out grew that one. This canon bag (after repositioning the velcro dividers) can fit all of the following:1. rebel xt body w/ the kit lens attached2. Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II3. Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM Telephoto Zoom Lens4. Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash5.

Not including all the film, batteries,cleaning supplies, ect.  I liked it so well, I purchased a second one for my old A-1 and its accessories.""
"20060320","3.0","Great value but smaller than expected.","I purchased this bag for my Canon digital rebel XT. It's durable and well built. Some what smaller than advertised but I'm sure it's ideal under most circumstances. Perfect if you have a camera body and single lens. However, I returned it in exchange for the Canon 200DG bag which is larger and could accommodate up to 3 lens, camera body and accessories easily. The 2400SLR bag has plastic latches, rings and zippers. The Canon 200DG has heavy metal latches and is constructed with thicker padding and heavy duty zipper and pouches. The price of the 2400SLR is very reasonable and a great value for the money. But, if you are planning to carry a camera body and 2 or more lens, I would not recommend this bag.""

In accessory pockets, I can store an extra battery and wall charger, diffuser for the flash, 50mm macro lens, product manuals, 2 cases for filters, lens cleaning solution and remote switch.  The top zipper case in the lid contains spare lens cap, lens cloths and several memory cards.  A lot of stuff that fits nicely in a bag that is, in my opinion, inexpensive.The bag is well constructed.  Zippers work smoothly, clips are made of heavy duty plastic.

"20051223","4.0","Great Camera Bag, best value around!","When I was looking for a camera/gear bag, I first checked the usual suspects: Lowepro, Tamrac, etc. They had the product I was looking for; however, at a price that was out of my budget. I then decided to check our Canon's. To my surprise and delight they had exactly what I was looking for: something semi-hard, protective, weather-proof and within my tight budget. I ended up deciding for getting couple of these guys and am nothing but satisfied. This bag is spacious and exactly as advertised.If has configurable inner dividers so you can customize how it fits your precious equipment. Very easy te get things in and out of, and it can pack a lot! I usually carry my camera with a 28-135 lens attached, two other lenses, batteries, a few filters, couple of lense's hoods and a few memory cards. It all fits and everyting stays in place.

Plus, there is room for another lens (a soon to be added zoom lens).  Plenty of compartments and zippered pockets around the perimeter for carrying accessories.  It even has a strap on the bottom for carrying a tripod.  The bag is lightweight, water repellant, and has the interchangeable dividers so you can arrange the interior contents into any configuration you like.  Well worth the price and works fine unless you plan on carrying more than 3 lenses.""
"20051213","4.0","Good bag, but wish it slightly bigger","The description of the capacity is fairly accurate. I can tightly fit in one Digital Rebel+18-55 zoom, one 50-200 zoom, one 10-22 zoom, one 50 prime, and one flash. The camera body barely fits the space.

I wanted a bag that's big enough to carry all my digital gears. After looking around at Wolf Camera and other retailers, I decided to give this bag a try. It turned out to be a GREAT decision! With re-arranging the dividers included, I was able to fit the above gears plus a couple of D8 tapes, SONY camcorder power cords, Canon battery charger, Canon user's manual, additional film memory into this medium show-box sized bag. It is the least expensive and great quality bag around. Highly recommended to anyone with similar needs.""

"20120112","5.0","The right size bag for my needs.","My fiancee and I recently received a Canon Rebel T2i SLR from my parents as an engagement/Christmas present.  The package included both an 18-55mm lens and a 55-250mm lens.  For our needs, the bag is an appropriate size.  It has compartment side walls that are removable/adjustable with velcro, which offers at least a little bit of flexibility in how you lay out the interior space.  The sides themselves are soft and padded to keep your SLR and its accessories safe.  Adequate pocket and sleeve space throughout for everything we would hope to carry with us and the bag itself is sturdy and compact.As of now it is carrying the following with a little room to spare:- Rebel T2i SLR Camera- 18-55mm lens- 55-250mm lens- Set of 3 lens filters in their carrying sleeve.- Joby GP3 Gorillapod SLR-Zoom (and it's BH1 Ball head with bubble level)(the Gorillapod rests across the top)- Battery charger- Manual- LensPEN- Lens cloth- USB cable- 2 SDHC memory cards- Extra batteryI think we could squeeze a 3rd lens in there if we opt to buy one in the coming months, but that would probably put the bag at or near full capacity.""

"20111122","5.0","Fits Anything Reasonable!","This camera bag will not hold 20 lenses, a tripod, and your sandwich. Personally, I say 'Thank God for that!'. What it does do is a great job of holding three lenses along with your camera and some small extras. There are plenty of pockets for lens cleaners, etc., while the bag is still very well padded.I have found you can even stuff more than three lenses into the bag (yes, along with the camera, etc.), but at the penalty of double stacking some of your smaller lenses. If you spent your life's fortune on lenses then I certainly wouldn't recommend doing so, but if you're in a pinch and have some less expensive lenses you can shove together, why not? It fits them quite comfortably.This would be a hard camera bag to beat. Holds everything and is well padded.""

Fitting all these lenses takes a lot of organization skills, but it's maxed out. I don't think 5 lenses will fit..Also, it has pockets for my filter sets.Bottom line: This is a good bag if you want to minimally carry your camera and a couple favorite lenses.
