"20120601","5.0","Light Padding, But Good Because Of It","A lot of camera cases have 'firm soft cases.'  Not this one.  This case is nothing but mesh and foam.This allows for modern slim cameras to be protected against most damage without being so bulky that it can't be carried in-pocket.  My new camera (Canon 300HS) can easily be carried in this case in my pocket next to my phone without worry for my phone or camera.And, unless it gets thrown around or dropped off a balcony, it's plenty protected against most bumps and drops.The design is great, with a fast-opening zipper that is exactly as long as it needs to be, and no longer (no more opening camera cases like a suitcase).The front pouch isn't awesome but, whatever - I could keep 10 loose cards in there, if I wanted to, so at least it's roomy, and leaves the entire interior of the pouch for the camera, alone.  That's a great feature that many cases lack - inside the shell, with your camera, it nothing but protective foam.It's light, so don't go stepping on your camera or dropping it down a flight of stairs; barring those types of incidents, this case is ideal.""
"20120529","4.0","Nice and cheap but very dependable.","This is a really nice case. When it isn't inside my purse, I use the carabiner clip to attach it to my pants loop for easy access.  Even when I don't zip it, like when I'm using it a lot for a trip or a school function, the opening is high enough up that the camera does not fall out.  There seems to be a good amount of padding that keeps my camera safe and sound, and the front pocket is nice for keeping an extra SD card, battery pack, and a little slip of paper with my contact information in case the worst happens.  My Polaroid camera has plenty of room inside the pouch.  The case seems to be fairly waterproof, since there have been times the outside has been moist from a slight drizzle or perhaps even sweat, but my camera stays dry--even the little information paper has stayed dry!  It's a good camera that isn't bulky.  Not bad for something I only paid between $4-6 for.""

This is not going to work with your tightest jeans but I think it'll go in most pants pockets or a man's shirt pocket, with a slight bulge. There is also a belt loop for that option.

The two zippers are strong and easy to use.  The spring loaded aluminum carabiner (belt clip) is very strong, light weight and fairly easy to use.  It's a nice feature that I may try to add to a different bag if I can find another carabiner.  As others have said, you can attach the carabiner through the large belt loop on the back side of the bag instead of the small loop on the top of the bag.

"20111215","5.0","Cheap & Perfect","I upgraded to a Canon HS310 which was slightly larger than the SD940 it replaced.  So I needed a new case.  It's tiny, comes in many colors, fits perfectly, holds an extra battery in a separate compartment and was low cost.  I just wished the zippered opening was larger, but minor complaint.  Plus, won't help much if camera is dropped.  I like it.""

"20111214","4.0","Snug Fit","I bought this at the recommendation of Amazon to go with my new 'Canon PowerShot SX230HS'.Construction: Well built, appears to be nylon fabric.  Has a thin piece of foam for padding inside the top and bottom sides of the case.  I would not intentionally drop my camera in this, but it looks like it would provide some protection.This case is a very snug fitting.  The Powershot SX230HS does not really fit.  I can jam it in there, but it's hard to get the zipper closed.  To be fair, the Powershot is a thicker camera because the lens adds 0.25' to the body.  This case would probably work fine with most compacts.""

Not too snug. The frontal pocket is quite spacious. I use it to store an extra NP-BN1 battery. Just to give you an idea on the pocket's size; I put both batteries and an SD card inside it, and it seemed there was still more than enough room to put a couple more batteries too.Has a bit of padding from the inside. Would give added protection to your camera. Case has a belt loop and a carabiner, so you've got some choices in how to carry and attach.The case *seems* waterproof. Haven't actually had it out under the rain, but I did hold it under running tap water. Didn't seem that water went in. (I could imagine a bit of water would sneak in through the zipper though, but I guess it can be called 'water-proof'). Don't take my word for it though and purchase this case with the intentions of walking around under showers of rain with your camera. Try to research more about it. Or hit me with a comment and I'll put the case through more 'stringent' water tests.All in all, I'm happy with the case. Would have liked if it was just a bit smaller. There's extra unneeded room when the TX5 is in. Not that the case is big or bulky. But a bit smaller, for the TX5, would have worked too.A recommended buy if the dimensions work with your camera.""
"20111204","3.0","bad QC, that is all","It's a perfect fit for my Canon S90. The side pocket is perfect for a spare battery, mem card, etc. There's both a belt loop and a wimpy carabiner clip for two levels of security. It's great design.

It's a nice case and will definitely protect the camera from scrapes and minor falls, but it's not super thick or super padded - which is a plus for me, but might not protect the camera from severe drops or such.

The carabiner works great as a belt loop attachment, or you can use the wrist strap from the camera to carry it. I have a neck strap attached to the camera to have the camera readily available while I attach the Case Logic to a belt loop. I haven't tested the protection capability fully since the only drops I've had were pretty minor, but I didn't want a bulletproof case that is too cumbersome to use and carry around.

"20111017","4.0","Fits snug","This case is great for carrying around your camera on a trip. It won't fit a charger, any cables, etc, but its not supposed to. It will fit a spare battery and a couple SD cards. It has plenty of padding on the front/back of the camera, but is lacking on the sides. It is seems to be only meant for carrying around the camera with this clipped to you.The accessory pocket is a bit small. While it will fit a couple SD cards, and 1-2 batteries, it would be a bit difficult to use any protective casing on the batteries and have them still fit. It also really has no padding in front of the accessories, so they can get damaged fairly easily. Instead it has a pointlessly large pocket of inaccessible space in front of the accessories.. why they would intentionally add space to the case without giving more storage and not providing extra padding with it is beyond me. As far as I can tell it is solely there so you cant see the outline of the accessories.The 1 star loss is for the poor design of the accessory pocket, but if that doesn't bother you this case is great otherwise.""
"20111017","2.0","Disappointed","While I received this item on time, the item itself is lacking.  It is small, barely big enough to hold the Canon Power Shot A3300 IS that Amazon suggests getting for the camera.  It is advertised as having 'storage' which is a joke.  With camera in the case, the 'storage' will only accomodate a spare memory card.  The price of $5.90 is very reasonable. I am considering returning it as it isn't what I want in a camera case.""

Good case, nice bright color to go throw inside my purse. Sufficient padding although not as much protection as a hard case would provide but I also ordered a second hard case for that purpose. No shoulder strap only the clip and belt loop on case but a longer lanyard could possibly be switched out from the hand strap on the camera and pop it out through top where camera zips up if one wanted to carry it around their neck.

If I had checked the dimensions of my camera against the stated interior dimensions of this case (some of which were smaller than my camera's dimensions), I never would have ordered it.

When I checked my camera in this function, it stated that the correct Case Logic case for it is the TBC-303 (which is slightly bigger than the TBC-302).I read all of the Amazon product reviews for the TBC-302, which were from owners of various camera models including Panasonic Lumix models.  Many were happy with it, some were unhappy (like me), and some managed to make it work by shoehorning their camera into it or otherwise compromising with it.  But that's not my game.  I'm not happy with a camera case giving me these kinds of issues.  I don't need it to be so small as to fit into my pocket if it's going to give me problems with fitting my camera into it.The lesson here is: don't be overhasty to order something just because it appears on the Amazon page of something else you are ordering.  Check out the details to make sure it's right for your situation.""

The camera fits fine, but I leave the strap hanging out of the case. The external pocket holds the extra battery and an SD card, maybe 2. And that's all. VERY snug.Protection is minimal, the case has no room for padding. It is simply a cover, something to keep the camera and accessories together. Then I can toss the whole thing in a coat pocket or my car center console and be on my way.I opted for a compact camera, why make it medium sized again with a large case? This one is perfect.""
"20110919","4.0","Great for my Nikon Coolpix S3100.","When I compared the actual dimensions of my camera to the published dimensions of the case, I was worried that it would be a tight fit.

The zipper is a bit awkward to open when suspended by the loop. However, the case is quite secure for my camera even with the xipper open which makes it nice for quick access to the camera.

Most days I'm carrying a Lumix around in my pants pocket so I wanted a snug fitting case that wasn't too bulky and the TBC-302 is great for that.  Each camera slid right in without a problem and there was no difficulty in zipping the case shut.  With a camera in the case the outside pocket still held 2 batteries and a memory card case without a problem (other than making the case a little bulky for carrying in a pocket).This case offers protection from scratches and a little moisture.  If you want a case that is shockproof and waterproof then keep on shopping.  It seems to be well made and something that will last.  It comes with a clip to hang the bag from a belt loop and you can also run your belt through a strap on the back of the case.  I tried attaching the case to my belt and didn't have any problems with getting my camera in or out.REGARDING REVIEWS SAYING LUMIX WON'T FIT:  If you search on Lumix in these reviews you will find some reviews saying the bag is too small.  I looked at the negatives and found that the only two from 2012 were in January.  I suspect that Case Logic had a quality control problem in the past.  No complaints in the last 4 months makes me think they have addressed that issue or have slightly increased the case size.  Obviously, that's just a guess on my part.""

I am able to easily slide the camera in and out and don't have to mess with opening the zipper all the way across the case.  These cases are nice in that the zipper only runs from the 10 o'clock position to about the 5 o'clock position.  It makes it so much easier to open and close in a hurry.  As mentioned in a earlier review, the carabiner seems very tough and the stitching suffice.  It seems to be enough cushion to prevent any damage from routing drops and dings.Very roomy for my ELPH.In the case I have at least 2 spare batteries and at least two extra SD cards in cases.  I run my micro tripod through the carabiner when I am not using it and it keeps it there so I won't lose it.I have bought the Black and the Blue versions and they seem to be identical and sufficient.""

"20120504","3.0","Too Small to Include Charger","Most of the cases recommended for your camera are going to be too small to include your charger. This compact case holds my Canon S100 nicely, but it's a bit dangerous to travel without the charger. And, who travels with the charger in a separate location? My advice is to get a case that is slightly oversized for your point and shoot, so that you can always bring along the camera's charger. I know that most point and shoots will last forever on a single charge, but consider this-- Lipo batteries, which are used in almost all P&S cameras hate the cold. I went snowboarding a lot this winter and my battery would only last about half the day, a couple dozen photos before it was dead. In 80 degree weather the same battery lasts hundreds of photos.""

I even manage to cram in a tripod mount for gorilla pod into mine with the battery and extra memory card.

The fit is a tiny bit snug but as long as you put the camera in with the wrist-strap sticking out, the case zips up easily. I hate oversize cases that make my camera feel three times larger in my bag, so this one is perfect; it feels nicely protective without being bulky.""
"20110619","4.0","Good camera case","As said before me, this camera case fits the Canon S95 perfectly. Along with the camera, it can fit an extra battery and one or two SD cards (without cases) comfortably in the outside pocket, albeit a bit tight.That being said, there's several things you should consider:If you are going to be carrying a camera that fits in this pouch, then the camera is certainly jeans-pocketable (not sure about the skin-tight jeans). I would say that simply carrying the camera in your pocket is much more convenient and offers similar protection (it is a &lt;1 mm thick piece of foam covered by nylon; it's going to protect against abrasion, but not any 'real' impact damage). Plus it is safer in that it draws less attention to you: having this pouch fastened to your belt is having a sign on your back saying you are carrying at least $300 worth of electronics on your person, something you don't necessarily want to broadcast. You may ask, then where do I keep my memory cards and batteries? I still do keep them in this case, but I keep the case itself tucked in my backpack. I keep the camera in my pocket for quick and easy access.I found a previous review hilariously true: the case is indeed a bit geeky: I have the black model, and the outside is covered with black and grey nylon, a bright yellow Case Logic logo (which can be cut off) along with two dangly zipper pulls. The inside is completely bright yellow. This may not be repulsive for everyone, but I wouldn't recommend toting this to your next wedding or fancy gathering. The Canon leather case may be a better option, but I'd rather just keep the camera in my pocket.""
"20110619","2.0","good size, but the zipper would scratch your camara","It is tiny and fit my S95 perfectly. However that gives no room between zipper and camera. It probably won't cause damage when camera is sit in. But when I took camera in and out, the zipper scratch camera's paint.""
"20110617","4.0","Good Buy","I purchased this for a Samsung TL210.  The fit is really good, not snug or tight, but just right.  I also like the zip pocket in front.  With my other digital cameras in the past I had no need for a pocket, but since this camera uses a micro sd card I keep the adapter in the zipper for use when I want to unload my pics.  Although I would never use it, the loop on the back will come in handy for those who want to strap this on to their belt.  The carabiner is very useful as well.  I will mention before I purchased this I went to Case Logic's website to make sure this would fit my camera.  You simply have to type your camera model in, and they will bring up the cases that fit.  I see a lot of reviewers complaining that the case is tight because they relied on amazons recommendation instead of going direct to the source.  For $6.57 with shipping you really can't beat it.""

"20110606","4.0","Almost perfect, with a very good belt loop","I needed a case for a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS6 and this is the one people seemed to like the best.  It is a soft case with thin padding sandwiched between a rugged outer covering and a lighter weight nylon liner, sufficient for protection from most accidental drops without adding a lot of bulk.  Over the years, I've grown to prefer carrying my small point and shoot cameras on my belt so being able to do that is a critical factor for me in any case design.  This one has a well made belt loop, wide enough for most belts, and both rugged and tight enough to securely hold the case in place on your belt.  In a recent trip to the Med, I carried the camera this way for the better part of 3 weeks without any damage to the case or camera.  A carabiner clip (and attachment loop) is also supplied, which while not a very wise way to carry a camera on something like a belt loop, is probably effective with something like a purse or backpack.While the case is effective, I do have a couple of complaints, which is why I'm rating the case 4 stars instead of 5.  First the fit is a bit too tight for my DMC-ZS6, since in zipping it up the the zipper may sometimes trigger the off/on switch (a minor issue as it turns out, since the camera has a sleep mode that cuts in after a set number of seconds on non-use).  Since the DMC-ZS6 is a tad larger than most cameras in its class (it has a larger lens), this would not be an issue with most small point and shoot cameras.  Second, the zipper pulls, while commendably cloth wrapped to reduce the risk of their scratching your camera, have a tendency to fray, although it does not appear the fraying will lead to actually loss of the wrapping.Over all I am pleased with the case and will continue to use it when traveling with my camera.""

"20110428","2.0","A pocket or purse case at best","This case is easy enough to use, but has some serious deficiencies in quality. I purchased this case along with a camera (Canon Powershot SD1400IS) for use on an outdoor vacation. Started with the case attached to a belt loop using the caribeaner/loop feature of the case. This setup did not even last half a day of walking around before the loop broke (on the camera, not my pants) and dropped my camera to the ground. Fortunately, the case is padded and my camera was not harmed (definition: mixed blessing). I then switched to the belt loop feature to attach the case to my belt. This lasted the remainder of the day, but when I took it off that evening, I noticed that the loop was pulling away from the case and was literally hanging on by a thread.Both carrying/attachment features had failed by the end of the first day of use. On the plus side, the case did protect my camera in a fall that resulted from those failures. I would say that this case is probably only useful for purse or pocket use, and would not recommend it for attachment to a belt or strap. Then again, it is less than $6...""

The case is textured so it is easy to hang onto, and the small size of the case (and camera) allows it to fit easily in a jacket pocket.  There is also an aluminum caribiner so you can attach the case to your belt loop, back pack, your keys or whatever else you got to have attached to the case.The case has a small side pocket that will easily hold a back-up battery, memory card, etc.  The pocket is about 2.7' x 3.5', about the size of a folded dollar bill.I've been using it for about 6 weeks and I judge it to be well designed, well made and durable.""

But to my surprise and delight, it does fit my camera.  Yes, it's a very tight fit and I can see why some people would be concerned about scratching the LCD screen but is the LCD screen really that important.  I've enjoyed having small pocket size cameras and carried them in my pocket and have scratched the screen on all my cameras.  With this case it allows me to carry it clipped to my belt loop. Yes it's a tight fit but would you rather carry a bulkier case? The reason we bought a point and shoot camera is so that we can carry it everywhere.  This case suits that purpose.

However I do have a couple things I would like to say if you are going to pair it with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS7. It's a little small of a case for the camera. It's VERY snug. I find that when I have the camera in the case with the memory card in the front pouch it's almost tight enough to give me trouble pulling the memory card out of the pouch. There is also little padding for the camera. If you were to drop it even in the case I wouldn't be surprised if something happened to the camera. It's also a little annoying that when you put the camera back in the case and zip it up, sometimes the zipper turns the camera on, so I had to put the camera in the case upside down.Not a bad camera case for the price but I would have probably gone with something better like a lowpro case with added padding and maybe a shoulder strap.""

I can put the camera in and zip it closed without the zipper hitting any part of the camera.  In my opinion, those who claim otherwise are not pushing it down all the way.  Also, the pocket can probably hold 2 extra batteries and an extra couple SD cards for this camera (narrowly).However, I did not want to give it 5 stars because the loop for the carabiner, as others have stated, appears to be fragile.  So, I just hooked it around the case's belt loop and then hooked the carabiner to my pant's belt loop.  It works great that way.

This case does meet those requirements well.  There are two problems I encountered: 1) The case is a REALLY tight fit for the S95.  That means it is a bit of a challenge to get the camera out quickly especially if it is on your belt.  2) The zipper is only a little more than 1/3 the length of the outside of the case (90% of top plus about 65% of one side in length) which contributes to make it hard to get the camera out with one hand.The construction and look of the case are very nice. The extra compartment is perfect for a spare battery. I knew it wasn't a hard shell case so there are no demerits for that in my ranking but the fact that the case is so tight means that there is relatively little protection for the LCD screen.If the S95 was a little smaller this case would work better but I found myself struggling to get the camera out and therefore this is going back.""

The case that has a defective zipper teeth looks like it is bent to one side, so every time the zipper is pull across the bent teeth then the zipper will bind a little bit, and the defective teeth will not catch on to the teeth across from it.  Other than the defective zipper, the caselogic pouch is a perfect fit for my Canon S95.  There is no wiggle room when the Canon S95 is put into the case, and the extra front pocket has enough room for one spare Canon S95 battery and it is a tight fit too.  So if you are looking to put a spare battery and one extra SD card into the front pocket, then it might be a challenge.  Unless you put the SD card in the front pocket without the SD card case.  I will not go through the problems of sending back the defective case, because it cost me less than $8.00.  The defective case zipper still works, just a binding when the zipper is pull across the defective teeth.  For less than $8.00, you can't go wrong with this purchase.

For the price, I am very happy and in fact, if this case had cost five times as much it would still be worth it.Since I'm not a professional photographer, I can't comment on this case under harsh and daily use, but for the amateur photographer, it's a steal! Highly recommended.""

It has a front zipper pocket large enough for about 2 SD memory in individual casings - comfortably. Or 4-6 SD memory cards (no-casings) and a small LCD cloth. Even the main compartment with my Elph, can house a couple of SD memory cards, a few credit cards, some cash and a drivers license or so. There is a belt loop attached on the back end of it and a good size Carabiner with an effective latch (best part, IMO). Overall great on treks (city, woods) or at a casual gathering.""

The case with the above-described items in it won't fit in your pants pocket the way the S95 would all by itself, but it's very unobtrusive on your belt and easily thrown into a backpack or briefcase.""
"20110308","4.0","Nice case for teeny tiny cameras, but not for Panasonic Lumix ZS7","I just purchased a Panasonic Lumix ZS7 from Amazon and am looking for a case to protect it. I read a few reviews on this case that referenced Panasonic Lumix and/or ZS7, so I ordered one. Don't make the same mistake I did!This case is too small for the ZS7 (or any similar size model). Once you cram it into the case, it really takes some effort to get the zipper closed. I'm afraid of the zipper scratching the new camera. Since return shipping costs almost as much as I paid for this case in the first place, I'm stuck with it or selling it online elsewhere.I'm giving the product a good rating because I do like the case, it just doesn't fit my specific camera, which I had no way of knowing until after ordering it. There could be more cushioning, so like others have mentioned, I wouldn't expect it to protect the camera very well if dropped from several feet. But to protect from scratches and average jostling around, it's decent enough.Update: I checked out a few stores in my area, taking my camera along with me for a fitting.If you like the looks of this case, but want one for your ZS7 or similar size model, check out the Case Logic TBC-303. The camera will fit, with room to spare, plus has the zippered storage pocket on the front.  Similar to the TBC-302, it will hold the camera and offers some protection from bangs and scratches, but isn't likely to protect your camera much if dropped. The big-box store that starts with a 'W' is selling it for nine bucks in my area.If you want something with more cushion/protection, I would recommend the Case Logic QPB-202. It has a plush interior with thicker cushioning along with a hard molded front. It wil fit the camera inside and has a mesh pocket for memory cards and an extra battery. Definitely feels like it would better protect the camera if dropped from a few feet up. I'm buying it from Amazon for less than ten smackeroos. The 'W' store didn't carry it and the office supply chain had a higher 'Max' price, over thirteen bucks.""

"20110302","3.0","The product itself is fine, but in this case...","I have one of these for my Canon PowerShot SD960, it works perfectly. However, it is waaaaaaaay too small for the Canon S95, which is recommended along with the camera. The Canon S95 is thicker, and because of the way the lens is built, I could hardly close the zipper after putting the camera in this case. Needless to say, the spare pocket is competely useless since it's such a snug fit for the camera itself already. I had to return it to Amazon.If you are looking for a case for Canon S95, go for the TBC-303 model. I ordered it as a replacement to this TBC-302 model, it works just fine now. Camera goes in with room to spare, and you can easily fit extra battery and SD card in the spare pocket.After this experience, I've come to the conclusion that the camera case Amazon recommends along the side of a camera often runs one size smaller, so to be on the safe side, it's better to order one size up.""
"20110302","5.0","Nice and useful for Canon S95","As many have noted, this is a nice case with a snug fit for the Canon S95.

"20110220","5.0","Simple. Easy. Done.","This mini camera case is simple and well made, and it fits my pocket camcorder with a bit of room to spare (though not too much). Don't expect to fit a lot in the way of accessories, but the front pouch will fit several Compact Flash cards and SD cards and/or a couple extra batteries without a problem. The belt loop feels sturdy, and the eye hook is well made, though I'd be wary of the small loop of cloth holding the eye hook to the case. I did expect slightly more padding, but it isn't bad as long as whatever is inside it is reasonably light. There is enough room for me to add extra padding inside if I want.I don't appreciate that it is made in China (without getting into anything political, let me just say that I don't like buying from China). Unfortunately it is becoming nearly impossible to find consumer goods that are made anywhere else. :( If you can find a case like this made in the US, or at least anywhere else, buy that instead! In fact, tell me so I can buy it for my other small camera. :)Overall, this doesn't even need the couple small paragraphs I just wrote about it because it is so simple and basic, but with me that's just par for the course, heh.

I then palm the case as a primary means of carrying it, sometimes with three of my fingers inserted inside the belt loop.  What this does is the camera is secure in my hand while the camera is spared from the immediate environment and my sweaty palm.  The carabiner is then used to clip onto my front belt loop when the camera is in use.  The spare outside compartment is used to store extra battery and SDs.

This means you have to delicately place the wrist strap so that it doesn't get caught in the zip when you are closing the case.2. The belt loop is fixed. I personally prefer a clip or a velcro belt loop. I know these are slightly less secure, but having to remove your belt to put on a camera case is quite awkward.I'd also prefer a velcro clasp rather than a zip for fast access to the camera but I knew this was a zip before I purchased it.You are always trading off one thing against another.FWIW, I also have the official Canon S95 case but tend to use this one since it is more compact, fits in an additional battery in the front pocket.""

"20101221","4.0","Roomy for my Sony DSCWX5/B","It fits my DSCWX5/B and still there is little room both on top and side of the camera (enough width to fit a AA battery - just to give an idea)Looks nicely built and has nice padding on all sides. Has an extra pouch on the outside to fit a spare battery and memory card.I would definitely recommend this to anyone.""
"20101218","5.0","Great product","Great case, fits my Nikon Coolpix S570 quite nicely with some room. Camera is smaller than the case but not too roomy to be knocked around everywhere unlike the oversized case I bought as a package in the store. Side pockets are nice, fits my extra battery and two SD memory card cases well with some extra room for maybe one or two more memory card cases, or maybe a total of 2 extra batteries and two SD memory card cases. Belt loop seems quite secure as well.""
"20101218","5.0","fits Canon Powershot perfectly and is very well designed","First, the color.  I purchased this item at a discount and only the orange was available.  Initially, I was displeased with this fact.  I'm not really an orange oriented person but it has worked out.  The case is immediately visible when I place it in my purse or back pack.  If I had chosen black, I could see how the case, which isn't that large, could be a little  more difficult to immediately identify.I love the clip.  Some of the places I travel to are known for pickpockets and thieves.  I clip the camera case to a hook within my back pack so that if the back pack is torn open, the thief would have a little extra work involved to get to the camera.All in all, I think this case is designed very well.  There are a couple options for harnessing it to your person or another item. You can clip the case to a belt or a back pack or actually slide the case over your belt as it has a belt loop.I love the extra storage that is on the front of the case.  This supplemental space has room for a battery and/or SD card.  You could also fit money inside or a credit card(s).  The credit card did take a little maneuvering but it wasn't difficult to insert inside the storage area.  If you have thicker fingers, I don't think it would be difficult to retrieve items inside the supplemental compartment as it is fairly large space; the supplemental storage area has a zipper spanning the front of the case so it isn't like you have to retrieve your items from a one inch slit.I would buy this product for others.""
"20101218","5.0","Case","This case is very sturdy and feels like it will hold up, however do not expect this case to protect your camera if it is to ever fall. There is not much padding in it at all.""
"20101217","5.0","Perfect little case","I had wanted a smaller camera to always have on hand so that I did not have to always carry my Nikon DSLR. 'Santa' gave me an early holiday gift of Panasonic Lumix and I needed a small case.I loved the orange and gray combination that was available in this bag and, for the low price, decided to give it a try. This soft sided case is very well made, fits my new Panasonic perfectly, and is not too bulky but will offer some protection - not as much as a hard shell of course, but I didn't want anything hard and bulky .The clip on the case  is handy as is the small outside pocket - large enough for a spare battery or card. I am very happy with this little,  easy on the wallet but well made, gem of a case......orange too......perfect!""
"20101217","4.0","Its really good for a small camera","I brought it for my Canon SX210. It seems like the camera barely fits in the case. I should have brought a little bigger case. But it does the job.. I can put the camera in the case (with lil extra effort) and it fits in it. Design is simple and elegant. I wish if they had send a tie or a small belt along with that.All together its a nice one for a small camera... Not a home run for Canon SX210""
"20101212","5.0","Nice, snug fit for Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20","I've been using this case since I purchased it in September 2010 and I'm very happy with it. I wanted something that would not add bulk so that I could carry it in my purse. This case has been perfect for that purpose. The carabiner also allows me to clip the case to the metal ring of my purse strap when I want it out and available for quick access (i.e. on vacations). As many other reviews have mentioned, the case is lightly padded and it has a small outer zip pocket that can fit a memory card and/or battery.""
"20101205","3.0","Good, not great case","Bought this case to use on either a Sony W370 or Lumix (Panasonic) FP8. Either one fits well, with the Lumix a bit tighter fit.  If you have a Canon that you want to carry extra AA batteries, I don't see how they will fit in the side zippered part on the outside, but of course memory cards will.  And personally I don't buy cameras that use AAs, it's either a rechargable or I'll pass.Good value for $7, but I like the LowePro REZO 30 a lot more for another $4 or so. It has two zippers that can meet anywhere, the TBC302 only one that goes across the top and a little more than 3/4 on one side.  You can't lift the camera straight up if you need to.The metal belt clip is cool.Nikon L22s, etc will also fit well.So, I think I'll use this for a stay-at-home case and the LowePro for carrying around because it also has an adjustable neck strap.""

The quiet zippers can be opened and closed discretly anywhere, without tugging or getting stuck to other fabrics. It's perfect for my Panasonic compact digital camera, and should fit several models.

"20101121","5.0","Good pocket camera case","I bought this case for my Nikon Coolpix S3000. It fits the camera nicely with a little room to spare and does everything you'd expect a camera case to do.""
"20101121","4.0","A decent case","I bought this to contain my new Canon SD1400IS. It offer reasonable padding and a soft interior so the view screen is not scratched. The interior is very roomy for the camera; perhaps more than it should be, but, the camera easily slips in and out of the case. I like that the zipper only opens part of the top and part of one side making it less likely that the camera will simply fall out of the case when the case is opened. The outside zippered compartment is roomy enough to hold three extra bateries plus a couple of extra SD cards as well. I think I would have preferred to have a separate compartment or maybe some pockets in the outside compartment for the extra memory cards. A nice feature of this comparment though is that the zipper opens only a bit of the compartment so that the compartment is still left as a 'pouch' so that the contents don't spill out as the zipper is undone. The carabiner connection is a nice touch; I keep the bag hooked to my front belt loop.  Overall, a pretty good case that does just what I want.  Well worth the price.""
"20101120","3.0","OK for the price","I bought this case to hold my Canon PowerShot SD1400 IS.  The camera swims in this case.  The camera is thinner than my last and I didn't realize it would make this big of a difference.  The camera fits ok and I'll continue to use the case but would have liked it to be thinner to match my camera.  I like having the extra pouch on the face of the case; store a couple sim cards.  Construction of the case looks nice and I don't see any sewing flaws.  There is a loop that connects the zipper tab to a cloth tab for pulling (two places); the loop is oddly shaped.""

"20101118","5.0","Perfect compact case","No frills, but does it's job very well, which is to be compact and protect the camera, which is what we wanted.  Enough storage for a couple of extra memory chips - but you'll have to leave user manuals, etc. at home.""

"20101111","4.0","Bought for Canon SD1300","Bought one of these for my new Canon SD1300 camera. Camera floats in the case...probably 1/2 inch extra in both length and height.

"20101104","5.0","Nice case but I think it's too small for an S95","It's a really tight fit, and as others have noted it seems likely that the zipper slide will scratch the camera.

If you have a camera with any part thicker than 2's then this will be very tight or not work. Luckily I have a small digital camera (that I also purchased here on amazon) that fits perfectly.

It's not too big or too small for the Samsung SL605, enough give but not swimming either.  I also like the smaller overall size of the case itself, which makes it fit in my purse better.It also zips open very easily to quickly slide my camera out so I can get that quick picture, especially when it's hanging from the little carabiner clip from my belt loop.  If the little light clip fails, I will most likely take a stronger clip and put it through the belt loop on the back just for security.I am a purple fan, so the magenta color is terrific and easy to find.

There is enough padding around the camera to protect it from minor bumps while wearing the case.  The zipper pouch will hold two extra AA batteries and a SD card, but nothing more.  All together, this set up is not too bulky, but you do notice it when you have it on you.  It also fits great inside my wife's purse when I'm too lazy to wear it!For the price and features of this case to hold a smaller P&S camera, look no further.""
"20100827","4.0","A pretty good little case for the money","I ordered this case to hold my Canon 960IS and it does the job pretty well.  The dimensions seem a bit conservative as there should've only been about .1' of room on two sides and it's definitely roomier than that.It seems solidly built with stitching that is pretty heavy to handle a bit of abuse.  It also comes with a carabiner clip and a belt loop if you are the type to make your belt look like Batman's and accessorize the bejesus out of it.  The one thing that I wish this had was a heavier nylon.  It's much more lightweight than I'd have liked, along the lines of a thin padded nylon instead of the more hardcore deniers.  It's also very squishy, not rigid at all like the picture makes it out to be.The storage pocket is a good size for carrying a couple things but don't expect to carry around all of its accessories.  As a lay type of measurement I stuck my (adult male) hand into it and it basically is the exact size of my four fingers wide and my fingers can go in to about the second knuckle.  It's not QUITE large enough to put a Canon battery charger in but it could easily hold a spare battery, SD card, and/or cable.  That's alright, though, because the case is made more as a tiny holder than a camera bag.  Here it all is in a nutshell:PRO's:-Small and perfect for the newer, smaller point and shoot cameras-Carabiner means you can clip it to whatever, quite handy-Everything is stiched up well-Accessory pocket can hold true accessories that you'd need while out (extra batt, memory card)-full length loop on back means you can play superhero or attach to whatever you want depending on your needs and  creativityCON's:-Very squishy and lightweight nylon.  Better served as a secondary line of protection (as in it's in your bag)-Storage compartment opening all of .1-.2' shy of being able to squeeze a Canon battery charger-Zipper D-Rings are fairly thin metal so they may snap off over time, leaving you zipper pull-lessCONSENSUS:Great little item for the everyday person who is just looking for a tiny bag to put their camera in.  I don't think it'll hold up to the rigors of heavy outdoor use or other types of abuse but it's a great item for the price.""

"20100811","4.0","Case may be too small","I purchased this case without knowing its size and dimentions.  I read many reviews about this case, and thought for the $9.99 I had a deal on my hands.  The camara case came in the mail today and I was excited to open the package; only to find a 'tiny,' little case!!  My GE A1250 does fit in the case snuggly; however I thought that the front pocket would hold the batteries for the camara, it looked that way online... but this case will not carry the camara securely with batteries in the front pocket, maybe a memory card, but definately not camara and batteries!!  I will say that I am satisfied with Amazon.com as far as the ordering and shipping of the case.""
"20100810","4.0","Sturdy, rugged","Looks and feels sturdy. I haven't had much occasion to drop my camera yet, but no doubt I will at some point (given my history) and I think it will keep my camera safe. You can hook the case to your jeans, less heavy pants probably will not bear the weight of camera. And there's a handy side pocket for easy access for extra card and/or battery.""

"20100806","4.0","Clip needs better anchor","Belt clip needs a better anchor.  The metallic belt clip appears sturdy, until you realize it is anchored to a small loop on the case.  Such a secure clip needs to have something as sturdy as the larger loop where a belt could go through below the smaller loop on the case, a loop that matches the strength of the metallic clip.""
"20100805","5.0","Great case for S90 with a nice surprise","I ordered the Canon S90 (review soon to come) and I was looking for a small & nice little bag that isn't expensive. So I stumbled across this one here and I have to say it is the perfect case for the S90. It fits great and there is a small front pocket for a spare battery and/or another memory card.I even dropped my camera and the case protected it well - not a scratch. And the best is (it didn't say it anywhere nor did I expect it) - it came in a set of 2 bags. Wow, so now I have a spare one or I can use it for my charger.I can only highly recommend this bag for the S90!!!! Great value for your money""
"20100730","4.0","Tight fit for the Canon S90","I purchased this case based on the recommendations of other reviewers but I think the case provides too tight of a fit for the Canon S90. I spent time fighting to get the camera out of the case. I would recommend the CaseLogic Medium Camera Case instead. It provides more room and has the attachment to attach to the belt as well. It's just like this one but it wider and deeper and makes it easy to get the camera in and out of the case. The construction is just as good as this one.""
"20100728","5.0","Great investment.","This case is fantastic in every sense of the word.

"20100726","5.0","Stylish, Roomy, Highly secure and very easy to carry.","Love the case, the design is a lot better than I expected from the photo. It has a very sleek and sexy appearance and surprisingly very well padded. I have a Canon Powershot S90 and this case is perfect for it. The zip outside gives me sufficient space to easily store two spare batteries. The clip is extremely useful as well. it holds on tightly. I did feel however that the tag around which the clip loops around is not very securely stitched so I clipped it to the larger loop on the backside instead. Highly recommended! Its a lot cheaper than buying the Canon case for my camera, and I liked this design way better anyway.""

"20100719","5.0","Perfect little case","I bought this case to replace my old CaseLogic case because it didn't have a spare pocket to hold small accessories. This case is small and light enough so that I can carry it around all day without noticing it that much, but it is has enough room and padding so that it carries my camera (Panasonic FH20), a spare battery, and a SD card and it protects my camera if I drop it.I would recommend this case to anyone looking for the perfect travel case for their ultra compact camera.""

Perfect case for this camera and the few esstentials you need to bring along.""
"20100702","5.0","Awesome S90 Case at a Bargain!","Bought this case awhile back for myself and a friend and used it for storing our Canon S90 cameras.  The camera fits snugly in the case and protects it well while the mini side pocket is perfect for a secondary battery. The case is inexpensive and does the job for most S90 owners out there and most importantly, doesn't up take up any unnecessary space.  You can also find it for cheap at your local wally world.""
"20100630","4.0","perfect 4 playsport","The TBC-302 is a pefect fit for the Kodak PlaySport Zx3 Video Camera.I decided on this case for my new playsport because of the multiple ways I can carry this case. You can even run a shoulder strap through the belt loop if you really wanted. It has the clip which I would use most of the time as the kodak playsport is pretty light and so is the case. Most importantly it still fits comfortably in my pocket wearing average khaki pants. This means I can easily have the playsport in the case and then store it all in my pocket if I prefer or am somewhere I may not want to publicly display my gear. Going to a concert? perfect. Going to an Opera? sure, why not (its in your pocket). Going to beach for some waves? definitely as it fits in a side pocket it will fit comfortably in my swim trunk cargo's pockets. except I will prolly try to find a way to attach the clip to something in the pocket just for peace of mind. Would hate for a massive wave to tumble it out of the velcro cargo pocket. So just about every scenario or outfit I could think of this case seemed to fit the bill perfectly.The only con for this case and my one concern is the lack of padding. I just dont feel it would protect any electronics from a fumble/drop. Maybe just a bit of foam around the rim would be perfect as nothing ever seems to fall flat.I have a vid on youtube that shows how well the playsport kodak fits into the tbc-302 case as well as a solution to the weak and frail clip loop (add better clip to belt loop)which can be found here searching on youtube for video titled 'Playsport Kodak inside a TBC-302' or copy and past the following url:[...]* I tried to upload the vid here but it doesnt like the format (.3gpp2l from an LG ENV2 phone vid) and I dont feel like converting it just for amazon.""
"20100627","4.0","Great Case, Roomy - Clip not really useful, but not a problem.","Great compact case, use it on my Canon S90, front pocket holds a spare battery and memory card perfectly. Thought the silver clip at the top would be very convenient for attaching and removing from a belt loop quickly, but it bounces around somewhat awkwardly while walking. The clip is easily removable though if you're not using it. If you want to attach it to your belt, I'd recommend slipping it through the slot on the back of the case instead. I tend to put it in my pocket or carry it by hand.""
"20100626","3.0","Snug fit for DMC-ZS7","I read this was a good case to get for the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 so I ordered one at the same time I ordered my camera.I got them on the same day and was happy.I like the case, it is padded and has a little pocket in the front, but I was hoping the pocket was a little bigger.  You can't really fit anything in there.. maybe a SD card, but it can't have to bulky a case and there is no way a battery will fit in there.As for the camera, I liked it at first, it has a snug fit and seemed perfect, but then I realized how unperfect it was.  I put the wrist band on it and all the sudden it was way to hard to close, I was afraid I'd scratch it trying to get it zipped.  I found a way around this by turning the camera backwards facing away from the pocket.Another thing I noticed and I HATED was when it was turned the right way with the wrist band on (not sure about without it.. only noticed after I put it on) is that the fit was TO tight that sometimes when zipping it up the zipper hits the on off switch and tries to turn it on.. which isn't good cuz the lense has no where to go!  Again, turning it backwards seems to help with this, but I still have to be real careful when putting it up to avoid hitting it...I like the snug fit but at the same time I wish it was a little bit bigger, I'm afraid if I am in to big of a hurry I might accidently hit the camera with the zipper or something.""

I hate the cases they make for Ipods, because they don't consider the headphones (and my small fm transmitter.)  This is PERFECT! I have a nice protective leather case snapped around the Ipod, and this case still has enough room to fit it in, plus the headphones and transmitter fit nicely in the front zipper pocket.  I can clip it to anything or slide it in my pocket like a wallet.  Looks like it would be great for almost any camera too.""

It is well constructed, and the extra storage pocket is adequate for an extra memory card and a spare battery.  Don't expect to fit much more in the case, though.There is enough padding to protect the camera from the typical jostling and moderate bumps that come from normal use.  The carabiner-style clip is handy, but it is not bomb proof.  If I could make one improvement to the case, it would be to make the clip loop and its stitching more heavy duty.Overall, this is a good case for the price, and I would purchase it again.""

"20100603","5.0","Very useful small case for small cameras","I like this case so much I have since purchased a second one.  It easily holds cameras the size of the Canon SD950 or S90.  The front pocket has a nice zipper and can hold a spare battery and extra memory without bulging or getting in the way of removing or replacing the camera.  One of the nicest features it has is the cloth hook on the back that holds a caribiner.  That makes it very simple and fast to attach to a purse loop or a pants belt loop.""

"20100508","4.0","EXCELLENT CASE FOR THE CANON SX210is","I bought this case for my new Canon SX210is and it is an excellent choice.  I wanted something that would fit into my pocket.  I simply couldn't find any other case that would hold the camera, have an extra zipped pocket for a battery and/or memory card and still slip into my pocket.  It also comes with a Caribiner for snapping onto a belt loop, backpack, etc.  It is nicely lined with foam to make you have feel a reasonable degree of safety.  However, I wouldn't feel very secure if I happened to drop it on a hard surface.  That is the only reason that I did not give it 5 stars.Previously, I had a Canon SD780 with a Caselogic UNZ-2 Small Universal Pocket w/Screen Protection (Black/Silver), a nearly perfect choice in a case for that size of camera.  It comes with a screen protector, very nice.  I love that case.  It's only short fall is the lack of an extra pocket for a battery or memory card.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars for that reason.  But, it slipped perfectly into and out of my pocket.  It is also very nicely padded.  I would have felt reasonably secure if I had dropped it on a hard surface.  Both of these are great camera cases if you are looking for one that fits into your pocket comfortably.""

The price of $6.80 (amazon) was also a factor.I discovered an added bonus. I had been searching for a case for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 Digital Camera on amazon without success, and so this review is meant for other Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 Digital Camera owners. This case fits my Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 Digital Camera extremely well. When you tuck in the wrist strap, it'll be snug, but that won't prevent you from zipping it all the way.

"20091222","5.0","It saved my camera","I recently purchased a Canon S90 to complement my 5DmkII on a safari in Tanzania.  Throughout the trip I had the S90 on my belt for quick and easy access; the case isn't bulky and seemed to protect the camera well enough from the occasional knock as the land cruiser hit big bumps.On my last day in Tanzania I was walking through the streets of Arusha when suddenly I felt a hard tug that almost spun me around.  I turned to see a man starting to flee.  I started off in pursuit--concerned more about the memory card than the camera itself--but after a few steps realized the camera was still at my side, only a slight rip in the strap indicating anything had happened.Recommended as a sturdy carrying case with a reasonable amount of padding for impact protection (you won't want to drop it from very high or expose it to strong blows).""

I agree with the others to hook it on the belt strap instead of the flimsy loop.2) The lining inside the case should be cloth instead of vinyl.  The material might scratch the glass on the viewer of the camera.Other than these two things, the overall design is good for a small digital camera.  I like the side pocket for extra memory cards or battery.  I have a Sony DSC-TX55.  It's not tight fitting and has lots of extra space, but it will do.  I am just concern about the linning not being cloth.  I will try it because the functionality suits my needs.  Plus, I can't find a case small enough for a Sony DSC-TX55.""

I have a camera strap on my camera and the zipper up top stays sturdily closed with the strap peeking through the closing, thus easier and more secure to carry, and without the extra 'time nuisance' of always having to push the strap inside the case.The padding is on the lighter side, especially compared to my Lowepro pouch, but it should be enough to protect the camera from a hip height short fall.  If you're one to constantly drop camera cases, then I suggest you get a more padded case as I don't feel that this has enough solid padding to buffer against *constant* falls......on the flip side, I wanted a non-bulky case and overbuilt padding cases adds to annoying BULK, and this case feels much sleeker in a jean pocket or cargo short pant and besides that, I really USE that metal clip on the jean loop b/c it's so darn fast and convenient, and thus assured against any fall.P.S.....Be aware that this is the TBC-302 at 3.9' long.

"20120220","5.0","Doesn't fit Nikon S9100","Nice product, but the Nikon S9100 doesn't fit well in it and it got returned.  Kind of disappointed that it came up as an option when I purchased the camera from Amazon.""
"20120219","5.0","camera case","Works perfectly for my new camera and keeps it safe from scratches and inadvertent drops.  Received in a timely manners.""
"20120217","3.0","It does the job","Looks good, but not impressed with it... You get what you pay for. It's Not water proof, Not a hard case, just enough storage for camera, memory card and extra battery (Nothing else) and worried about the tag in the case scratching the lcd, so I ripped it out, also worried about the zipper scratching the camera when sliding in the camera because its kindof a tight squeeze, so I bought a lcd screen protector for 5 bucks. It's not bulky so its easy to put in your pocket, Like I said... it does the job""
"20120215","5.0","Good fit for Canon S100","Fits perfect. Looks well made. Love the orange/grey color. It even has a small pocket at front for extra battery or memory card.""
"20120215","5.0","Good camera bag at a good price","This is a good camera bag.  No-nonsense and has great utility!  I had it for a year and it's the best compact camera bag I ever owned.  Very reasonably priced to boot!The design and shape is perfect size for my Canon S95.  Ever forget or drop your camera bag? Well, not anymore, I have a leash on my camera so I let it loop into the built-in aluminum hook so I never drop the bag onto the dirty or wet floor..I just let the lightweight bag dangle when I take a picture. Great design!  It doesn't scream attention and says 'steal my expensive camera,' but yet elegant enough not to look cheap.  There is a zipped front pocket for my 2nd battery and extra sd card in the front of the bag.  All of these storage and they all fit in my jean pocket.  Much cheaper and more utility than the official Canon leather case.  It's waterproof so any splashes on it would be repelled by the nylon case.I'm usually very careful with my camera gear, this is soft case so if you are looking for a more rugged look and protection, get something sturdier. But, if you want a good, soft, lightweight, and pocketable protection for your compact camera, this is for you.""
"20120215","2.0","Flimsy quality","Very Basic....no strap..lower quality...I would spend $5.00 more and get something that has substance..I will not be using this item because I want something that is better quality with a strap...""
