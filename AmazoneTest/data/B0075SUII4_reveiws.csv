Perfect for my mountain biking and bird watching trips when I don't want to carry my expensive camera equipment around for fear of damaging it. Don't let the size fool you, it takes great quality photos & video! Fits in my pocket so I never miss  a good photo opportunity. I've even gotten some excellent  bird and wildlife pictures made clear & sharp by the stabilized zoom! I was really pleasantly surprised at the quality of this camera. Canon cameras are the best!""

You could not ask for a better price vs performance camera. Very simple to use, excellent picture and video quality. I would suggest getting a cushioned camera case that includes the USB thumb drive reader for $10, the case is perfect for travel and storage when not in use. The USB reader is a great option when offloading the memory card.""
"20120606","5.0","Good buy","I like the camera quite a bit. You can force flash, which was a feature missing on earlier models. The movie mode is not so great - it's rather jerky, but DOES have a microphone.""
"20120604","1.0","Not what it seemed","I really wanted a camera with a view finder, it had one of those alright, but so tiny and when putting in the batteries I felt it was going to break it, cheap plastic construction. it was so not what I expected, returned it the day after I received it.""
"20120601","3.0","Canon A1300","Canon A1300 Sure ShotPros - Has an optical viewfinder !! - a must have in bright sunlight  Uses two AA batteries !! - can buy at almost any store  Confortable in your hand and fits nicely in shirt pocket or purse  Takes a very good still photo  Takes a very good HD Video with good single audio (non-stereo)  Can also take a fairly good standard video  with single audio - good for saving SD Card space  Audio sounds fairly good when having to video in gusty wind conditions - as compared to some other brand cameras  Very easy to use and easy to switch back and forth from Auto to Low Light, etc  and easy to switch back and forth from flash and no flash  Video button on back is separate from the still shot button on top- I like that because I take mostly videos  Very good camera for the priceCons - The videos and still photos are occasionally very blurry and non-usable - as though the auto focus has failed  ( I just turn the camera off and start over again (reboot) and then it is fine )  The optical viewfinder does not show the zoom in/out when videoing but the the LCD does show the zoom in/out while videoing  Does not come with an SD Card - Camera does not have any internal memory so you must buy an SD card  Standard AA batteries last only about one hour when videoing - I recommend using the rechargeable batteries to save moneyConclusion - I like this camera and I would give this camera at least a four star if it were not for the above listed cons - This camera is an  inexpensive point and shoot pocket camera and I recommend this camera.""
"20120601","5.0","BEST LITTLEST DIGITAL CAMERA","i bought this camera because i have an canon eos rebel and many time the size of rebel complicate to move freele . in the comparison between this two, i can said that this canon a1300 taking photos during daylight has the same performance like the eos rebel but in little body presentation. however at night you can program the exposure to 800 or 1600 iso and you can increase the exposute +1/3 or more to increase the light on pictures. i recomend this camera because has the best relation between size/price/picture cuality.""
"20120531","1.0","Will be returning this camera","Really not impressed with this camera in the slightest. The pictures have no depth of field, lots of pixel artifacts, and after the first 50-60 shots, a dark grey cloudy spot appeared just below and to the right of the center. I have cleaned the lens multiple times, this cloudy spot hasn't moved or lightened.I will be returning this camera to Amazon.""
"20120528","5.0","Mega Kudos to Canon for their PowerShot A1300","As a full time professional photographer for 15 yrs. now retired, I was dissapointed  not to find a quality pocket  camera  with anoptical viewfinder, until now. I consider this a critical part of any camera that is not an SLR. LCD screens should not be the onlyfinder on a camera. I have been using the A1300 for a few weeks now. It has performed perfectly in a great variety  of situationsand lighting  conditions in both auto & program  modes. The viewfinder  tracks with the optical 5X tele. very well. Am very serprisedat how good the 20X digital zoom & stabilization  are.The LCD is bright and adjustable. In the real world of point & shoot photography, not lab tests, this ultra compact took really good photos! Very happy it  uses AA cells. I use Ni.Mh rechargeables &always have extra Alkalines along.. Batt. life has been good. This is the easiest, most fun and now my go to camera. The A1300 is aVery well thought out and executed point & shoot camera.  Thanks Canon for making something we really need at a veryaffordable price!""
"20120521","5.0","Great backpacking camera.","I purchased this camera as a replacement for my Nikon Coolpix that quit working after less than two years and probably less than five-hundred pictures.  I use this camera when I am backpacking as it is very lightweight and uses standard AA batteries.  My first experience was this month on a fifty mile hike of the Foothill Trail in South Carolina.  There are many waterfalls and beautiful views and I wanted to take some great pictures.  I was extremely happy with the results.  I returned home with about sixty photos and loaded them to Picassa with the idea of editing and correcting any problems before sharing them with friends and family.  None of the sixty needed any retouching.  They were perfect both in exposure and color rendetion.  Some of the pictures were taken at night of my campfire with the camera set on the A (automatic) position.  They were great.As usual, buying through Amazon was a perfect transaction.""

"20120518","4.0","Great Point and Shoot","I love this camera, I got it to replace a camera my kids poured Sprite on.  This was in my price range and the quality is phenomenal.The only con I have with the camera is there is no stabilizer, so if your hands are shaky, the pictures may or may not come out blurry.  I haven't played around with the settings too much yet so there may be a way to cut down on the blur.For the price it is a beautiful camera that takes crisp clear images.  The zoom is amazing as well!""

"20120430","5.0","Great Camera","I bought this camera because I needed a smaller digital camera with a viewfinder, I use it for work and am outside in West Texas where the sun makes a camera screen unusable. This camera has made my job a lot easier keeping me from having to go back to take more photo's.""
"20120414","4.0","Canon A1300","Smal portable camera east to operate even without reading a manual if you are used to digital camera, excellet picture quality, even when in moving car the stabilty is supurb. Zoom is good except the last 6x zoom which is digital once it hits the limit of the optical zoom the digital is almost worthless. However for fast snap shots on the fly it's a nice working camera and the price is about right. This was used to replace a Pentax digital camera. The pentax would not accept the 64 gig flash disk but the A1300 does. Easy to handle comfortable to hold and like that it's not just another sqware box. Night flash works good and face detecton is nice too. would buy another one.After haveing this camera for a short time have found that the memory card and battery has issues. Buyer beware of this issue you will try to take a picture and it dies out have tried new batteris and everything sending it to factoy for repair""
